OBJECTIVE: To compare the primary care consulting behavior, prior to diagnosis, 
of people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with controls, and to develop 
and validate a risk prediction model to aid earlier SLE diagnosis.
METHODS: We included a total of 1,739 incident SLE cases practice-matched to 
6,956 controls from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Using logistic 
regression, odds ratios were calculated for age, sex, consultation rates, 
selected presenting clinical features, and previous diagnoses in the 5 years 
preceding diagnosis date. A risk prediction model was developed from 
pre-selected variables using backward stepwise logistic regression. Model 
discrimination and calibration were tested in an independent validation cohort 
of 1,831,747 patients.
RESULTS: People with SLE had a significantly higher consultation rate than 
controls (median 9.2 versus 3.8 per year), which was in part attributable to 
clinical features that occur in SLE. The final risk prediction model included 
the variables age, sex, consultation rate, arthralgia or arthritis, rash, 
alopecia, sicca, Raynaud's phenomenon, serositis, and fatigue. The model 
discrimination and calibration in the validation sample was good (receiver 
operating characteristic curve 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.73, 0.78). 
However, absolute risk predictions for SLE were typically less than 1% due to 
the rare nature of SLE.
CONCLUSION: People with SLE consult their general practitioner more frequently 
and with clinical features attributable to SLE in the 5 years preceding 
diagnosis, suggesting that there are potential opportunities to reduce 
diagnostic delay in primary care. A risk prediction model was developed and 
validated that may be used to identify people at risk of SLE in future clinical 
practice.

Objective Pulmonary involvement in paediatric systemic lupus erythematosus 
(pSLE) is not an uncommon finding; however, subclinical affection occurs more 
frequently. Many studies have reported that cytokine dysregulation as 
interleukin-17 (IL-17) over-expression plays a key role in the pathogenesis of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We aim to assess serum levels of IL-17 A and 
their association with pulmonary involvement in children with SLE. Methods Serum 
IL-17A levels - determined by solid phase sandwich ELISA - were assessed in 
forty-two pSLE patients and compared to 45 age-matched healthy controls. All 
patients were subjected to pulmonary function tests to detect subclinical 
pulmonary affection. High-resolution CT (HRCT) chest scan was carried out in 
patients with abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and those with chronic 
respiratory symptoms. Results Abnormal PFTs were found in 73% of patients; of 
them, only 25% had abnormal findings in HRCT chest. Serum levels of IL-17 A were 
significantly elevated in pSLE patients as compared to healthy controls ( 
p < 0.001). The serum levels of IL-17 A had a highly significant positive 
correlation with SLEDAI ( r = 0.811 and p < 0.001) Strong negative correlation 
was found between serum levels of IL-17A with both FEV1 and FVC ( p < 0.05). 
Conclusions Serum IL-17A is elevated in pSLE patients, which correlates with 
disease activity. IL-17 seems to have a possible role in the pathogenesis of 
subclinical lung affection. Abnormal PFTS may be found in pSLE patients even 
with normal radiology.

Objective The lupus impact tracker (LIT) is a 10-item patient reported outcome 
tool to measure the impact of systemic lupus erythematosus or its treatment on 
patients' daily lives. Herein, we describe the responsiveness of the LIT and 
LupusQoL to changes in disease activity, using the systemic lupus erythematosus 
responder index (SRI). Methods A total of 325 adult systemic lupus erythematosus 
patients were enrolled in an observational, longitudinal, multicentre study, 
conducted across the USA and Canada. Data (demographics, LIT, LupusQoL, BILAG, 
SELENA-SLEDAI) were obtained three months apart. Modified SRI was defined as: a 
decrease in SELENA-SLEDAI (4 points); no new BILAG A, and no greater than one 
new BILAG B; and no increase in the physician global assessment. Standardised 
response mean and effect size for LIT and LupusQoL domains were calculated among 
SRI responders and non-responders. Wilcoxon's test was used to compare the LIT 
and LupusQoL variation by SRI responder status. Results Of the participants 90% 
were women, 53% were white, 33% were of African descendant and 17% were 
Hispanic. Mean (SD) age and SELENA-SLEDAI at baseline were 42.3 (16.2) years and 
4.3 (3.8), respectively. Mean (SD) LIT score at baseline was 39.4 (22.9). LIT 
standardised response mean (effect size) among SRI responders and non-responders 
were -0.69 (-0.36) and -0.20 (-0.12), respectively ( P = 0.02). For LupusQoL, 
two domains were responsive to SRI: standardised response mean (effect size) for 
physical health and pain domains were 0.42 (0.23) and 0.65 (0.44), respectively. 
Conclusions LIT is moderately responsive to SRI in patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus. Inclusion of this tool in clinical care and clinical trials may 
provide further insights into its responsiveness. This is the first systemic 
lupus erythematosus patient reported outcome tool to be evaluated against 
composite responder index (SRI) used in clinical trials.

Hormonal homeostasis is crucial for keeping a competent and healthy immune 
function. Several hormones can modulate the function of various immune cells 
such as dendritic cells (DCs) by influencing the initiation of the immune 
response and the maintenance of peripheral tolerance to self-antigens. Hormones, 
such as estrogens, prolactin, progesterone and glucocorticoids may profoundly 
affect DCs differentiation, maturation and function leading to either a 
pro-inflammatory or an anti-inflammatory (or tolerogenic) phenotype. If not 
properly regulated, these processes can contribute to the pathogenesis of 
autoimmune disease. An unbalanced hormonal status may affect the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, the expression of activating/inhibitory receptors 
and co-stimulatory molecules on conventional and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), 
conferring susceptibility to develop autoimmunity. Estrogen receptor (ER)-α 
signaling in conventional DCs can promote IFN-α and IL-6 production and induce 
the expression of CD40, CD86 and MHCII molecules. Furthermore, estrogen 
modulates the pDCs response to Toll-like receptor ligands enhancing T cell 
priming. During lupus pathogenesis, ER-α deficiency decreased the expression of 
MHC II on pDCs from the spleen. In contrast, estradiol administration to 
lupus-prone female mice increased the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, 
enhanced the immunogenicity and produced large amounts of IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α 
by bone marrow-derived DCs. These data suggest that estradiol/ER signaling may 
play an active role during lupus pathology. Similarly, understanding hormonal 
modulation of DCs may favor the design of new therapeutic strategies based on 
autologous tolerogenic DCs transfer, especially in sex-biased systemic 
autoimmune diseases. In this review, we discuss recent data relative to the role 
of different hormones (estrogen, prolactin, progesterone and glucocorticoids) in 
DC function during systemic autoimmune pathogenesis.

In this study, we seek to explore alterations of coupling between functional 
connectivity density (FCD) and amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in 
systemic lupus erythematosus patients without overt neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(non-NPSLE) by using resting-state functional MR imaging. This study was 
approved by the institutional ethical review board, and all participants signed 
written informed consent prior to the study. Twenty six non-NPSLE patients and 
35 matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MR imaging. The 
correlation analysis between FCD and ALFF was conducted to assess the imaging 
coupling. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to correlate imaging 
variables to clinical and neuropsychological data in non-NPSLE patients. 
According to the consistent alteration of FCD and ALFF, region of interests were 
identified including the right inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral 
hippocampus-parahippocampus (H-PH), left posterior cingulate cortex, superior 
parietal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and bilateral precuneus. Across-voxel 
correlation analysis showed decreased coupling strengths in some brain regions. 
Correlations between FCD, ALFF, and coupling strength in H-PH and C3/C4/MoCA 
were found. The imaging coupling between FCD and ALFF was decreased in non-NPSLE 
patients, indicating brain function alteration in non-NPSLE patients, especially 
the abnormal coupling between FCD and ALFF of the hippocampus-parahippocampus 
might be an imaging biomarker of brain dysfunction in non-NPSLE patients.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease that 
can affect multiple end organs. Kidney and brain are two of the organs most 
commonly involved in SLE. Past studies have suggested the importance of 
macrophages in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN). Furthermore, as the 
immune effectors of the brain, microglia have been implicated in pathways 
leading to neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). We depleted macrophages and microglia 
using GW2580, a small colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) kinase 
inhibitor, in MRL-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice, a classic murine lupus model that 
displays features of both LN and NPSLE. Treatment was initiated before the onset 
of disease, and mice were followed for the development of LN and neurobehavioral 
dysfunction throughout the study. Treatment with GW2580 significantly 
ameliorated kidney disease, as evidenced by decreased proteinuria, BUN, and 
improved renal histopathology, despite equivalent levels of IgG and C3 
deposition in the kidneys of treated and control mice. We were able to confirm 
macrophage depletion within the kidney via IBA-1 staining. Furthermore, we 
observed specific improvement in the depression-like behavioral deficit of 
MRL/lpr mice with GW2580 treatment. Circulating antibody and autoantibody levels 
were, however, not affected. These results provide additional support for the 
role of macrophages as a potentially valuable therapeutic target in SLE. 
Inhibiting CSF-1 receptor signaling would be more targeted than current 
immunosuppressive therapies, and may hold promise for the treatment of renal and 
neuropsychiatric end organ disease manifestations.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects 
multiple systems. Myelopathy is one of 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes related to 
SLE defined by the American College of Rheumatology. Although infrequent, it is 
a severe manifestation, leading to motor and sensory deficits, and sphincter 
dysfunction. The pathogenesis is not clearly known, but may be related to 
arterial thrombosis and vasculitis. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, 
laboratory tests and the use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. 
The standard therapy is the combination of intravenous cyclophosphamide and 
glucocorticoids. In refractory disease, other treatments such as plasmapheresis 
or rituximab have been used.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the sex ratio among offspring born to women with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is different 
from that in the general population.
METHODS: Women with a singleton delivery were identified from the Swedish 
Medical Birth Register (1973-2012) and linked to the National Patient Register 
(1964-2012) to identify those with prevalent SLE or RA. A sample of general 
population comparators was identified from the Swedish Total Population 
Register. We calculated the percentages of males born to women with SLE, women 
with RA, and women in the general population, as well as the risk ratio (RR) for 
having a male child among first births and all births. We also examined a 
history of antiphospholipid syndrome in the SLE population, using International 
Classification of Disease codes before or at delivery.
RESULTS: We identified 661 women with SLE and 1,136 women with RA before their 
first delivery. There were a total of 1,401 deliveries to women with SLE and a 
total of 2,674 deliveries to women with RA. Compared with women in the general 
population, women with SLE and those with RA had a lower risk of having a 
first-born male (RR 0.92 [95% confidence interval 0.85-1.00] and RR 0.93 [95% 
confidence interval 0.87-0.99], respectively). Among all births, the percentage 
of male offspring remained lower than that in the general population, but the 
difference was not statistically significant for RA.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of male offspring born to women with prevalent SLE or 
RA at delivery was lower than that in the general population, although the 
difference was small. Chronic inflammation may affect the sex ratio through 
fetal loss in early gestation.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the external validity of the Lupus Impact Tracker (LIT), a 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-specific, health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) tool in a population-based cohort of patients with SLE in Atlanta, 
Georgia. We modeled the association of LIT scores with patient-reported measures 
of SLE activity (Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire [SLAQ]) and organ damage 
(self-administered Brief Index of Lupus Damage [SA-BILD]). We investigated the 
association of LIT scores with general HRQoL using the Short Form 12 (SF-12).
METHODS: Correlation, multivariable regression, and longitudinal analyses using 
general linear modeling with fixed effects were performed to investigate the 
association between the LIT and patient-reported disease activity (SLAQ); 
patient-reported disease damage (SA-BILD); mental health (mental component 
summary [MCS] of the SF-12); and physical health (physical component summary 
[PCS] of the SF-12). Demographic trends related to the LIT were also assessed 
using cross-sectional analysis.
RESULTS: The LIT was significantly associated with disease activity (SLAQ), 
organ damage (SA-BILD), MCS scores, and PCS scores in both adjusted and 
unadjusted regression analysis (P < 0.0001). Longitudinal analysis demonstrated 
a significant association between the LIT and disease activity (SLAQ), MCS 
scores, and PCS scores (P < 0.0001), but not organ damage (SA-BILD).
CONCLUSION: The LIT is a simple, patient-centered tool that can be used to 
assess HRQoL in patients with SLE. This study provides external validity of the 
LIT in a population-based cohort with a large number of African American 
patients with a relatively high disease burden.

erythematosus (SLE), with a focus on cardiovascular (CV) diseases.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional multicenter study where the prevalence of 
more relevant comorbidities in 2 cohorts was compared. Patients under followup 
from SJOGRENSER (Spanish Rheumatology Society Registry of Primary SS) and 
RELESSER (Spanish Rheumatology Society Registry of SLE), and who fulfilled the 
2002 American-European Consensus Group and 1997 American College of Rheumatology 
classification criteria, respectively, were included. A binomial logistic 
regression analysis was carried out to explore potential differences, making 
general adjustments for age, sex, and disease duration and specific adjustments 
for each variable, including CV risk factors and treatments, when appropriate.
RESULTS: A total of 437 primary SS patients (95% female) and 2,926 SLE patients 
(89% female) were included. The mean age was 58.6 years (interquartile range 
[IQR] 50.0-69.9 years) for primary SS patients and 45.1 years (IQR 36.4-56.3 
years) for SLE patients (P < 0.001), and disease duration was 10.4 years (IQR 
6.0-16.7 years) and 13.0 years (IQR 7.45-19.76 years), respectively (P < 0.001). 
Smoking, dyslipidemia, and arterial hypertension were associated less frequently 
with primary SS (odds ratio [OR] 0.36 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
0.28-0.48], 0.74 [95% CI 0.58-0.94], and 0.50 [95% CI 0.38-0.66], respectively) 
as were life-threatening CV events (i.e., stroke or myocardial infarction; OR 
0.57 [95% CI 0.35-0.92]). Conversely, lymphoma was associated more frequently 
with primary SS (OR 4.41 [95% CI 1.35-14.43]). The prevalence of severe 
infection was lower in primary SS than in SLE (10.1% versus 16.9%; OR 0.54 [95% 
CI 0.39-0.76]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Primary SS patients have a consistently less serious CV comorbidity 
burden and a lower prevalence of severe infection than those with SLE. In 
contrast, their risk of lymphoma is greater.

INTRODUCTION: Remission is the ultimate goal in systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE). In this study, we applied four definitions of remission agreed on by an 
international collaboration (Definitions of Remission in SLE, DORIS) to a large 
clinical cohort to estimate rates and predictors of remission.
METHODS: We applied the DORIS definitions of Clinical Remission, Complete 
Remission (requiring negative serologies), Clinical Remission on treatment (ROT) 
and Complete ROT. 2307 patients entered the cohort from 1987 to 2014 and were 
seen at least quarterly. Patients not in remission at cohort entry were followed 
prospectively. We used the Kaplan-Meier approach to estimate the time to 
remission and the time from remission to relapse. Cox regression was used to 
identify baseline factors associated with time to remission, adjusting for 
baseline disease activity and baseline treatment.
RESULTS: The median time to remission was 8.7, 11.0, 1.8 and 3.1 years for 
Clinical Remission, Complete Remission, Clinical ROT and Complete ROT, 
respectively. High baseline treatment was the major predictor of a longer time 
to remission, followed by high baseline activity. The median duration of 
remission for all definitions was 3 months. African-American ethnicity, baseline 
low C3 and baseline haematological activity were associated with longer time to 
remission for all definitions. Baseline anti-dsDNA and baseline low C4 were 
associated with longer time to Complete Remission and Complete ROT. Baseline low 
C4 was also negatively associated with Clinical Remission.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide further insights into the frequency and 
duration of remission in SLE and call attention to the major role of baseline 
activity and baseline treatment in predicting remission.

Objective The objective of this study was to determine the association of 
disease expression patterns with demographic and clinical characteristics in 
SLE. Methods Patients from a multi-ethnic SLE cohort were included. Disease 
expression patterns were defined as acute SLE and insidious SLE; this group was 
divided into those who accrued three ACR criteria and then accrued the fourth 
(insidious pattern A) and those who have one or two and then accrued four 
criteria (insidious pattern B). Disease activity was ascertained with the SLAM-R 
and disease damage with SLICC/ACR damage index. Variables were compared using 
analysis of variance for numeric variables and χ2 for categorical variables. 
Multivariable analyses adjusting for possible confounders were performed. 
Results Six hundred and forty patients were included; the most frequent pattern 
was the insidious pattern B, with 415 (64.8%) patients, followed by the acute 
SLE group with 115 (18.0%) and the insidious pattern A with 110 (17.2%) 
patients. Patients from the insidious pattern A were older at diagnosis (pattern 
A: 39.8 vs pattern B: 36.7 vs acute: 32.4 years; p < 0.0001), more educated 
(13.6 vs 13.1 vs 12.1; p = 0.0008) and with a less active disease at baseline 
(8.8 vs 9.2 vs 10.7; p = 0.0227). Caucasian and Hispanic (Puerto Rico) 
ethnicities were overrepresented in this group (40.0% vs 27.7% vs 19.1% and 
18.2% vs 17.1% vs 9.6%; p = 0.0003). Conclusions More insidious onset is 
associated with older age, Caucasian ethnicity, higher level of education, and 
lower disease activity than those with acute onset. However, after multivariable 
analyses, disease activity was not associated with any disease expression 
pattern.

The aim of this study was to compare the frequency and severity of chronic 
periodontitis (CP) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with 
individuals without rheumatic diseases. Seventy-five patients with SLE were 
compared to 75 individuals without rheumatic diseases (control group) matched 
for age, educational level, and income. The activity of SLE was assessed with 
the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000. Systemic Lupus 
International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage 
Index for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus evaluated SLE-related damage. Dental 
evaluation included measuring plaque index and parameters of periodontal disease 
(probing depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing). Fifty-one 
(68 %) SLE patients and 42 (56 %) control individuals had CP (p = 0.13). 
Periodontal status was similar in both groups. Considering only individuals with 
CP, SLE patients were younger than controls (40.7 ± 9.8 versus 
46.14 ± 12.5 years of age, p = 0.02). CP was not associated with activity or 
therapeutics in SLE patients. Severity of periodontal parameters was similar in 
SLE patients and control subjects; however, CP occurred earlier in SLE patients.

BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of apoptosis has an important role in the induction of 
autoimmunity.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of keratinocyte apoptosis and 
deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) activity on the clinical and immunoserological 
parameters of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).
METHODS: We studied 69 CLE patients (39 with discoid LE (DLE), 12 with subacute 
CLE (SCLE), 12 with acute and 6 with intermittent CLE). Thirty of sixty-nine 
patients fulfilled criteria for systemic LE (SLE). Apoptotic index (AI) was 
evaluated immunohistochemically in lesional and non-lesional, photoprotected 
skin. Serum DNase I activity, antichromatin and anti-ENA antibodies were 
measured by ELISA. Disease activity was determined by SLEDAI-2K, SLICC/ACR, 
CLASI and RCLASI.
RESULTS: AI in lesions was higher than in non-lesional skin (P < 0.001). There 
was no difference in AI between CLE and SLE patients. Patients with SCLE had 
higher lesional AI than patients with DLE (P < 0.05). We found a positive 
correlation between the lesional AI with CLASI A (P < 0.05) and RCLASI D (P < 
0.05). CLE and SLE patients had significantly lower DNase I activity than 
healthy controls (P < 0.001). Patients with normal DNase I activity and low AI 
had significantly lower CLASI A than patients with decreased DNase I activity 
and/or elevated AI (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased keratinocyte apoptosis characterizes lesions of all CLE 
forms, especially of SCLE. AI correlates with CLE markers of acute and chronic 
inflammation. Normal level of apoptosis and DNase I activity simultaneously 
reduce the level of acute inflammation in CLE. Serum DNase I activity and AI 
might be important biomarkers in the evaluation of CLE patients.

Long-term inflammatory processes directed at a particular endogenous or 
exogenous antigen, or sometimes of unknown etiology, form the pathogenetic basis 
for many debilitating conditions, such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, autoimmune, 
neurologic diseases, and cancer. Recent discoveries of neuroimmune semaphorins 
4A and 4D (Sema4A and Sema4D, respectively) expression and function in the 
immune system and their key regulatory roles in fine tuning of inflammatory 
processes made them the molecules of interest for a potential immunotherapy. In 
this short review, we discuss the current knowledge in the Sema4A and Sema4D 
actions in chronic inflammation underlying the outlined above diseases.

It's like a black woman's Charlie Brown moment: An autoethnography of being

Ferdinand R(1).

Author information:
(1)New York City College of Technology, USA.

This essay uses autoethnography to relate the experience of being diagnosed with 
lupus. By using my personal experiences and a discussion of illness and Black 
women's health, I critically examine larger critical race issues of race, 
gender, and the social barriers to health care. Specifically, the essay focuses 
on the ways in which race impacts my experiences with the healthcare system, 
from my own insecurities of being stereotyped to the ways that doctors interact 
with me. The essay is framed by popular quotes from Charlie Brown because they 
help mediate the very personal experiences I am recounting.

Basement membranes are formed from condensed networks of extracellular matrix 
(ECM) proteins. These structures underlie all epithelial, mesothelial and 
endothelial sheets and provide an essential structural scaffold. Candidate-based 
investigations have established that predominant components of basement 
membranes are laminins, collagen type IV, nidogens and heparan sulphate 
proteoglycans. More recently, global proteomic approaches have been applied to 
investigate ECM and these analyses confirm tissue-specific ECM proteomes with a 
high degree of complexity. The proteomes consist of structural as well as 
regulatory ECM proteins such as proteases and growth factors. This review is 
focused on the proteomic analysis of basement membranes and illustrates how this 
approach can be used to build our understanding of ECM regulation in health and 
disease.

PURPOSE: To describe a patient with undiagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus and 
secondary antiphospholipid syndrome presenting with bilateral severe retinal 
vaso-occlusion on first presentation.
METHODS: Retrospective case report. A 42-year-old Hispanic female with no 
medical history presented with 2 weeks of bilateral decreased vision.
RESULTS: At initial presentation, the patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 
2 ft/200 and 20/400 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Dilated fundus 
examination revealed diffuse, confluent cotton-wool spots, and severe vascular 
occlusions in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography confirmed that the patient had 
both arterial and venous vascular occlusions and retinal vasculitis. A thorough 
work-up revealed that the patient had systemic lupus erythematosus and APS with 
positive antibodies to anticardiolipin, beta-2-glycoprotein, and lupus 
anticoagulant. The patient was treated with steroids, immunosuppression agents, 
anticoagulation, and extensive panretinal photocoagulation. One month later, 
best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/200 and 20/40, the vasculitis 
had substantially improved, and no neovascularization was present.
CONCLUSION: Severe retinal vaso-occlusion may be the first presenting signs for 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and APS.

OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence indicates that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) exerts 
vasculoprotective activities by promoting activating transcription factor 3 
(ATF3), leading to downregulation of toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced 
inflammatory responses. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with 
increased cardiovascular disease risk not explained by the Framingham risk 
score. Recent studies have indicated oxidised HDL as a possible contributor. We 
investigated the potential mechanisms by which lupus HDL may lose its 
anti-inflammatory effects and promote immune dysregulation.
METHODS: Control macrophages were challenged with control and SLE HDL in vitro 
and examined for inflammatory markers by real-time qRT-PCR, confocal microscopy, 
ELISA and flow cytometry. Lupus-prone mice were treated with an HDL mimetic 
(ETC-642) in vivo and inflammatory cytokine levels measured by real-time qRT-PCR 
and ELISA.
RESULTS: Compared with control HDL, SLE HDL activates NFκB, promotes 
inflammatory cytokine production and fails to block TLR-induced inflammation in 
control macrophages. This failure of lupus HDL to block inflammatory responses 
is due to an impaired ability to promote ATF3 synthesis and nuclear 
translocation. This inflammation is dependent on lectin-like oxidised 
low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX1R) binding and rho-associated, 
coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 and 2 (ROCK1/2) kinase activity. HDL 
mimetic-treated lupus mice showed significant ATF3 induction and proinflammatory 
cytokine abrogation.
CONCLUSIONS: Lupus HDL promotes proinflammatory responses through NFκB 
activation and decreased ATF3 synthesis and activity in an LOX1R-dependent and 
ROCK1/2-dependent manner. HDL mimetics should be explored as potential therapies 
for inflammation and SLE cardiovascular risk.

Background Mycophenolate mofetil has recently been reported to be effective 
against systemic lupus erythematosus. The influence of the pharmacokinetics of 
mycophenolic acid, the active form of mycophenolate mofetil and the major 
inactive mycophenolic acid phenolic glucuronide on the activity of the target 
enzyme inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, is expected to be revealed. The 
aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with inosine 
5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity in systemic lupus erythematosus 
patients. Methods Fifty systemic lupus erythematosus patients in remission 
maintenance phase (29 received mycophenolate mofetil [MMF+] and 21 did not 
[MMF-]) were enrolled. Median and interquartile range of dose of mycophenolate 
mofetil were 1500 and 1000-1500 mg/day, respectively. Stepwise multiple linear 
regression analysis was performed to assess the dependence between inosine 
5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity and 25 predictor values including 
predose plasma concentrations of free mycophenolic acid and mycophenolic acid 
phenolic glucuronide. Results Median and interquartile range of predose total 
plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid and mycophenolic acid phenolic 
glucuronide were 2.73 and 1.43-5.73 and 25.5 and 13.1-54.7  µg/mL, respectively. 
Predose inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher 
in MMF+ than MMF- patients (median 38.3 and 20.6 nmoL xanthosine 
5'-monophosphate/g haemoglobin/h, P<0.01). The plasma concentration of free 
mycophenolic acid phenolic glucuronide, complement fraction C3 and body weight 
were significant predictors accounting for interindividual variability in the 
inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity (adjusted R2 = 0.52, P < 0.01) 
in a multivariate analysis. Conclusions Predose inosine 5'-monophosphate 
dehydrogenase activity was higher in systemic lupus erythematosus patients 
receiving mycophenolate mofetil therapy. Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 
activity may be determined by mycophenolic acid exposure and complement fraction 
C3 in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.

Lupus disease and its complications including lupus nephritis (LN) are very 
disabling and significantly impact the quality of life and longevity of 
patients. Broadly immunosuppressive treatments do not always provide the 
expected clinical benefits and have significant side effects that contribute to 
patient morbidity. In the era of systems biology, new strategies are being 
deployed integrating diverse sources of information (molecular and clinical) so 
as to identify individual disease specificities and select less aggressive 
treatments. In this review, we summarize integrative approaches linking 
molecular disease profiles (mainly tissue transcriptomics) and clinical 
phenotypes. The main goals are to better understand the pathogenesis of lupus 
nephritis, to identify the risk factors for renal flare and to find the 
predictors of both short and long-term clinical outcome. Identification of 
common key drivers and additional patient-specific key drivers can open the door 
to improved and individualized therapy to prevent and treat LN.

INTRODUCTION: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an inflammatory autoimmune 
disease where an interplay between acute phase proteins and cytokines are 
involved in disease activation.
AIM AND OBJECTIVES: This case control study was performed to investigate 
interrelationship between high sensitivity C-reactive proteins (hs-CRP), 
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and disease activity among SLE patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty one clinically diagnosed SLE cases were 
included and disease activity was noted by SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). 
Serum IL-6 levels were measure by cytokine multiplex assay. Serum hs-CRP, C3 and 
C4 levels were measure by nephelometer. The Pearson correlation test was used 
for correlation between hs-CRP, Il-6 and SLEDAI.
RESULTS: Based on SLEDAI, 126 patients (89.4 %) had active disease and 15 
patients (10.6%) had inactive disease. Mean hs-CRP levels in SLE patients were 
significantly higher (12.1+ 11.5 mg/L) than controls (2.41+ 1.37 mg/L) (P < 
0.0001). Hs-CRP levels among active SLE were significantly higher (13.5+ 11.4 
mg/L) as compared with inactive SLE (4.4 + 2.9 mg/L) (P=0.0002). Similarly, IL-6 
levels in SLE patients were significantly higher among active SLE (26.9 + 15.5 
pg/ml) as compared with inactive SLE (13.9+ 10.2 pg/ml) (P=0.0001). An inverse 
correlation between Il-6 and hemoglobin levels between active and inactive SLE 
was noted (r=-0.46, P <0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests a good correlation between hs-CRP, IL-6 and SLE 
disease activity indicating their direct involvement in inflammatory conditions 
associated with disease.

Primary care and chronic disease: the intersection of comfort and specialty 
involvement - a cross-sectional study.

BACKGROUND: Primary care referrals to specialty physicians play an integral role 
in patient care and health care costs. Multiple factors play into the primary 
care physician's decision to refer, including comfort managing particular 
conditions. As the burden of chronic disease climbs, the relationship between 
patients, primary care physicians and specialists in accurately diagnosing, 
managing and treating chronic conditions needs clarity. The objective of this 
study is to assess the relationship between specialty physician involvement and 
the care of three chronic conditions: diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: To achieve this objective, we performed a cross-sectional study of 2013 
MarketScan data (875 million billing records) for three chronic medical 
conditions. Participants were identified in the dataset by having received a 
diagnosis code for DM, CKD or SLE in an outpatient care setting during 2013. The 
study compared proportions of outpatient visits with specialty physicians in 
endocrinology, nephrology and rheumatology for patients with DM, CKD and SLE 
respectively.
RESULTS: Data included 1 615 609 visits with the diagnosis of DM, 158 424 visits 
with the diagnosis of CKD and 103 910 visits with SLE. Diabetic patients met 
endocrinologists (10.2%) at a smaller proportion of their visits than patients 
with CKD saw nephrologists (41.2%, P < 0.0001). Further, CKD patients met with 
nephrologists (41.2%) at a significantly fewer proportion of outpatient visits 
than SLE patients saw rheumatologists (51.8%, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in primary care physicians' comfort with diagnosis, 
therapy and adherence to published guidelines affect the rate with which primary 
care providers seek specialty consultation.

Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are often treated with 
glucocorticoids, which place them at risk of bone loss. Objectives The 
objectives of this article are to determine: (1) the prevalence of low bone 
mineral density (BMD) and factors associated with low BMD and (2) the prevalence 
of symptomatic fragility fractures in inception patients of the Toronto Lupus 
Cohort (TLC). Methods Prospectively collected data from the TLC (1996-2015) of 
inception patients' first BMD were analyzed. For pre-menopausal women/males <50 
years, BMD 'below expected range for age' was defined by Z-score ≤ -2.0 SD. For 
post-menopausal women/males age 50 or older, osteoporosis was defined by 
T-score ≤ -2.5 SD and low bone mass by T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD. 
Patients' BMDs were defined as abnormal if Z-score ≤ -2.0 or T-score < -1.0 SD, 
and the remainder as normal. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were 
employed. Results Of 1807 patients, 286 are inception patients with BMD results 
(mean age 37.9 ± 13.7 years); 88.8% are female. The overall prevalence of 
abnormal BMD is 31.5%. In pre-menopausal women ( n = 173), the prevalence of BMD 
below expected range is 17.3%. In post-menopausal women ( n = 81), the 
prevalence of osteoporosis and low BMD are 12.3% and 43.2%, respectively. Age 
and cumulative dose of glucocorticoids are statistically significantly 
associated with abnormal BMD in multivariate analysis. Of 769 inception patients 
from TLC, 11.1% experienced symptomatic fragility fractures (peripheral and 
vertebral) over the course of their disease. Conclusion The prevalence of low 
BMD is high in SLE patients, and is associated with older age and higher 
cumulative glucocorticoid dose.

Objective Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory 
autoimmune disease. However, the exact mechanism underlying SLE-related 
osteopenia and osteoporosis in patients newly diagnosed with SLE remains 
unknown. Methods 60 male subjects with SLE aged 20-30 years were enrolled. Serum 
osteocalcin was examined as a marker of bone formation and type I collagen 
degradation products (β-crosslaps) as markers of bone resorption. Lumbar spine 
(L1-L4) and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) were determined by dual energy 
X-ray absorption (DXA). Results Among the 60 subjects with SLE at the time of 
diagnosis, the cohort showed a significant reduction of osteocalcin 
(12.62 ± 2.16 ng/mL), and serum β-crosslaps level (992.6 ± 162.6 pg/mL) was 
markedly elevated. Univariate correlation analyses revealed negative 
correlations between osteocalcin and SLEDAI, dsDNA antibody and β-crosslaps. A 
positive correlation was also observed between osteocalcin and C3, C4, 25-OH 
vitamin D, BMD L1-L4 and BMD total hip (see Table 3). Osteocalcin and 
β-crosslaps were strongly associated with SLE disease activity by multiple 
stepwise logistic regression analysis. Conclusion Osteocalcin was negatively 
associated with SLE disease activity, and β-crosslaps was positively associated 
with SLE disease activity, suggesting SLE disease activity itself directly 
contributed to the development of SLE-associated osteopenia and osteoporosis.

We performed a retrospective study of all systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
pregnancies during a 10-year period (2006-2015) to describe the clinical 
features, maternal and foetal outcomes in our centre. There were 115 pregnancies 
in 86 women with SLE. Our patients had a mean age of 29.1 years (SD 5.80) and a 
mean disease duration of 44.63 months (SD 41.17). Fifteen patients had 
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Our patients had complicated pregnancies: 26.1% 
had SLE flares, 13.9% had pre-eclampsia and 45.1% needed caesarean sections. 
There were 23.3% foetal losses and 25% preterm deliveries in our patients. There 
was a higher rate of unplanned pregnancies and lupus flare among pregnancies 
with active SLE at conception. Pregnancies in lupus nephritis have higher 
incidence of lupus flares during pregnancy but similar maternal and foetal 
outcomes compared to those without nephritis. The prognostic indicators for 
adverse foetal outcome in our patients were flare of SLE (HR 4.08 [CI 95% 
1.65-10.13, p < 0.01]) and APS (HR 3.07 [CI 95% 1.12-8.42, p < 0.05]) and the 
prognostic indicator for adverse maternal outcome was hypertension (HR 3.58 [CI 
95% 1.30-9.90, p < 0.05]). Lupus pregnancies in our centre remained as high-risk 
pregnancies with significant maternal and foetal complications.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article is to validate the Lupus Impact 
Tracker (LIT), a disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) tool, in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients in a multi-ethnic Australian cohort.
METHODS: Patients attending the Monash Lupus Clinic were asked to complete the 
LIT, a 10-item PRO. Psychometric testing assessing criterion validity, construct 
validity, test-retest reliability (TRT) and internal consistency reliability 
(ICR) were performed. We compared the LIT scores across patient characteristics, 
and correlations between LIT scores and SLEDAI-2k, PGA, and SLICC-SDI were 
examined.
RESULTS: LIT data were obtained from 73 patients. Patients were 84% female with 
a median age of 41 years, and 34% were Asian. The cohort had mild-moderate 
disease activity with a median (IQR) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease 
Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2k) of 4 (IQR 2-6). The median LIT score was 32.5 
(IQR 17.5-50). LIT demonstrated criterion validity against SLEDAI-2k and SDI. 
Construct validity assessed by confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated an 
excellent fit (Goodness of fit index 0.95, Comparative Fit Index 1, Root Mean 
Square Error of Approximation <0.0001). The LIT demonstrated TRT with an overall 
intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.986 (95% CI 0.968-0.995). ICR was 
demonstrated with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.838. Patients with disability, low 
socioeconomic status, or higher disease activity had significantly worse LIT 
scores.
CONCLUSION: The LIT demonstrated properties consistent with its being valid in 
this population. Lower socioeconomic status appears to have a significant impact 
on patient-reported health-related quality of life in SLE.

Cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of calcineurin, exerts an immunomodulator action 
interfering with T cell activation. Even though novel therapeutic tools have 
emerged, CyA still represents a suitable option in several clinical rheumatology 
settings. This is the case of refractory nephritis and cytopenias associated 
with systemic lupus erythematosus. Furthermore, CyA is a valued therapeutic tool 
in the management of uveitis and thrombophlebitis in course of Behçet's disease. 
Topical CyA has been proven to be beneficial in the dry eye of Sjogren's 
syndrome, whereas oral treatment with CyA can be considered for the severe 
complications of adult onset Still's disease. CyA provides a therapeutic option 
in psoriatic arthritis, being rather effective in skin disease. CyA is currently 
regarded as a second-line option for patients with inflammatory myopathies 
refractory to standard regimen. CyA is used even in paediatric rheumatology, in 
particular in the management of juvenile dermatomyositis and macrophage 
activation syndrome associated with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. 
Importantly, CyA has been shown to suppress the replication of HCV, and it can 
thus be safely prescribed to those patients with chronic hepatitis C. 
Noteworthy, CyA can be administered throughout the gestation course. Surely, 
caution should be paid to CyA safety profile, in particular to its 
nephrotoxicity. Even though most evidence comes from small and uncontrolled 
studies with few randomised controlled trials, CyA should be still regarded as a 
valid therapeutic tool in 2016 rheumatology.

Objective A task force of scientists at the International Congress on 
Antiphospholipid Antibodies recognized that phosphatidylserine-dependent 
antiprothrombin antibodies (aPS/PT) might contribute to a better identification 
of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Accordingly, initial and replication 
retrospective, cross-sectional multicentre studies were conducted to ascertain 
the value of aPS/PT for APS diagnosis. Methods In the initial study (eight 
centres, seven countries), clinical/laboratory data were retrospectively 
collected. Serum/plasma samples were tested for IgG aPS/PT at Inova Diagnostics 
(Inova) using two ELISA kits. A replication study (five centres, five countries) 
was carried out afterwards. Results In the initial study ( n = 247), a moderate 
agreement between the IgG aPS/PT Inova and MBL ELISA kits was observed ( 
k = 0.598). IgG aPS/PT were more prevalent in APS patients (51%) than in those 
without (9%), OR 10.8, 95% CI (4.0-29.3), p < 0.0001. Sensitivity, specificity, 
positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratio of IgG aPS/PT for APS 
diagnosis were 51%, 91%, 5.9 and 0.5, respectively. In the replication study ( 
n = 214), a moderate/substantial agreement between the IgG aPS/PT results 
obtained with both ELISA kits was observed ( k = 0.630). IgG aPS/PT were more 
prevalent in APS patients (47%) than in those without (12%), OR 6.4, 95% CI 
(2.6-16), p < 0.0001. Sensitivity, specificity, LR + and LR- for APS diagnosis 
were 47%, 88%, 3.9 and 0.6, respectively. Conclusions IgG aPS/PT detection is an 
easily performed laboratory parameter that might contribute to a better and more 
complete identification of patients with APS.

Objective The objective of this article is to describe and compare clinical 
features, treatment, and renal outcomes of children with membranous lupus 
nephritis (MLN), through analysis of a national multicenter registry. Methods 
Patients with pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and MLN from the 
Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Legacy Registry 
were included. Demographic, disease and medication-related data were collected 
between 2010 and 2014 from 59 CARRA Legacy Registry sites. Results A total of 
132 individuals had MLN, either in isolation or in combination with 
proliferative LN. Seventy-four patients had pure MLN. The proportion of patients 
with daily corticosteroid treatment was similar among groups (96%, 91%, and 96%, 
for class III+V, IV+V, and V, respectively, p = 0.67). Proportion of individuals 
exposed to any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or biologic was 
similar among the three groups (83%, 91%, 95% for class III+V, IV+V, and V, 
respectively, p = 0.189). Proportion of patients with decreased glomerular 
filtration rate (less than 90 ml/min/1.73 m2) was significantly different among 
groups (4%, 38%, and 4%, for class III+V, IV+V, and V, respectively, 
p < 0.0001). Conclusion This is the largest reported cohort of children with 
MLN. More research is needed to understand treatment practices for pediatric 
MLN, particularly decisions related to pharmacologic treatment of pure MLN. More 
work is also needed to identify prognostic factors and predictors of outcome for 
pediatric MLN. Future observational studies will be a first step toward 
understanding and formulating a standardized approach to treatment of pediatric 
membranous LN and allowing for the initiation of prospective comparative 
effectiveness studies and interventional trials.

Objectives Statins have been proposed as a potential treatment for systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) due to their immunomodulatory properties, their role 
restoring endothelial function and preventing atherosclerosis. We evaluate the 
effect of a short period treatment with a low dose of atorvastatin and its 
withdrawal on early stage subclinical atherosclerosis. Methods Thirty-seven SLE 
females received 20 mg/day atorvastatin during eight weeks. At baseline, at the 
end of treatment and six months after atorvastatin withdrawal, disease activity, 
subclinical atherosclerosis -assessed by measuring carotid-femoral pulse wave 
velocity (PWV) - and quantification of circulating endothelial progenitor cells 
(EPC) - as a surrogate biological marker of subclinical atherosclerosis - were 
carried out. Results The group of SLE patients with baseline pathological 
arterial stiffness showed a significant decrease of PWV after atorvastatin 
therapy (8.43 ± 1.45 m/s vs 7.42 ± 1.06 m/s; p = 0.002) that is maintained six 
months after treatment finished. Only patients of the middle-aged group showed a 
nearly significant decrease in the PWV measured along the study (7.16 ± 1.23 m/s 
vs 6.76 ± 0.82 m/s; p = 0.05). Atorvastatin induced a significant decrease in 
the circulating EPC percentage (0.65 ± 0.67 vs 0.40 ± 0.31; p = 0.023) as well 
as a downward trend of disease activity that it is observed by a decrease in SLE 
disease activity index simultaneously with an increase in C3 complement and 
significant decrease in serum concentration of vascular endothelial grow factor 
(VEGF) and sVCAM-1. Conclusions Short-term atorvastatin therapy reduces arterial 
stiffness of SLE patients with baseline pathological PWV, who are mainly in the 
group of middle-aged patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether 
these patients would benefit from statin therapy in preventing cardiovascular 
events.

Objective We aimed to evaluate the relationship between telomere length and 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods PUBMED and EMBASE databases were 
searched; meta-analyses were performed comparing telomere length in SLE patients 
and healthy controls, and on SLE patients in subgroups based on ethnicity, 
sample type, assay method and data type. Results Eight studies including 472 SLE 
patients and 365 controls were ultimately selected which showed that telomere 
length was significantly shorter in the SLE group than in the control group 
(standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.835, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = -1.291 to -0.380, p = 3.3 × 10-4). Stratification by ethnicity showed 
significantly shortened telomere length in the SLE group in Caucasian, Asian and 
mixed populations (SMD = -0.455, 95% CI = -0.763 to -0.147, p = 0.004; 
SMD = -0.887, 95% CI = -1.261 to -0.513, p = 3.4 × 10-4; SMD = -0.535, 95% 
CI = -0.923 to -0.147, p = 0.007; respectively). Furthermore, telomere length 
was significantly shorter in the SLE group than in the control group in whole 
blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell groups (SMD = -0.361, 95% 
CI = -0.553 to -0.169, p = 2.3 × 10-4; SMD = -1.546, 95% CI = -2.583 to -0.510, 
p = 0.003; respectively); a similar trend was observed in leukocyte groups 
(SMD = -0.699, 95% CI = -1.511 to -0.114, p = 0.092). Meta-analyses based on 
assay method or data type revealed similar associations. Conclusions Our 
meta-analysis demonstrated that telomere length was significantly shorter in 
patients with SLE, regardless of ethnicity, sample type or assay method 
evaluated.

The causal link between inherited complement deficiencies and systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) has been well established, although it remains a rare cause 
of the disease. We present the case of three biological sisters with hereditary 
heterozygous C2 deficiency, but who differ widely in their clinical and 
serological manifestations. Patient 1 is 25 years old and was diagnosed with SLE 
at the age of 12. Further testing revealed positive ANA and anti-dsDNA, 
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and decreased C2, C3 and C4 levels. Patients 2 
and 3 are 21-year-old dizygotic twins. Both have positive ANA and 
antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies, and decreased C2 and C4 levels. We present a 
case of familial heterozygous C2 deficiency with different disease phenotypes. 
The presence of positive APL antibodies in all 3 patients is significant, as 
this association has been rarely described. The variable clinical and 
serological manifestations among our patients further reflect the complex and 
multifactorial nature of SLE.

SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a breakdown of 
tolerance to nuclear antigens and generation of high-affinity pathogenic 
autoantibodies. These autoantibodies form, with autoantigens, immune complexes 
that are involved in organ and tissue damages. Understanding how the production 
of these pathogenic autoantibodies arises is of prime importance. T follicular 
helper cells (Tfh) and IL-21 have emerged as central players in this process. 
This article reviews the pathogenic role of Tfh cells and IL-21 in SLE.

Lupus nephritis (LN), a potentially destructive outcome of SLE, is a real 
challenge in the management of SLE because of the difficulty in diagnosing its 
subclinical onset and identifying relapses before serious complications set in. 
Conventional clinical parameters such as proteinuria, GFR, urine sediments, 
anti-dsDNA and complement levels are not sensitive or specific enough for 
detecting ongoing disease activity in lupus kidneys and early relapse of 
nephritis. There has long been a need for biomarkers of disease activity in LN. 
Such markers ideally should be capable of predicting early sub-clinical flares 
and could be used to gauge response to therapy, thus obviating the need for 
serial renal biopsies with their possible hazardous complications. Since urine 
can be readily obtained, it lends itself as an obvious biological substrate. In 
this review, the use of urine and serum as sources of lupus nephritis biomarkers 
is described, and the results of biomarker discovery studies using candidate and 
proteomic approaches are summarized.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with high female 
predominance in reproductive years. It is characterized by a pronounced 
inflammation and production of a variety of autoantibodies. SLE pathogenesis is 
influenced by genes, hormones and environmental agents. The aim of this study 
was assess the possible effect of environmental pesticide mixtures in SLE 
patients. Oxidative DNA damage was measured using the comet assay modified by 
enzyme Endo III for detection of oxidized bases (Endo Sites), and oxidative 
stress by the measurement of the activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation (TBARS). Eighty-nine patients with 
diagnosis of SLE were included, 46% of them came from areas highly sprayed with 
pesticides and were compared with patients from urban areas with the same 
clinical and socio-demographic characteristics (p≥0.155). In order to identify 
factors that could predict DNA damage and oxidative stress, a binary logistic 
regression model with independent variables was developed: place of residence 
(p=0.007) have 75% of positive predictive value while smoking habit (p=0.186) 
have a 56% negative predictive value. The Odd Ratio (OR) obtained indicate that 
lupus patients living in rural areas presented 3.52 times more oxidative DNA 
damage compared to those living in the city. The prospects of applying 
biomarkers to assess exposure and biological effects, such as DNA damage and 
oxidative stress in autoimmune diseases, allow improving the characterization of 
individual risk.

Previously, we described associations between health-related quality of life 
(HRQOL) and disease-related factors among childhood onset systemic lupus 
erythematosus (cSLE) patients. Here we determined the relationship between 
HRQOL, disease activity and damage in a large prospective international cohort 
of cSLE. We compared HRQOL, disease activity and disease damage across different 
continents and examined the relationship between children's and parents' 
assessments of HRQOL. Patients with cSLE and their parents completed HRQOL 
measures at enrollment and ≥4 follow-up visits. Physicians assessed disease 
activity and damage. The multinational cohort ( n = 467) had relatively low 
disease activity and damage. Patient and parent HRQOL scores were significantly 
correlated. Asian and European patients had the highest HRQOL, while South and 
North American patients had lower HRQOL scores. Renal, CNS, skin and 
musculoskeletal systems exhibited the highest levels of damage. North and South 
American and Asian patients were more likely to have disease damage and activity 
scores above median values, compared with Europeans. Asians were more likely to 
use cyclophosphamide/rituximab. Female gender, high disease activity and damage, 
non-White ethnicity, and use of cyclophosphamide and/rituximab were related to 
lower HRQOL. HRQOL domain scores continue to emphasize that SLE has widespread 
impact on all aspects of children's and parents' lives.

Background Musculoskeletal involvement is extremely common in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Continuing the research initiated in 
patients with inflammatory arthritis, recent studies have shown the potential 
role of musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) in the evaluation of clinical and 
subclinical lupus synovitis. The inflammatory process in SLE is traditionally 
considered to be localized at synovial tissue areas while enthesis is not 
included among the possible targets of the disease. Patients and methods 
Entheses included in the Glasgow Ultrasound Enthesitis Scoring System were 
scanned in a cohort of 20 SLE patients serving as disease controls in an MSUS 
study aimed at assessing enthesitis in patients with psoriatic arthritis. We 
describe in detail four cases with unexpected and unequivocal expressions of 
MSUS enthesitis according to the OMERACT definition. Three out of four patients 
had no predisposing factors for enthesopathy. Case no. 2 was treated with a 
variable-dose prednisone regimen. Results In the four cases MSUS examination 
revealed relevant grey-scale and power Doppler abnormalities at the entheseal 
level, most commonly at the distal insertion of the patellar tendon. Signs of 
clinical enthesitis were detected in only one patient. Conclusions This case 
series shows for the first time the presence of clearly evident MSUS findings 
indicative of enthesitis in four out of 20 SLE patients (20%), raising the 
hypothesis that enthesis could be a missing target in the clinical evaluation of 
SLE patients. Our case series justifies further investigations for a better 
evaluation of the prevalence, characteristics and clinical relevance of 
entheseal involvement in SLE.

Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a life-threatening multisystem 
autoimmune disease that is more severe in patients of African ancestry and 
children, yet pediatric SLE on the African continent has been understudied. This 
study describes a cohort of pediatric SLE (PULSE) patients in South Africa. 
Methods Patients with a diagnosis of SLE (1997 American College of Rheumatology 
criteria) diagnosed prior to age 19 years in Cape Town, South Africa, were 
enrolled in this cross-sectional study from September 2013 to December 2014. 
Information on clinical and serological characteristics was extracted from 
medical records. Results were compared to a well-described North American 
pediatric SLE cohort. Results Seventy-two South African patients were enrolled 
in the study; mean age 11.5 years; 82% were girls. The racial distribution was 
68% Coloured, 24% Black, 5% White and 3% Asian/Indian. Most patients presented 
with severe lupus nephritis documented by renal biopsy (61%). Of patients with 
lupus nephritis, 63% presented with International Society of Nephrology/Renal 
Pathology Society class III or IV. Patients in the PULSE cohort were more likely 
to be treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and azathioprine. The PULSE 
cohort had high disease activity at diagnosis (mean Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K) 20.6). The SLEDAI-2K at enrolment in the 
PULSE cohort (5.0) did not differ from the North American pediatric SLE cohort 
(4.8). Sixty-three per cent of the PULSE cohort had end organ damage with 
Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index (SLICC-DI) score 
>0 (mean SLICC-DI 1.9), compared to 23% in a previously reported US cohort. 
Within the PULSE cohort, nine (13%) developed end-stage renal disease with six 
(8%) requiring transplant, strikingly higher than North American peers 
(transplant rate <1%). Conclusions The PULSE cohort had highly active multiorgan 
disease at diagnosis and significant disease damage at enrolment in the South 
African registry. South African patients have severe lupus nephritis and poor 
renal outcomes compared to North American peers. Our study revealed a severe 
disease phenotype in the PULSE cohort resulting in poor outcomes in this 
high-risk population.

Nematode infections have been observed to inversely correlate with autoimmune 
disorders. Recently, we have shown the absence of filarial infection in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who live 
in filarial-endemic areas. The mechanism(s) by which filarial-infected 
individuals are protected against the development of RA or SLE are unknown. In 
mice CIA, an experimental model for RA, ES-62, an execratory product of rodent 
filarial nematode , has been shown to improve arthritis through suppression of 
the IL-17 pathway. A total of 160 individuals, 40 each of endemic normal, 
filarial-infected cases, SLE and RA patients, from filarial-endemic areas, were 
enrolled in the study. Plasma levels of IL17-A, IFN-α and TNF-α were quantified 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RA and SLE patients displayed 
significantly higher plasma IL-17A, IFN-α and TNF-α levels compared to endemic 
normal and infected individuals. Furthermore, IL-17A levels were significantly 
low in participants with filarial infection compared to endemic controls ( 
p < 0.05). Interestingly, plasma IL-17A levels correlated inversely with 
circulating filarial antigen (CFA) ( p = 0.004, Spearman r = -0.51). Filarial 
infection was associated with low plasma IL-17A levels, a mechanism by which it 
possibly protects individuals in filarial-endemic areas from the development of 
autoimmune disorders like RA and SLE.

Objective The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics 
of acute transverse myelitis, including the time of their presentation, and to 
evaluate their effect on accrual damage in patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). Methods Patients with SLE who were hospitalized because of 
incident, noninfectious myelitis at our institute between January 1997 and 
December 2013 were identified. As a control group, we selected for each of the 
patients in the study group one SLE patient hospitalized at the closest date to 
the case due to other severe non-neuropsychiatric (NP) SLE manifestation, with 
no history of NP manifestations or noninfectious disease. Clinical 
characteristics, laboratory results, treatment, disease activity (SLEDAI-2K), 
and damage (SLICC/ACR-DI) were collected from medical charts at the index 
hospitalization and one year after hospitalization. Results Demographics and SLE 
characteristics, including age at SLE diagnosis and time since SLE diagnosis to 
hospitalization, were comparable in patients with myelitis and controls. At 
hospitalization, disease activity and cumulative damage were similar in both 
groups. Patients with myelitis received more aggressive treatment than controls. 
One year after hospitalization, two of the 15 patients who completed follow-up 
had symptom improvement without neurologic sequelae, and 13 of them had some 
improvement of symptoms with neurologic sequelae. Four patients died in the 
myelitis group, three of them of infectious diseases, and one of alveolar 
hemorrhage. No patient died because of myelopathy and in the control group no 
patient died, although three were lost during the follow-up. Disease activity 
and treatment did not differ between both groups. However, cumulative damage was 
higher among the patients with myelitis than controls (1.9 ± 0.9 vs 0.75 ± 0.9; 
p = 0.003). Conclusion Patients with myelitis have clinical characteristics 
similar to those observed in non-NP SLE and receive more aggressive treatment. 
Furthermore, myelitis is associated with a significant increase in accrual 
damage compared with severe non-NP manifestations.

AIM: Increasing evidence shows that the cardiac involvement attributes to the 
mortality of patients with lupus nephritis (LN) and echocardiography provides a 
valid measurement for cardiac disease. However, the association between 
echocardiographic parameters and mortality in LN patients without cardiac 
disease history remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the 
relationship between echocardiographic parameters and the mortality in 
hospitalized LN patients without cardiac disease history.
METHODS: A total of 436 LN patients without cardiac disease history who 
underwent echocardiography at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, between 1 January 
2000 and 31 December 2014, were enrolled into this study. The association 
between echocardiographic parameters and all-cause and cardiac mortality of LN 
patients was examined by the Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: In this cohort study, the median duration of follow-up was 18 months. 
Among 436 hospitalized LN patients, 88 patients (20.2%) died. Of them, 38 
patients (43.2%) died of cardiac disease. Cardiac symptoms, high systolic blood 
pressure, high serum levels of C-reactive protein, low serum albumin, low 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and decreased left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) were found to be independently associated with 
increased all-cause mortality. Furthermore, the cardiac symptoms, low eGFR, 
increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and decreased LVEF were 
independently correlated with an increased cardiac mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased LVEF was associated with increased all-cause and cardiac 
mortality and increased LVMI was an independent risk factor for cardiac 
mortality in hospitalized LN patients without cardiac disease history.

health plans in 2013 were associated with increased systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) damage in 2015.
METHODS: Data were derived from the Lupus Outcomes Study (LOS) annual surveys 
and include items from the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans and Interpersonal 
Processes of Care Scale measuring dimensions of health care interactions. We 
used ordinary least squares regression to model the change in disease damage 
over a 2-year period, 2013-2015, as a function of ratings of multiple dimensions 
of interactions with providers and health plans, with and without adjustment for 
demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and SLE and overall health 
status, and logistic regression to estimate the effect of the same matrix of 
variables on the probability of experiencing a minimum clinically important 
increase in damage.
RESULTS: There were 566 LOS respondents who were followed from 2013-2015 and who 
rated their providers and health plans in 2013. After adjustment, persons with 
SLE rating their providers poorly in patient-provider communication experienced 
a significantly greater accrual of disease damage (odds ratio [OR] 0.23 [95% 
confidence interval (95% CI) 0.09-0.38]) and were more likely to experience a 
minimum clinically important increase in damage (OR 2.35 [95% CI 1.25-4.39]). 
After adjustment, those rating their health plan poorly on care coordination 
experienced a significantly greater accrual of disease damage (OR 0.19 [95% CI 
0.03-0.35]) and were more likely to experience a minimum clinically important 
increase in damage (OR 2.20 [95% CI 1.12-4.34]).
CONCLUSION: Poor patient-provider communication and care coordination may result 
in increased disease damage.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of tabalumab, an anti-B cell 
activating factor (BAFF) antibody, in combination with standard of care (SoC) 
therapy in Japanese patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: A subgroup analysis was conducted in Japanese patients (n = 45) 
enrolled in ILLUMINATE-1, a phase III global trial in SLE patients (N = 1164). 
Patients received SoC plus tabalumab or placebo, starting with a loading dose 
(240 mg) at week 0, followed by 120 mg every 4 weeks (120 Q4W, n = 15), 120 mg 
every 2 weeks (120 Q2W, n = 15), or placebo Q2W (n = 15). The primary endpoint 
was proportion achieving SLE Responder Index-5 (SRI-5) improvement at week 52.
RESULTS: A numerically greater SRI-5 response rate was achieved with 120 Q2W 
(46.7%; p = 0.059 vs. placebo) compared with 120 Q4W (20.0%) and placebo Q2W 
(13.3%). The proportion of patients with severe SLE flare was lower for 120 Q2W 
(0%) and 120 Q4W (6.7%) than for placebo (26.7%). The rates of serious adverse 
events (AEs) and treatment-emergent AEs were similar across treatments.
CONCLUSION: In Japanese SLE patients, tabalumab 120 Q2W improved SRI-5 response 
rate and reduced the frequency of severe flares compared with placebo. Safety 
profiles were similar with tabalumab and placebo.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune destructive joint disease affecting 
1 % of the general population. In recent years, the benefits of identifying RA 
at an early stage and initiating therapy before joint damage occurs have been 
acknowledged. An elevated anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) level 
serves as a marker for the early diagnosis of RA. Often the diagnosis is delayed 
because conventional methods of antibody detection require referral to a 
specific laboratory. In the current study, we determined the diagnostic accuracy 
of a new lateral flow point-of-care kit available for ACPA detection in the 
rheumatologist office. The presence of ACPA was determined by the visually read, 
qualitative rapid CCPoint® test (Euro-Diagnostica, Malmö, Sweden) compared to 
routinely used ELISA assays (Immunoscan CCPlus®-Euro-Diagnostica, Sweden, and 
QuantLite® CCP3-INOVA Diagnostics Inc., USA), in the sera of 184 patients: early 
RA(n = 38), established RA (n = 84), inflammatory arthritis(n = 34) and systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n = 28). ACPA was detected in 18/38(47 %), 
53/84(63 %), 2/34(6 %) and 2/28(7 %) of patients with early RA, established RA, 
inflammatory arthritis and SLE, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity, 
negative and positive predictive values of the CCPoint® test were equivalent to 
the Immunoscan CCPlus® and Quanta Lite® CCP3 ELISA assays. Correlation between 
ACPA positive results detected in the different assays was 97 %, while negative 
agreement reached 98 %. Excellent correlation (100 %) was observed between 
CCPoint® results obtained using capillary blood versus serum. CCPoint® is a 
novel technology that allows for a rapid accurate analysis of ACPA and diagnosis 
during the patient's visit in the rheumatologist office.

This study aimed to evaluate P300 as an electrophysiological marker of cognitive 
function in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who had previous 
neuropsychiatric (NPSLE) involvement and were diagnosed to have cognitive 
impairment by standard neuropsychological tests. Event-related potentials (ERPs) 
were assessed by the auditory and visual oddball paradigms. Amplitude and 
latency of P300 at the frontal (Fz), central (Cz), and parietal (Pz) regions 
were determined and compared with controls. P300 detection was performed in 
NPSLE patients with pre-diagnosed cognitive impairment (n = 9), matched SLE 
patients without previous NPSLE (non-NPSLE) (n = 9), and healthy controls (n = 
15). Auditory oddball task did not show any P300 abnormality between groups. 
Visual oddball task revealed reduced amplitude of P300 over Fz ( P = .002) and 
Cz ( P = .009) electrodes in NPSLE patients compared with healthy controls and 
among those who had predominant memory deficit ( P = .01 at Fz). Abnormal P300 
was also observed in non-NPSLE patients at Fz and Cz. Using visual oddball 
paradigm, abnormal P300 was found in NPSLE patients over frontal and parietal 
regions compared with normal controls but was not discriminative from possible 
subclinical disease in non-NPSLE patients. In conclusion, visual oddball 
paradigm was a more sensitive electrophysiological marker than auditory oddball 
paradigm for cognitive impairment in NPSLE patients.

AIM: The clinical and histological features of lupus nephritis (LN) are highly 
variable, depending on race and ethnicity. The Japan Renal Biopsy Registry 
(J-RBR) is a nationwide registry of renal biopsies. Here, we report a 
cross-sectional analysis of Japanese LN using the J-RBR database.
METHODS: Out of 18 463 patients registered in the J-RBR, 331 LN patients, who 
received renal biopsy for the first time, were extracted and their clinical 
features were analyzed according to the ISN/RPS 2003 classification.
RESULTS: The median age of the 331 LN patients was 37 years (women, 81.3%). The 
frequencies of each of the ISN/RPS Classes were as follows: I, 1.2%; II, 7.9%; 
III (±V), 25.1%; IV-S (±V), 13.0%; IV-G (±V), 31.1%; V, 20.8%; and VI, 0.9%. The 
level of proteinuria and the prevalence of nephrotic syndrome were highest for 
Class IV-G (±V). When Classes I, II, and VI were excluded from the analysis, 
Class IV-G (±V) was significantly associated with a lower eGFR and severer 
haematuria than the other classes.
CONCLUSION: This nationwide study revealed that Class IV-G (±V) was the most 
prevalent form of LN in Japan and was associated with a severe clinical renal 
presentation.

OBJECTIVES: Develop recommendations for women's health issues and family 
planning in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS).
METHODS: Systematic review of evidence followed by modified Delphi method to 
compile questions, elicit expert opinions and reach consensus.
RESULTS: Family planning should be discussed as early as possible after 
diagnosis. Most women can have successful pregnancies and measures can be taken 
to reduce the risks of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Risk stratification 
includes disease activity, autoantibody profile, previous vascular and pregnancy 
morbidity, hypertension and the use of drugs (emphasis on benefits from 
hydroxychloroquine and antiplatelets/anticoagulants). Hormonal contraception and 
menopause replacement therapy can be used in patients with stable/inactive 
disease and low risk of thrombosis. Fertility preservation with 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues should be considered prior to the use 
of alkylating agents. Assisted reproduction techniques can be safely used in 
patients with stable/inactive disease; patients with positive antiphospholipid 
antibodies/APS should receive anticoagulation and/or low-dose aspirin. 
Assessment of disease activity, renal function and serological markers is 
important for diagnosing disease flares and monitoring for obstetrical adverse 
outcomes. Fetal monitoring includes Doppler ultrasonography and fetal biometry, 
particularly in the third trimester, to screen for placental insufficiency and 
small for gestational age fetuses. Screening for gynaecological malignancies is 
similar to the general population, with increased vigilance for cervical 
premalignant lesions if exposed to immunosuppressive drugs. Human papillomavirus 
immunisation can be used in women with stable/inactive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for women's health issues in SLE and/or APS were 
developed using an evidence-based approach followed by expert consensus.

AIMS: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease 
involving multiple organs, including the central nervous system. Evidence of 
immune dysfunction exists also in schizophrenia, a psychiatric illness involving 
chronic or recurrent psychosis. The aim of our study was to investigate if there 
is an epidemiological association between SLE and schizophrenia.
METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted comparing patients with SLE with 
age and gender-matched controls regarding the proportion of patients with 
comorbid schizophrenia. χ 2- and t-tests were used for univariate analysis, and 
interaction of schizophrenia with SLE across strata of covariates was checked. A 
logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study was 
performed utilising the medical database of Clalit Health Services in Israel.
RESULTS: The study included 5018 patients with SLE and 25 090 controls. SLE 
patients had a female predominance, and a higher proportion of smoking compared 
with age and sex-matched controls. In multivariate analysis, SLE was found to be 
independently associated with schizophrenia while controlling for age, gender, 
socioeconomic status (SES) and smoking (OR 1.33, p = 0.042).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive association between SLE and schizophrenia 
across patients of different age, gender and SES. This association can 
contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of the two disorders and may 
also have clinical implications for earlier as well as better diagnosis and 
treatment.

We describe two cases of non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and 
multifocal stenosis of the intracranial arteries. The patients' histories 
together with magnetic resonance angiography, vessel wall imaging and 
transcranial Doppler (TCD) indicated that the SAH was due to vasculitis or 
reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Differential diagnosis of 
vasculitis and RCVS is important because the treatment strategies are different: 
immunosuppressants in vasculitis and calcium channel blockers in RCVS. Vessel 
wall magnetic resonance imaging and TCD can be helpful in differentiating them.

Diseases, Seoul, Korea.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase (eNOS) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted on associations between the 4b/a, T786C, 
and G894T polymorphisms of eNOS and SLE or RA using the following methods: 
(1) allele contrast, (2) recessive model, (3) dominant model, and (4) homozygous 
contrast.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising eleven 
studies on SLE (1561 patients and 1565 controls) and eight on RA (1624 patients 
and 2118 controls). Meta-analysis showed a significant association between SLE 
and the 4b/a polymorphism using the recessive model and the homozygous contrast 
(odds ratio [OR] = 1.836, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.171-2.878, p = 
0.008; OR = 2.055, 95 % CI = 1.302-3.243, p = 0.002). Ethnicity-specific 
meta-analysis showed a significant association between the aa vs. bb of the 4b/a 
polymorphism and SLE in European populations (OR = 2.096, 95 % CI = 1.288-4.0, 
p = 0.027), but not in Arab populations. Stratification by presence of lupus 
nephritis (LN) indicated a significant association between the a allele and the 
aa + ab genotype of the 4b/a polymorphism and LN in SLE patients (OR = 2.125, 
95 % CI = 1.289-3.054, p = 0.003; OR = 2.655, 95 % CI = 1.509-4.671, p = 0.001). 
Meta-analysis indicated no association between SLE and the T786C and G894T 
polymorphisms. No association was found between the eNOS 4b/a, T786C, and G894T 
polymorphisms and RA CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of published studies shows 
that the eNOS 4b/a polymorphism may be associated with the development of SLE, 
but the 4b/a, T786C, and G894T polymorphisms may be not associated with RA 
susceptibility.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the plasma melatonin levels in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and its relationship with clinical 
and laboratory features.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 patients with SLE (82 females, 8 males; mean 
age 37.86 ± 13.98 years, range 19-77 years) and 90 healthy controls (82 females, 
8 male; mean age 36.54 ± 10.89 years, range 22-60 years) were recruited for the 
current study. Plasma melatonin levels were detected by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Melatonin levels were not significantly different in the plasma of 
patients with SLE compared with controls (P = 0.026). There was no significant 
difference regarding plasma melatonin level between SLE patients with nephritis 
and those without nephritis (P = 0.714); no significant difference was found 
between less active SLE and more active SLE (P = 0.791). The presence of IgM was 
associated with melatonin levels (P = 0.031) in SLE patients.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in plasma melatonin levels

role of melatonin in SLE.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology published in 2011 revised recommendations 
regarding screening for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) toxicity. We aimed to assess 
implementation of these recommendations by rheumatologists and ophthalmologists. 
A questionnaire regarding screening practices for HCQ toxicity was distributed 
among all members of the Israeli societies of Rheumatology and Ophthalmology. A 
total of 128 physicians responded to the questionnaire (rheumatologists: 60, 
ophthalmologists: 68). Only 5% of the rheumatologists and 15% of the 
ophthalmologists are aware of ophthalmologic assessments recommended for 
baseline and follow-up evaluation. When an abnormal test is detected, even if 
inappropriate for HCQ toxicity screening, 60% of the responders recommend 
cessation of therapy. Only 13% of the responders recommend first follow-up after 
five years for patients without risk factors; the remainder recommend more 
frequent testing. Ninety-six percent of the responders are not aware of all of 
the known risk factors for HCQ toxicity. Use of inappropriate tests to detect 
HCQ retinal toxicity may lead to unnecessary cessation of beneficial treatment 
with risk of disease flare, while lack of consideration of risk factors may put 
patients at risk for toxicity. These results emphasize the importance of 
implementing the recommendations to ensure safe and effective use of this drug.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the retina of patients with active systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) using fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), irrespective of 
their visual acuity or fundus examination.
METHODS: A descriptive study was performed on 30 patients with active SLE; 
disease activity was calculated using The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease 
Activity Index (SLEDAI). Fundus examination and FFA angiography were done to all 
patients.
RESULTS: A total of 60 eyes of 30 patients were included. Their mean age was 
32.6 ± 1.17 years. All patients showed disease activity at time of examination 
according to SLEDAI. Retinopathy was detected by FAF in 24 eyes (40%), 10 eyes 
of which had normal fundus examination. SLEDAI was positively correlated to the 
presence of retinopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: All patients with ocular lupus should be carefully evaluated for 
systemic involvement and, vice versa, all patients diagnosed with SLE should 
have a thorough ocular examination and FFA, even if they had normal fundus.

Objectives Lupus is a classical systemic autoimmune disease with genetics as one 
of the well known causative factors for the disease pathogenesis. Toll-like 
receptors are the major pattern recognition receptors associated with innate 
immunity and also act as an interface with the adaptive immunity. Genetic 
polymorphisms in genes encoding TLRs were implicated in the development of 
infections, malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TLR9 is a member of TLR 
family, and recognizes the CpG DNA motifs of pathogens. Though the incidence 
rate of lupus in Asians was reported to be low (30 - 50/100,000 population), 
poor disease prognosis due to higher incidence of renal complications and 
aggressive disease worsens the scenario. The ability of TLR9 to detect and 
elicit an immune response against double-stranded DNA makes TLR9 a relevant 
factor to be tested for its association with the clinical and serological 
phenotypes of lupus. However, lack of relevant genetic data on normative 
frequencies of the TLR9 (rs187084) polymorphism may serve as a constraint to 
derive the sample size to conduct case control association studies. Hence this 
study was conducted to establish the normative frequency of TLR9 (rs187084) 
polymorphism in Indian Tamils. Materials and methods The TLR9 (rs187084) 
polymorphism was screened in South Indian Tamils ( n = 208) by PCR-RFLP. Results 
and discussion We observed a higher occurrence of the mutant allele (65%) in 
South Indian Tamils. No gender disparity with respect to the mutant allele 
frequency was observed. The higher incidence of mutant allele in both genders 
suggests that this population had undergone a genetic selection pressure as an 
evolutionary genetic measure to withstand the prevailing endemic infections like 
TB and malaria. Though the enhanced expression of TLR9 was protective against 
infections, it may also influence the development of autoimmune diseases. 
Conclusion The higher incidence of theTLR9 (rs187084) over-expression mutation 
in Indian Tamils is suggestive of a genetic adaptation or selection pressure to 
withstand the prevailing endemic infectious and parasitic diseases. However, 
this genetic adaptation poses a greater risk to develop autoimmune diseases like 
SLE etc through complex gene environment interactions. The normative frequency 
of the TLR9 (rs187084) polymorphism established in our population could now be 
used to define the sample size for future case control studies.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may involve the nervous system but there are 
no specific biomarkers of neuroSLE. Limbic encephalitis has been rarely 
associated with SLE. We present a case of a 22-year-old black woman where 
typical SLE psychosis evolved to an encephalopathy with atypical features, 
normal MRI, electroencephalogram slowing and frontal and occipito-temporal 
hypometabolism on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG 
PET).Memory deficits, bizarre behaviour, psychosis, neuromyotonia and movement 
disorders have been described in autoimmune central nervous system disorders and 
associated with specific antibodies. Brain MRI may be normal and cortical brain 
hypometabolism on FDG PET scans has been reported. We have not found any report 
of limbic encephalitis or other SLE neurological manifestation associated to 
positive titres of anti-CASPR2 antibodies and this may warrant systematic 
investigation. In the rare cases of limbic encephalitis associated with SLE no 
specific antibodies were documented. Anti-CASPR2 antibodies have been associated 
not only with limbic encephalitis but also with neuromyotonia and Morvan 
syndrome. Although our patient had a specific pattern of tone abnormalities with 
an impressive cervical and upper limb hypertonicity and flaccid lower limbs, no 
myotonic discharges were found. We did not find any association between 
myoclonus and anti-CASPR2 antibodies. We cannot exclude that a non determined 
autoantibody could have played a role; however, clinical and FDG PET improvement 
supports an antibody-mediated injury, in this case of neuroSLE.

CHOROIDAL THICKNESS IN MULTISYSTEMIC AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES WITHOUT OPHTHALMOLOGIC 
MANIFESTATIONS.

Author information:

Portugal.

PURPOSE: To evaluate choroidal morphology and thickness at the posterior pole of 
individuals affected by multisystemic autoimmune diseases and without known 
ophthalmologic manifestations.
METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study including 75 patients with 
autoimmune diseases (divided according to their specific disease) and 80 healthy 
controls. A spectral-domain optical coherence tomography using enhanced depth 
imaging was performed and choroidal thickness was measured in the center of 
fovea and at 500 μm intervals along a horizontal section.
RESULTS: Lupus patients presented a thicker subfoveal choroid than controls 
(408.624 vs. 356.536, P < 0.001) and in all the other measurements (P < 0.001 to 
P = 0.003). Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases had an overall 
thinner choroid than controls (297.867 vs. 356.536 subfoveally, P = 0.004; P = 
0.005-0.019 in other measurements). Results were adjusted for the covariates age 
(P = 0.007), spherical equivalent (P < 0.001), and systemic steroids dose (P = 
0.004). Hypertension (P = 0.102), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.672), time since the 
beginning of therapy with hydroxychloroquine (P = 0.104) and its cumulative dose 
(P = 0.307), or use of other immunosuppressives (P = 0.281) had no influence on 
the mean choroidal thickness. No morphologic abnormalities were found.
CONCLUSION: The choroid may be subclinically involved in autoimmune diseases. 
However, the choroidal response seems to differ depending on the autoimmune 
disease. Infiltrative mechanisms specific for lupus may justify the thickened 
choroid found in these patients.

OBJECTIVE: Dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses contributes to 
the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its associated 
premature vascular damage. No drug to date targets both systemic inflammatory 
disease and the cardiovascular complications of SLE. Tofacitinib is a JAK 
inhibitor that blocks signaling downstream of multiple cytokines implicated in 
lupus pathogenesis. While clinical trials have shown that tofacitinib exhibits 
significant clinical efficacy in various autoimmune diseases, its role in SLE 
and the associated vascular pathology remains to be characterized.
METHODS: MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice were administered tofacitinib or vehicle by 
gavage for 6 weeks (therapeutic arm) or 8 weeks (preventive arm). Nephritis, 
skin inflammation, serum levels of autoantibodies and cytokines, mononuclear 
cell phenotype and gene expression, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) 
release, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and endothelial differentiation 
were compared in treated and untreated mice.
RESULTS: Treatment with tofacitinib led to significant improvement in measures 
of disease activity, including nephritis, skin inflammation, and autoantibody 
production. In addition, tofacitinib treatment reduced serum levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines and interferon responses in splenocytes and kidney 
tissue. Tofacitinib also modulated the formation of NETs and significantly 
increased endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and endothelial differentiation. 
The drug was effective in both preventive and therapeutic strategies.
CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib modulates the innate and adaptive immune responses, 
ameliorates murine lupus, and improves vascular function. These results indicate 
that JAK inhibitors have the potential to be beneficial in SLE and its 
associated vascular damage.

OBJECTIVE: B cell-depletion therapy based on rituximab is a therapeutic option 
for refractory disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The 
aim of this observational study was to document long-term effects on B cell 
function by following serum immunoglobulin levels in patients with SLE treated 
with rituximab in routine clinical practice.
METHODS: We included 57 consecutive patients with SLE treated with rituximab and 
concomitant/sequential immunosuppressants and measured serum total IgG, IgM, and 
IgA and IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies, over a median of 48 months most recent 
followup. Flow cytometry was used prospectively to assess B cell phenotypes in 
17 of 57 patients.
RESULTS: Twelve patients (21%) had persistent IgM hypogammaglobulinemia (<0.4 
gm/liter), and 4 of 57 (5%) had low IgG (<7 gm/liter) at the most recent 
followup (range 12-144 months). This was not associated with serious adverse 
events or high anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies (>1,000 IU/ml; 
normal <50 IU/ml). Factors predictive of low serum IgM included baseline serum 
IgM ≤0.8 gm/liter (receiver operator curve analysis) and subsequent therapy with 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; odds ratio 6.8, compared with other 
immunosuppressants). In patients maintaining normal IgM levels (9 of 17), the 
frequency of circulating IgD+CD27+ B cells was significantly higher (P = 0.05). 
At 12 months after rituximab, 7 of 30 SLE patients with baseline anti-dsDNA 
≤1,000 IU/ml had lost seropositivity.
CONCLUSION: Lower baseline serum IgM levels and sequential therapy with MMF were 
predictive of IgM hypogammaglobulinemia after rituximab in SLE, but this was not 
associated with higher levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies or an increased risk of 
infections. This provides useful directions for clinicians regarding rituximab 
and sequential immunosuppressive treatment for patients with SLE.

Suicidal NETosis differs from other mechanisms of cell death by the release of a 
lattice, composed of DNA associated with proteins citrullinated by 
protein-arginine deiminase 4, from neutrophils. These 'NETs' are composed of 
granule-derived proteins with microbicidal activity. A similar type of release 
occurs during vital NETosis, in which anuclear neutrophils maintain their 
chemotactic ability and imprison live bacteria, even after NET extrusion. 
Mitochondrial NETosis is limited to the expulsion of oxidised mitochondrial DNA 
and cytoplasmic enzymes. NETs include the targets of most autoantibodies found 
in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and vasculitis. The clinical and biological 
overlaps sometimes observed between bronchectiasis and RA, RA and SLE, or SLE 
and vasculitis, implicate NETosis as a major triggering event common to these 
disorders. NETosis increases the possibility of association between autoantigens 
and infectious antigens in mucosal biofilms, impairing the clearance of 
pathogens and possibly triggering autoimmune reactions. NETosis aggravates these 
three conditions and increases endothelial damage and the risk of thrombosis. 
However, the pathogenesis of RA, SLE, and vasculitis is not confined to 
autoantibodies against NET components, and other mechanisms have been suggested 
to explain the breakdown of tolerance to NET autoantigens, such as 
hypercitrullination. The question of whether continuous presentation of 
autoantigens mixed with antigens from dormant intracellular pathogens (released 
following suicidal, vital, or mitochondrial NETosis) is required to induce and 
sustain autoimmunity must be addressed. Inhibiting NETois may not be sufficient 
to improve autoimmune disorders whereas such latent infections remain 
uncontrolled.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE) is a heterogeneous and complex disease 
produced by diverse pathogenic events in the innate and adaptive immune system. 
Lupus nephritis affects over half of all patients with lupus and leads to 
substantial morbidity and mortality. This review presents our current 
understanding of the development of lupus nephritis and examines the role of 
genetics and epigenetics in further elucidating the pathogenesis of the disease. 
Advancements in genomics are leading the way to better understanding and novel 
biologic therapies for SLE.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are associated with cardiac 
valve disease in lupus.
METHODS: A single-center, medical chart review was performed. Lupus patients 
were divided according to its anti-Ro/SSA status and subgroups were compared for 
valvular abnormalities and other characteristics. Dependence of anti-Ro/SSA 
reactivity to anti-Ro52/TRIM21 antibodies was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine lupus patients were analyzed. The most common valvular 
abnormalities were tricuspid (60%), mitral (41%) and pulmonary (14%) 
regurgitation. Thirty-six patients were positive and 53 negative for anti-Ro/SSA 
antibodies. In patients positive to anti-Ro/SSA, a difference was noted for 
anti-dsDNA (67 versus 45%; p = 0.04) and anti-La/SSB (19 versus 2%; p = 0.004) 
antibodies. An association between anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and severe mitral 
regurgitation was observed; indeed, 4/15 patients with anti-Ro/SSA and mitral 
regurgitation had severe forms of valvulopathy as compared to only 1/22 patients 
with mitral regurgitation but negative to such antibody (27 versus 5%; 
p = 0.02). Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies significantly elevated the risk of severe 
mitral regurgitation (OR = 5). Anti-Ro52/TRIM21 levels (103 ± 29 versus 
42 ± 43 U/mL; p = 0.03) and anti-Ro52/TRIM21: anti-Ro/SSA ratios 
(0.88 ± 0.02 versus 0.35 ± 0.37; p = 0.03) were higher in patients with mitral 
valve regurgitation than in those with no valvulopathy.
CONCLUSION: Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, mainly against Ro52/TRIM21 antigens, may be 
pathologically involved in lupus-associated mitral valve regurgitation.

The pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis is 
complex but no longer enigmatic. Much progress has been made to on the 
polygenetic origin of lupus in identifying gene variants that permit the loss of 
tolerance against nuclear autoantigens. Along the same line in about 50% of 
lupus patients additional genetic weaknesses promote immune complex 
glomerulonephritis and filtration barrier dysfunction. Here we briefly summarize 
the pathogenesis of SLE with a focus on loss of tolerance and the role of 
toll-like receptors in the "pseudo"-antiviral immunity concept of systemic 
lupus. In addition, we discuss the local role of Toll-like receptors in 
intrarenal inflammation and kidney remodeling.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with 
multi-organ inflammation, linked to loss of immune tolerance to self-antigens 
and the production of a diversity of autoantibodies, with a negative impact on 
the patients' quality of life. Regulatory T cells have been reported as 
deficient in number and function in SLE patients. However, some authors also 
described an enrichment of this cell type. The hypothesis that certain forms of 
autoimmunity may result from a conversion of Treg cells into a Th17 cell 
phenotype has been suggested by some studies. In fact, in SLE patients' sera, 
the IL-17 levels were observed as abnormally high when compared with healthy 
individuals. Environmental factors, such as vitamin D, that is considered a 
potential anti-inflammatory agent, combined with genetic and hormonal 
characteristics have been associated with SLE phenotype and with disease 
progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D 
supplementation on FoxP3 expression and IL-17A-producing T cells, through 
FoxP3+/IL-17A ratio. Additionally, disease evolution, serum vitamin D levels, 
serum autoantibodies levels and calcium metabolism (to assure safety) were also 
studied. We assessed 24 phenotypically well-characterized SLE patients. All 
patients were screened before vitamin D supplementation and 3 and 6 months after 
the beginning of this treatment. Peripheral blood lymphocyte's subsets were 
analysed by flow cytometry. Serum 25(OH)D levels significantly increased under 
vitamin D supplementation (p = 0.001). The FoxP3+/IL-17A ratio in SLE patients 
after 6 months of vitamin D supplementation was higher than that in the baseline 
(p < 0.001). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that vitamin D 
supplementation provided favourable, immunological and clinical impact on SLE.

The association between hepatitis B and autoimmune disorders has been intriguing 
for decades. Many reports have speculated on the possible linkage between these 
two conditions, yet never before data driven from a large national database was 
utilized in order to investigate this issue. The objective of this study was to 
investigate the association between SLE and hepatitis B carrier state. Patients 
with SLE were compared with age- and sex-matched controls regarding the 
proportion of hepatitis B carrier state in a case-control study. Chi-square and 
t tests were used for univariate analysis, and a logistic regression model was 
used for multivariate analysis. The study was performed utilizing the medical 
database of Clalit Health Services. The study included 5018 lupus patients over 
the age of 20 years and 25,090 age- and sex-frequency-matched controls without 
SLE. The proportion of hepatitis B carriers was higher in SLE patients as 
compared to controls (0.9 and 0.56 %, respectively; p < 0.001). A significant 
association was also observed among patients in lower socioeconomic status. In a 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, SLE was significantly associated with 
hepatitis B (OR = 1.828, 95 % CI = 1.291-2.590). Patients with SLE have a 
greater proportion of hepatitis B carrier state than matched controls.

Despite the emergence of newer immunomodulating agents for systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), a substantial proportion of patients still do not respond 
optimally. While the mechanisms for the differential responses to drug therapy 
are unclear, variation in drug exposure with the same dosing protocol related to 
pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic factors may contribute. This article 
discusses the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to optimize therapies in 
SLE patients. Areas covered: Evidence on the relationship between blood levels 
and efficacy/toxicity of immuno-modulating drugs such as hydroxychloroquine 
(HCQ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and the calcineurin inhibitors that are often 
used in SLE. Expert commentary: Current data suggest a correlation between 
exposure and efficacy of HCQ and MMF in SLE. The relationship between HCQ or MMF 
blood concentrations and their adverse effects requires further elucidation. The 
serum trough level of tacrolimus does not appear to correlate with clinical 
response in lupus nephritis but is associated with toxic effects. Owing to the 
paucity of data, the 'optimal' blood levels of these agents in SLE have yet to 
be determined by large population pharmacokinetic studies. Nevertheless, TDM 
enables early identification of non-adherence and over-exposure to these SLE 
medications so that dosing adjustment can be performed to minimize toxicities 
and wastage.

Objective Hepcidin regulates iron availability and may be responsible for the 
anemia of chronic disease because it is induced by interleukin-6. This study 
investigated the IL-6-hepcidin-hemoglobin axis in patients with lupus. Methods 
IL-6 and hepcidin were measured in serial serum samples collected before, during 
and after lupus flares by specific ELISAs. Results During renal and non-renal 
SLE flare cycles IL-6 did not predict hepcidin and hepcidin did not predict 
hemoglobin. When lupus nephritis patients were in remission, IL-6 and hepcidin 
were correlated, but hepcidin and hemoglobin were not. Conclusion Hepcidin does 
not contribute significantly to anemia during active lupus.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients may present with various symptoms 
and multisystem damage. We reported a 63-year-old male patient with SLE 
presenting as type B insulin resistance (TBIR) complicated with 
cryoglobulinemia. TBIR is an extremely rare disease, which is a manifestation of 
anti-insulin receptor antibodies (AIRA). Clinical feature is a sudden onset of 
hyperglycemia with major weight loss; however, the ensuing refractory 
hypoglycemia is more fatal. The average dosage of exogenous insulin is 5100 U/d. 
SLE patients with AIRA had poor prognosis, most of whom died of SLE activity. 
Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that reversibly precipitate in the cold, which 
will induce clinical symptoms. Non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemia is 
frequently secondary to autoimmune diseases, such as SLE. Our patient was 
prescribed methylprednisolone (MP) and cyclophosphamide (CTX). Finally he had 
remission during the short-term follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first 
case report of an SLE patient presenting as TBIR complicated with 
cryoglobulinemia.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease that 
involves many organs and systems. Nervous system involvement in SLE encompasses 
neurological and psychiatric disorders, and remains a diagnostic and therapeutic 
challenge. Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological disorder that occurs 
as a consequence of thiamine deficiency, and its clinical presentation resembles 
the neuropsychiatric events attributed to SLE (NPSLE). Differentiation between 
these two entities is crucial because their treatment differs greatly and can 
change prognosis. We describe three cases of patients with SLE who presented 
with initial clinical findings suggestive of NPSLE that, at the end of a 
thorough clinical investigation, were actually found to represent WE. In all of 
these cases, treatment with thiamine resulted in significant improvement. WE 
should be considered as a differential diagnosis in SLE patients with 
neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, especially when risk factors for thiamine 
deficiency are present.

Objectives Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with elevated levels 
of S100A8/A9, pro-inflammatory proteins mainly secreted by activated 
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). The underlying mechanisms for increased 
S100A8/A9 levels and their relation to the clinical phenotype have not been 
carefully investigated. We assessed S100A8/A9 and S100A12 levels in SLE patient 
sera in relation to disease activity, clinical phenotype, presence of anti-dsDNA 
antibodies and ability to promote phagocytosis of necrotic cells (NCs) by PMNs. 
Methods Serum levels of S100A8/A9 and S100A12 were measured by ELISA in paired 
samples of 100 SLE patients at time points of higher and lower disease activity. 
Serum-mediated phagocytosis of NCs by PMNs was analysed by flow cytometry. 
Clinical data were recorded at time points of blood sampling. Results Serum 
levels of S100A8/A9 and S100A12 were increased in SLE patients with high disease 
activity compared to paired samples at low disease activity ( p = 0.01 and 
p = 0.008, respectively). Elevated levels of S100A8/A9 were particularly seen in 
patients with anti-dsDNA antibodies ( p = 0.01) and glomerulonephritis before 
treatment ( p = 0.02). Immunosuppressive therapy was associated with a reduction 
of S100A8/A9 serum levels ( p = 0.002). The ability of serum to support 
phagocytosis of NCs by PMNs was related to increased S100A8/A9 levels ( 
p = 0.01). Conclusions Elevated serum levels of S100A8/A9 may be used to monitor 
disease activity and response to treatment in SLE patients, especially in 
patients with glomerulonephritis. S100A12 may be a marker of disease activity in 
SLE. Increased S100A8/A9 levels may reflect immune-pathological processes 
involving phagocytosis of immune complexes by PMNs.

Clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in female patients 
with polysomy X have been less characterized as compared to those in male 
patients. Here, we describe a 28-year-old woman with trisomy X (47,XXX) who 
developed SLE. She had polyarthritis, hemolytic anemia, and was positive for 
anti-nuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies. We discuss the common SLE manifestations 
with female polysomy X and the possible link between the development of SLE and 
the presence of extra X-chromosomes.

OBJECTIVE: Using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and Systemic Lupus 
International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria for systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) classification as gold standards, we determined sensitivity, 
specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of having SLE 
denoted as the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US Renal 
Data System (USRDS).
METHODS: ESRD patients were identified by International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision codes in electronic medical records of 1 large tertiary 
care center, Montefiore Hospital, from 2006 to 2012. Clinical data were 
extracted and reviewed to establish SLE diagnosis. Data were linked by social 
security number, name, and date of birth to the USRDS, where primary causes of 
ESRD were ascertained.
RESULTS: Of 7,396 ESRD patients at Montefiore, 97 met ACR/SLICC SLE criteria, 
and 86 had SLE by record only. Among the 97 SLE patients, the attributed causes 
of ESRD in the USRDS were 77 SLE and 12 with other causes (unspecified 
glomerulonephritis, hypertension, scleroderma), and 8 missing. Sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV, and NPV for SLE in the USRDS were 79%, 99.9%, 93%, and 99.7%, 
respectively. Of the 60 patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis, 44 (73%) 
had SLE as primary ESRD cause in the USRDS. Attribution of the primary ESRD 
causes among SLE patients with ACR/SLICC criteria differed by race, ethnicity, 
and transplant status.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of SLE as the primary cause of ESRD in the USRDS has 
good sensitivity, and excellent specificity, PPV, and NPV. Nationwide access to 
medical records and biopsy reports may significantly improve sensitivity of SLE 
diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate effectiveness and safety of belimumab in patients with 
active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a clinical practice setting.
METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with active SLE, mean ± SD age 39.3 ± 10.2 years, 
from 2 Italian prospective cohorts were treated with belimumab (10 mg/kg on day 
0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days) added to background therapy. The Systemic 
Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), the Systemic Lupus 
International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage 
Index, the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), 24-hour proteinuria, the 
Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) activity 
score, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), C3 and C4 levels, and prednisone 
daily dose were recorded at baseline, month 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24. Arthritis 
was subdivided into "classical" (CLP) and "rheumatoid-like"; skin manifestations 
into acute (ACLE), subacute (SCLE), and chronic. SLE flares, defined according 
to the SLEDAI Flare Index, were calculated before and after belimumab 
initiation. Adverse events were carefully evaluated during treatment. Statistics 
were performed by the SPSS package (version 21.0).
RESULTS: Mean ± SD followup was 16.2 ± 9.5 months. Main refractory 
manifestations treated with belimumab were musculoskeletal (37.3%), 
mucocutaneous (22.4%), and renal (23.9%). SLEDAI-2K, prednisone daily dose, 
anti-dsDNA, DAS28, CLASI, and 24-hour proteinuria decreased during treatment. 
DAS28 score decreased in patients with polyarthritis (P < 0.001), particularly 
in those with CLP (P < 0.001), and CLASI decreased in patients with skin 
manifestation (P = 0.003), either ACLE (P = 0.051) or SCLE (P = 0.047). Flare 
rate was lower 1 and 2 years after belimumab initiation than in the periods 
before (P = 0.001). Belimumab was well-tolerated and no damage accrual was 
observed after initiation.
CONCLUSION: Belimumab was effective and safe in a clinical practice setting; it 
decreased the number of flares and hindered damage progression in patients with 
active SLE.

OBJECTIVE: Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased 
incidence of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). A relationship between 
depression and increased inflammation leading to CVD has been proposed. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate the relationship between depression and the 
progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in women with SLE.
METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, 149 participants with SLE and 
126 controls were followed over 5 years. Evaluation included laboratory studies, 
assessment of CVD risk factors, depression screening, ultrasound evaluations of 
carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid plaque, and assessment of SLE 
disease activity for the SLE cases.
RESULTS: The SLE group had a higher rate of depression: 29% compared with 11% in 
the control group (P = 0.003). When controlling for traditional CVD risk 
factors, the presence of baseline depression correlated with increased 
progression of CIMT in the SLE group, but not in the control group. The mean 
increase in CIMT was 0.026 mm in the SLE group without depression versus 0.064 
mm in the depressed SLE group (P = 0.0096). There was no association between 
depression and carotid plaque in either group, with a calculated odds ratio for 
plaque progression in the depressed SLE group of 1.118 (95% confidence interval 
0.476, 2.623) in the adjusted model.
CONCLUSION: Women with SLE and concomitant depression have an increased risk of 
developing subclinical atherosclerosis, as measured by CIMT, but not by carotid 
plaque. The data suggest that depression, a potentially modifiable risk factor, 
may contribute to the increased risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in women 
with SLE.

OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the ACP5 gene, which encodes tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase (TRAP), cause the immuno-osseous disorder 
spondyloenchondrodysplasia, which includes as disease features systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) and a type I interferon (IFN) signature. Our aims were to 
identify TRAP substrates, determine the consequences of TRAP deficiency in 
immune cells, and assess whether ACP5 mutations are enriched in sporadic cases 
of SLE.
METHODS: Interaction between TRAP and its binding partners was tested by a yeast 
2-hybrid screening, confocal microscopy, and immunoprecipitation/Western 
blotting. TRAP knockdown was performed using small interfering RNA. 
Phosphorylation of osteopontin (OPN) was analyzed by mass spectrometry. 
Nucleotide sequence analysis of ACP5 was performed by Sanger sequencing or 
next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: TRAP and OPN colocalized and interacted in human macrophages and 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs). TRAP dephosphorylated 3 serine residues on 
specific OPN peptides. TRAP knockdown resulted in increased OPN phosphorylation 
and increased nuclear translocation of IRF7 and P65, with resultant heightened 
expression of IFN-stimulated genes and IL6 and TNF following Toll-like receptor 
9 stimulation. An excess of heterozygous ACP5 missense variants was observed in 
SLE compared to controls (P = 0.04), and transfection experiments revealed a 
significant reduction in TRAP activity in a number of variants.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that TRAP and OPN colocalize and that OPN is a 
substrate for TRAP in human immune cells. TRAP deficiency in PDCs leads to 
increased IFNα production, providing at least a partial explanation for how ACP5 
mutations cause lupus in the context of spondyloenchondrodysplasia. Detection of 
ACP5 missense variants in a lupus cohort suggests that impaired TRAP functioning 
may increase susceptibility to sporadic lupus.

OBJECTIVE: To study systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the electronic health 
record (EHR), we must accurately identify patients with SLE. Our objective was 
to develop and validate novel EHR algorithms that use International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), Clinical Modification codes, 
laboratory testing, and medications to identify SLE patients.
METHODS: We used Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative, a de-identified version of 
the EHR, with 2.5 million subjects. We selected all individuals with at least 1 
SLE ICD-9 code (710.0), yielding 5,959 individuals. To create a training set, 
200 subjects were randomly selected for chart review. A subject was defined as a 
case if diagnosed with SLE by a rheumatologist, nephrologist, or dermatologist. 
Positive predictive values (PPVs) and sensitivity were calculated for 
combinations of code counts of the SLE ICD-9 code, a positive antinuclear 
antibody (ANA), ever use of medications, and a keyword of "lupus" in the problem 
list. The algorithms with the highest PPV were each internally validated using a 
random set of 100 individuals from the remaining 5,759 subjects.
RESULTS: The algorithm with the highest PPV at 95% in the training set and 91% 
in the validation set was 3 or more counts of the SLE ICD-9 code, ANA positive 
(≥1:40), and ever use of both disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and 
steroids, while excluding individuals with systemic sclerosis and 
dermatomyositis ICD-9 codes.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated the first EHR algorithm that incorporates 
laboratory values and medications with the SLE ICD-9 code to identify patients 
with SLE accurately.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between treatment response, baseline 
biomarker levels, and atacicept exposure in patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) in the phase II/III APRIL-SLE study.
METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of patients who received placebo, 
atacicept 75 mg, or atacicept 150 mg in a randomized, controlled, 52-week trial. 
Serum levels of BlyS and APRIL were measured at baseline, and serum levels of Ig 
and the numbers of naive B cells and plasma cells were measured at baseline and 
during treatment. Atacicept exposure was determined by assessment of the serum 
trough concentrations throughout the 52-week trial period. Associations between 
these parameters, treatment response (reduction in British Isles Lupus 
Assessment Group A or B flare), and infection rates were explored.
RESULTS: Recurrent high baseline levels of both BLyS (≥1.6 ng/ml) and APRIL 
(≥2.2 ng/ml) correlated with a greater treatment response (flare rate 75.7% with 
placebo, and 50.0% and 32.0% with atacicept 75 mg and atacicept 150 mg, 
respectively) compared with lower baseline levels of both. Increased atacicept 
exposure correlated with reduced flare rates (60.5% with placebo; 63.4%, 61.0%, 
48.8%, and 29.3% in the 4 quartiles, from lowest to highest atacicept exposure). 
Greater pharmacodynamic responses (reduced Ig levels and naive B cell and plasma 
cell numbers) were associated with greater reductions in the flare rate. 
Infection rates were similar regardless of biomarker levels at baseline or at 
the time of atacicept exposure.
CONCLUSION: These post hoc analyses demonstrate a dose-response relationship 
between atacicept concentrations, reduced Ig levels, and reduced flare rates and 
suggest that baseline biomarkers such as elevated serum levels of BLyS and APRIL 
may help to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from atacicept 
treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with blood concentrations of 
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and its major metabolite, N-desethylhydroxychloroquine 
(DHCQ), in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; lupus) receiving 
long-term oral HCQ treatment.
METHODS: SLE patients who had been taking HCQ for more than 3 months were 
recruited. Various clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and SLE Disease 
Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores were examined. The concentrations of HCQ and DHCQ 
([HCQ] and [DHCQ]) were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and 
the relationship between [HCQ], [DHCQ], and [HCQ]:[DHCQ] ratio to various 
factors was investigated.
RESULTS: In total, 189 SLE patients receiving long-term HCQ treatment were 
included in the analysis. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) [HCQ] was 515 
(IQR 353-720) ng/ml, the median [DHCQ] was 417 (IQR 266-591) ng/ml, and the 
median [HCQ]:[DHCQ] ratio was 1.3 (range 1.0-1.7). [HCQ] was closely associated 
with [DHCQ] (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001). The weight-adjusted oral HCQ dose was 
strongly associated with both [HCQ] (P < 0.001) and [DHCQ] (P < 0.001). Time 
since last dose was associated with [HCQ] (P < 0.001). No statistically 
significant association was found between renal function or smoking and [HCQ] or 
[DHCQ]. Use of additional immunosuppressants increased both [HCQ] and [DHCQ] 
after adjusting for possible confounders (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively). 
The lower SLEDAI score was significantly related to higher [HCQ], after 
adjusting for age, sex, weight-adjusted HCQ dose, time since last dose, number 
of other immunosuppressants, and smoking status (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Various factors affected blood levels of [HCQ], [DHCQ], or the 
[HCQ]:[DHCQ] ratio of SLE patients receiving long-term oral HCQ treatment. 
Notably, higher [HCQ] was associated with a lower SLEDAI score in our typical 
outpatient clinic population with lupus.

INTRODUCTION: Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (or Kikuchi-Fujimoto 
disease) frequently occurs in Asian young adult females and typically presents 
as cervical lymphadenopathy with unknown etiology. Although large immunoblasts 
frequently appear in Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, the diffuse infiltration of these 
cells can cause difficulty in establishing a differential diagnosis from 
lymphoma. In such cases, CD30 immunostaining may be used; however, the extent or 
distribution pattern of CD30-positive cells in Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease remains 
largely unknown. Here we investigated the expression of CD30 and its 
clinicopathologic significance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 30 Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease and 16 
control [6, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); 10, reactive lymphoid 
hyperplasia (RLH)] cases.
RESULTS: The number of CD30-positive cells in Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease was 
significantly more than that in SLE and RLH, and majority of these cells were 
located around necrotic areas. Moreover, double immunohistochemical staining 
showed these CD30-positive cells to be CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells, 
suggesting that activated cytotoxic T cells around necrotic areas are a 
characteristic feature of this disease. Clinicopathologic analysis showed that 
cases with abundant CD30-positive cells were predominantly female with only mild 
symptoms and normal laboratory data.
CONCLUSIONS: In Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease cases, CD30-positive cytotoxic T cells 
were abundant around necrotic areas; this histologic feature may be helpful to 
differentiate this disease from SLE and RLH.

Objective Inflammation secondary to autoantibody-mediated effects occurring in 
multiple organs is a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The 
inflammatory response to SLE-mediated damage in brain parenchyma has been 
postulated in both normal and cognitively impaired individuals. Our goal is to 
use molecular imaging to investigate the distribution within the brain of the 
mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) that is upregulated during glial cell 
activation, and is considered as a marker of brain injury and repair. Methods We 
sought to characterize TSPO distribution in the brain of SLE patients using 
positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]DPA-713 (DPA), a radiopharmaceutical 
that targets TSPO. We imaged 11 healthy controls and 10 patients with SLE (years 
of diagnosis: 13.0 ± 7.7), all between the ages of 22 and 52.
RESULTS: Among the nine brain regions studied, no statistically significant 
increases in DPA binding were observed in SLE. Instead, there was a significant 
decrease in TSPO distribution in the cerebellum and hippocampus of SLE patients, 
as compared to healthy controls. Such decreases were most significant in 
cognitively normal SLE subjects, but showed pseudo-normalization in those with 
cognitive impairment, due to higher cerebellar and hippocampal DPA binding in 
the cognitively impaired (versus normal) SLE brain. Conclusions Results from 
this pilot study suggest a link between diminished regional TSPO expression in 
the brain of patients with SLE, as well as possible glial cell activation within 
the cerebellum and hippocampus of cognitively impaired individuals with SLE. 
Further studies are needed to elucidate how mitochondrial dysfunction and glial 
cell activation may act together in SLE and SLE-mediated neurocognitive 
deficits.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease with 
potentially severe clinical manifestation that mainly affects women of 
child-bearing age. Patients who do not respond to standard-of-care therapies, 
such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, require biologic therapeutics 
that specifically target a single or multiple SLE pathogenesis pathways. This 
review summarizes the clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
characteristics of biologic agents that are approved, used off-label, or in the 
active pipeline of drug development for SLE patients. Depending on the type of 
target, the interacting biologics may exhibit linear (non-specific) or 
non-linear (target-mediated) disposition profiles, with terminal half-lives 
varying from approximately 1 week to 1 month. Biologics given by subcutaneous 
administration, which offers dosing flexibility over intravenous administration, 
demonstrated a relatively slow absorption with a time to maximum concentration 
of approximately 1 day to 2 weeks and a variable bioavailability of 30-82 %. The 
population pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies were best described by a 
two-compartment model with central clearance and steady-state volume of 
distribution ranging from 0.176 to 0.215 L/day and 3.60-5.29 L, respectively. 
The between-subject variability in pharmacokinetic parameters were moderate 
(20-79 %) and could be partially explained by body size. The development of 
linked pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models incorporating SLE disease 
biomarkers are an attractive strategy for use in dosing regimen simulation and 
optimization. The relationship between efficacy/adverse events and biologic 
concentration should be evaluated to improve clinical trial outcomes, especially 
for biologics in the advanced phase of drug development. New strategies, such as 
model-based precision dosing dashboards, could be utilized to incorporate 
information collected from therapeutic drug monitoring into 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models to enable individualized dosing in real 
time.

Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is a rare, severe multisystem 
autoimmune disease affecting the kidney (Lupus Nephritis, LN) in up to 80% of 
children. LN is more severe in children than adults, with potential for 
irreversible kidney damage requiring dialysis or transplant. Renal biopsy is 
currently the gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring LN, however, it is 
invasive and associated with complications. Urine biomarkers have been shown to 
be better than serum biomarkers in differentiating renal disease from other 
organ manifestations. Over the past decade, there have been an increasing number 
of studies investigating specific candidate biomarkers implicated in the 
pathogenesis of LN or screening for urinary biomarkers using hypothesis free 
methods. In this review, developments in urine biomarkers for LN will be 
reviewed, highlighting those that are of relevance to children and have gone 
through validation in independent international patient cohorts, bringing them 
close to clinical translation.

The relationship between primary hematologic disease and rheumatologic 
manifestations is well known, especially acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, 
plasma cell dyscrasias and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Currently, more has 
been described about autoimmune manifestations in chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia (CMML). Many different clinical scenarios may lead a patient with 
MDS/CMML initially to seek a rheumatological unit. Autoimmune features such as 
polymyalgia rheumatic symptoms, myositis, neutrophilic dermatosis, cutaneous 
vasculitis and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are some examples of 
clinical presentation of MDS/CMML. Moreover, peripheral cytopenias are a common 
initial presentation both for systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and MDS/CMML. 
The aim of this study was to describe a case of an elderly woman with 
thrombocytopenia and positivity of antibodies to anti-extractable nuclear 
antigens (anti-ENA) as initial manifestation of CMML mimicking SLE, and to 
present some clues that encourage the clinician to perform a bone marrow study 
in such a clinical scenario.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the association of adipokines and tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNFα) and its receptors with characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) and to investigate the correlation between adipokines and the TNF system.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six SLE women, aged ≥18 years old, were 
assessed. TNFα, soluble TNFα receptors 1 (sTNFR1) and 2 (sTNFR2) and adipokines 
were analyzed by ELISA kits.
RESULTS: The median (IQR) of age was 41.5 (33.0-49.7) years old and of disease 
duration 11.3 (7.8-15.8) years. The median (IQR) of disease activity was 0 (0-4) 
and of damage index was 2 (1-3). Higher levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were 
associated with nephritis (p < 0.001 for both), and sTNFR1 (p = 0.025) and TNFα 
(p = 0.014) were positively associated with arthritis. Higher sTNFR1 levels were 
found in participants that were not using antimalarial drugs (p = 0.04). 
Independent correlation was found between sTNFR1 (β = 0.253; p = 0.003) and 
sTNFR2 (β = 0.297; p < 0.001) levels and disease activity and damage index 
(sTNFR1: β = 0.367; p < 0.001; sTNFR2: β = 0.335; p < 0.001). Higher adiponectin 
levels were independently associated with nephritis (p = 0.009) and antimalarial 
drugs use (p = 0.015). There was a positive correlation between leptin and 
sTNFR2 levels (p = 0.002) and between resistin levels and sTNFR1 (p < 0.001) and 
sTNFR2 (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The correlation between adipokines and TNF system allows a better 
understanding of the role of adipokines in the inflammatory response in SLE 
patients.

In 2012, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) group 
published a new set of classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE). Studies applying these criteria to real-life scenarios have found either 
equal or greater sensitivity and equal or lower specificity to the 1997 ACR 
classification criteria (ACR 97). Nonetheless, there are no studies that have 
used the SLICC 12 criteria to investigate the incidence of lupus. We used the 
resource of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify incident SLE patients 
in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1993 to 2005, who fulfilled the ACR 97 or 
SLICC 12 criteria. A total of 58 patients met criteria by SLICC 12 and 44 
patients met criteria by ACR 97. The adjusted incidence of 4.9 per 100,000 
person-years by SLICC 12 was higher than that by ACR 97 (3.7 per 100,000 
person-years, p = 0.04). The median duration from the appearance of first 
criterion to fulfillment of the criteria was shorter for the SLICC 12 than for 
ACR 97 (3.9 months vs 8.1 months). The higher incidence by SLICC 12 criteria 
came primarily from the ability to classify patients with renal-limited disease, 
the expansion of the immunologic criteria and the expansion of neurologic 
criteria.

Objective The treatment algorithm for new onset systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) is less well defined than for other rheumatic diseases. We examined the 
treatment patterns in an inception cohort of SLE patients over the first three 
years of disease between 2000 and 2010. Methods Patients fulfilled the American 
College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE within 12 months of 
enrollment and completed three subsequent annual visits. Data collection 
included patient demographics, SLE manifestations, medications, SLE disease 
activity index-2K (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating 
Clinics/American College of Rheumatology damage index. Analysis included 
descriptive statistics and repeated measures mixed models. Results Seventy-nine 
patients, 83.5% female and 91.1% Caucasian were studied. At baseline the mean 
(SD) age was 40.6 (16.4) years, disease duration was 0.36 (0.28) years and 
SLEDAI-2K was 5.7 (4.6). Over three years, cumulative use of corticosteroids, 
antimalarials and immunosuppressants was 53.2%, 77.2% and 40.5% respectively. 
Corticosteroids were usually used in combination with antimalarials and/or 
immunosuppressants. Between baseline and final assessments the use of 
corticosteroids fell (44.3% vs 15.2%) in contrast to antimalarials (55.7% vs 
70.9%) and immunosuppressants (26.6% vs 34.2%). Of 44/79 (55.7%) patients not 
receiving corticosteroids at baseline 84.1% remained off corticosteroids for the 
study duration. Thirty-seven of 79 (46.8%) patients never received 
corticosteroids and only 5/79 (6.3%) at all four assessments. Patients taking 
corticosteroids at baseline had higher mean (SD) daily dose and cumulative dose 
over three years compared with patients not on corticosteroids at baseline (9.0 
(0.8) vs 0.3 (1.3) mg; 10.8 (8.5) vs 0.3 (1.2) g). As a group, SLE patients who 
used corticosteroids either at baseline, at any time in the three year study or 
in high cumulative doses had the highest average disease activity scores over 
the same time frame and had a significant fall in SLEDAI-2K scores ( p < 0.05) 
compared with patients not exposed to corticosteroids. Conclusion Use of 
corticosteroids occurred in approximately half of new onset SLE, usually in 
combination with antimalarials and/or immunosuppressants. It was associated with 
both higher disease activity at baseline and improvement over time. Patients who 
did not receive corticosteroids at presentation were unlikely to do so over the 
next three years.

INTRODUCTION: We report an unusual observation of central nervous system (CNS) 
lymphoma in a 60-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and fatal 
outcome.
OBSERVATION: The patient had systemic erythematosus lupus for 7 years, treated 
with mycophenolate mofetil and developed lymphocytic meningitis in 
2015 associated to the presence of EBV in the cerebrospinal fluid and a necrotic 
vermis' lesion. Diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma was histologically confirmed 
from stereotaxic biopsy, shortly before she died from neurological 
complications.
CONCLUSION: Even though the current association is unusual, lymphocytic 
meningitis with hypoglycorrachia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus 
may reveal CNS lymphoma and diagnosis confirmation requires stereotaxic biopsy 
in order not to delay specific therapeutic management.

We report a case of drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) secondary to 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) in a patient with underlying 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The initial presentation was with febrile 
pleural and pericardial effusions followed by cardiac tamponade. The patient was 
treated with a short course of corticosteroids with complete resolution of 
symptoms. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of TMP/SMX-induced 
DILE presenting with life-threatening serositis. When confronted with sterile 
exudative effusions, clinicians should strongly consider non-infectious 
etiologies.

Objective The objective of this paper is to develop novel classification 
criteria to distinguish between unclear systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 
mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) cases. Methods A total of 205 variables 
from 111 SLE and 55 MCTD patients were evaluated to uncover unique molecular and 
clinical markers for each disease. Binomial logistic regressions (BLRs) were 
performed on currently used SLE and MCTD classification criteria sets to obtain 
six reduced models with power to discriminate between unclear SLE and MCTD 
patients that were confirmed by receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve. 
Decision trees were employed to delineate novel classification rules to 
discriminate between unclear SLE and MCTD patients. Results SLE and MCTD 
patients exhibited contrasting molecular markers and clinical manifestations. 
Furthermore, reduced models highlighted SLE patients exhibiting prevalence of 
skin rashes and renal disease while MCTD cases show dominance of myositis and 
muscle weakness. Additionally decision tree analyses revealed a novel 
classification rule tailored to differentiate unclear SLE and MCTD patients 
(Lu-vs-M) with an overall accuracy of 88%. Conclusions Validation of our novel 
proposed classification rule (Lu-vs-M) includes novel contrasting 
characteristics (calcinosis, CPK elevated and anti-IgM reactivity for U1-70K, 
U1A and U1C) between SLE and MCTD patients and showed a 33% improvement in 
distinguishing these disorders when compared to currently used classification 
criteria sets. Pending additional validation, our novel classification rule is a 
promising method to distinguish between patients with unclear SLE and MCTD 
diagnosis.

This report evaluates the effects of blisibimod (A-623, AMG 623), a potent and 
selective inhibitor of B-cell activating factor (BAFF), on patient-reported 
fatigue and disease activity in the Phase 2b PEARL-SC clinical trial in patients 
with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A total of 547 individuals who met the 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE, were 
positive for anti-double-stranded DNA or antinuclear antibodies, and had a 
Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) score ≥6 at baseline, were 
randomized to receive placebo or blisibimod for at least 24 weeks. Patient 
self-reported fatigue was evaluated using the Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale, and disease activity was evaluated using 
Physician's Global Assessment, SELENA-SLEDAI, and British Isles Lupus Assessment 
Group Score. Statistically significant improvements in FACIT-Fatigue score were 
observed among individuals randomized to blisibimod, especially in the 200 mg QW 
group where favorable effects on disease activity with blisibimod compared to 
placebo were observed as early as Week 8. The mean improvement from baseline of 
6.9 points at Week 24, compared with 4.4 points with placebo, met the criteria 
for minimal clinically important improvement difference defined for patients 
with SLE. Despite concomitant improvements in FACIT-Fatigue, SLE Responder Index 
(SRI) and SLE biomarkers (reported previously), FACIT-Fatigue score correlated 
only weakly with disease activity. While poor correlation between fatigue and 
disease activity is not new, the observation that correlation remains poor 
despite concurrent population improvements in disease and fatigue brings a new 
facet to our understanding of SLE.

Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) is commonly prescribed for autoimmune diseases such as 
systemic lupus erythematosus. We report a case of a 75-year-old female 
presenting with de novo decompensated heart failure and restrictive 
cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction: 40%-45%) after treatment 
with HQ for more than 11 years. Hydroxychloroquine was discontinued, and 
follow-up echocardiogram 57 days after discontinuation showed normalization of 
her left ventricular ejection fraction. A score of 7 on the Naranjo Adverse Drug 
Reaction Probability Scale indicates that HQ is a probable cause of this 
patient's cardiomyopathy. An adverse drug effect due to HQ should be considered 
in treated patients who present with restrictive cardiomyopathy. Discontinuation 
may allow for partial or complete reversal of the cardiomyopathy.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multiorgan autoimmune disease of unknown 
etiology with many clinical manifestations. We report the first case of SLE in 
which visual alterations were evaluated with multichannel perimetry. Some 
achromatic and color vision alterations may be present in SLE, especially when 
treated with hydroxychloroquine. The sensitivity losses detected in the 
chromatic channels in the central zone of the visual field were consistent with 
the results of the FM 100 Hue color test. Likewise, the multichannel perimetry 
detected sensitivity losses in the parafoveal area for both chromatic channels, 
especially for the blue-yellow.

El lupus eritematoso sistémico (LES) es una enfermedad autoinmune multiorgánica 
de etiología desconocida, con muchas manifestaciones clínicas. Reportamos el 
primer caso de LES en el que se evaluaron las alteraciones visuales utilizando 
la perimetría multicanal. En el LES pueden presentarse ciertas alteraciones 
acromáticas y de la visión del color, especialmente cuando se trata la 
enfermedad con hidroxicloroquina. Las pérdidas de sensibilidad detectadas en los 
canales cromáticos de la zona central del campo visual fueron consistentes con 
los resultados de la prueba de color FM 100 Hue. De igual modo, la perimetría 
multicanal detectó pérdidas de sensibilidad en el área parafoveal para ambos 
canales cromáticos, y en especial para el azul-amarillo.

OBJECTIVE: There is little follow-up data in preterm infants from mothers with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of this study was to determine 
maternal outcomes and compare neonatal outcomes in preterm and term infants born 
to mothers with SLE.
METHODS: This study is a prospective study in a tertiary medical care center and 
clinical research center for rheumatoid arthritis. Demographic data, clinical 
features, laboratory findings, treatment and complications in 77 pregnant SLE 
patients were prospectively evaluated from 2007 to 2013.
RESULTS: Ninety-two infants (44 males and 48 females including four sets of 
twins) from 77 mothers with SLE were enrolled. Multivariate logistic analysis 
indicated that flares were significantly associated with antiphospholipid 
antibodies of lupus anticoagulant during pregnancy (p = 0.009) and preterm birth 
(p = 0.017). Compared with term infants, preterm infants had significantly 
higher antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positivity (p = 0.001) at 12 months of age 
in multivariate logistic analysis.
CONCLUSION: Preterm birth is associated with maternal flares and persistent ANA 
positivity at 12 months of life in infants born to mothers with SLE.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of C5a in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric 
systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) and lupus nephritis (LN).
METHODS: Sera were obtained from 29 patients with NPSLE, 25 with LN, 26 without 
NPSLE or LN [SLE alone], and 21 healthy donors. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 
obtained from 29 NPSLE patients. C5a and C5 were measured by ELISA. Blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) function was evaluated by Q albumin ([CSF albumin/serum 
albumin] × 103).
RESULTS: Serum C5a, but not C5, was significantly increased in SLE compared with 
healthy control. Serum C5a, but not C5, was significantly higher in NPSLE and in 
LN than in SLE alone. Serum C4, but not C3, was lower in LN than in NPSLE. Q 
albumin was significantly higher in diffuse NPSLE than in focal NPSLE, whereas 
there were no significant differences in CSF or serum C5a between both groups. 
Notably, CSF C5 and C5a were significantly correlated with Q albumin, whereas 
serum C5a, but not C5, appeared to be inversely correlated with Q albumin.
CONCLUSION: These results disclosed that serum C5a was elevated not only in 
NPSLE but also in LN through different mechanisms. Moreover, it is suggested 
that C5a might be consumed during BBB damages.

    Mod Rheumatol. 2017 Mar;27(2):191-192.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore the characteristics of 
brain MRI abnormalities in acute confusional state (ACS) in neuropsychiatric 
systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE).
METHODS: Thirty-six patients with ACS admitted to our institutions from 1992 to 
2015 were exhaustively enrolled. Their medical charts and brain MRI scans were 
reviewed.
RESULTS: Eighteen of 36 ACS patients had MRI abnormalities, mostly 
high-intensity lesions of various sizes in the cerebral white matter. MRI 
abnormalities improved after treatment in 12 of 14 patients in follow-up 
studies. MRI abnormalities were not correlated with ages at the onset of ACS, 
disease durations of SLE, the presence of anti-DNA, anti-phospholipid or 
anti-ribosomal P antibodies, or IL-6 levels in sera or cerebrospinal fluid. 
Notably, MRI abnormalities were significantly associated with the presence of 
serum anti-Sm antibodies (p = 0.0067). Finally, eight of the 18 patients with 
MRI abnormalities, but none of the other 18 patients without MRI abnormalities, 
died from active SLE. Thus, MRI abnormalities significantly increased the 
mortality in ACS (p = 0.0013, HR =10.36 [95% CI: 2.487-43.19]).
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that patients with ACS with MRI 
abnormalities have more severe diseases, resulting in poorer prognoses. The data 
also indicate that anti-Sm is involved in the development of MRI abnormalities 
in ACS.

Medical Center, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

Objective This study aimed to systemically review the evidence regarding the 
relationship between circulating blood osteopontin (OPN) level and systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), correlation between serum OPN levels and SLE 
activity, and association between OPN polymorphisms and SLE susceptibility. 
Methods We conducted a meta-analysis on the serum/plasma OPN levels in SLE 
patients and healthy controls, correlation coefficients between the circulating 
OPN level and SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) in SLE patients, and the 
association between OPN polymorphisms and SLE risk. Results Nine studies with 
1938 SLE patients and 3037 controls were included. Meta-analysis revealed that, 
compared with the control group, the OPN level was significantly higher in the 
SLE group (SMD = 0.965, 95% CI = 0.337-1.393, p = 0.001) and in the SLE group 
with renal disease (SMD = 2.219, 95% CI = 0.681-3.757, p = 0.005). Meta-analysis 
of correlation coefficients showed a trend of positive correlation between the 
circulating OPN level and SLEDAI (correlation coefficient = 0.590, 95% 
CI = -0.025 to 0.881, p = 0.059). While no association was found between SLE and 
the OPN 707 T/C and 1083 G/A polymorphisms, a significant association was 
identified between the OPN 1239 C allele and SLE (OR = 1.192, 95% 
CI = 1.008-1.410, p = 0.040), and between the OPN 9250 C allele and SLE in 
Asians (OR = 2.070, 95% CI = 1.570-2.730, p = 2.5 × 10-7). Conclusions Our 
meta-analysis revealed a significantly higher circulating OPN level in SLE 
patients, a trend of positive correlation between OPN levels and SLE activity, 
and a significant association between OPN 1239 C/A and 9250 C/T polymorphisms, 
and SLE development.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has a complex clinical picture, and a number 
of defects in the immune system have been described in patients with the 
disease. Most organs can be involved in SLE, and in addition to the typical 
major organ manifestations (e.g. from kidneys and the central nervous system), 
early cardiovascular disease is a major determinant of prognosis. Several 
important findings during the last decade have increased the understanding of 
the mechanisms behind the disease characteristics and the underlying autoimmune 
process. Amongst, these are defects in the handling of apoptotic cells, 
increased expression of type I interferon-regulated genes and activation of 
autoreactive B cells, with both the type I interferon system and the B 
lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) having key roles. In addition, a large number of 
genes have been identified that contribute to these abnormalities. It has also 
become clear that certain SLE risk genes are associated with some organ 
manifestations, such as STAT4 with nephritis and IRF8 with myocardial 
infarction. Furthermore, environmental factors that can induce SLE or trigger a 
disease flare have been identified. As a consequence of this increased 
knowledge, new treatments for SLE have been developed. The most recently 
approved drug for SLE is belimumab, which blocks BLyS, and several new therapies 
and therapeutic strategies are in the pipeline for clinical application.

Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran3 Rheumatology Research 
Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of applying the 
continuous care model (CCM) on the knowledge level and health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and their 
perceptions of family awareness about the disease.
DESIGN: The Continuous Care Model (CCM) was implemented for 3 months on 34 SLE 
patients, in a pretest-posttest quasiexperimental design.
METHODS: Two sets of questionnaires were designed for knowledge assessment. 
HRQoL was assessed by SF-36 questionnaires. Analysis was by paired t test and 
one-way ANOVA.
FINDINGS: The continuous care model significantly improved patients' knowledge 
level and their perceptions of their family members' awareness of their disease. 
HRQoL status in SLE patients was poorer than the general population in six of 
eight SF-36 scales (p < .05), except for Bodily Pain and Mental Health. 
Postintervention scores showed improvement in six SF-36 scales (p < .001), 
except for Bodily Pain and Social Functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results underlined the advantages of applying the CCM as a 
comprehensive method of self-care in SLE.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Despite many improvements in SLE care, the patients' quality 
of life is still much affected by SLE. Implementation of the CCM could lead to 
improvement in the knowledge and HRQoL of SLE patients.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a female predominant 
autoimmune disease. The autoreactive B cells and T helper cells together are 
known to develop adverse immune responses in different tissues like kidney, 
bone, cardiovascular and central nervous system. Progression of disease is 
associated with deposition of immune complex which initiates tissue damage. The 
therapy for lupus still includes corticosteroids to reduce allergic 
manifestations and inflammatory immune responses. Recent observations suggested 
that, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide treatment in combination with 
corticosteroids have benefit in lupus therapy.
METHOD: The prospect of B cell depletion by CD20 targeted monoclonal antibody 
Rituximab has been demonstrated in lupus patients. The CD52 specific monoclonal 
antibody Alemtuzumab is another proposition for lupus therapy. The drug 
Belimumab inhibits B cell activation by altering BAFF/APRIL signal cascade. 
Recent discovery of the CD22 targeted Epratuzumab also shows therapeutic 
prospect. The researches on new generation drugs for autoimmune lupus include 
search for inhibitors of CD40- CD40Ligand interactions, CD86 activation, 
selective modulation of complement cascades. The choice of inhibitors of 
transcription factor NF-κBp65 and selective modulators for estrogen receptor 
alpha are proposed areas of lupus drug discovery research.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Keeping a close eye on the mechanisms of disease onset, a 
comprehensive view is provided on recent therapy of systemic lupus 
erythematosus.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics, outcome and predictive factors of 
juvenile mixed connective tissue disease (JMCTD) in a nationwide cohort of 
patients.
METHODS: We examined 55 patients with JMCTD after a mean disease duration of 
16.2 years (SD 10.0). Patients were registered according to Kasukawa's criteria. 
Remission criteria were defined according to those for juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, plus absence of cytopenia, myositis, progressive sclerodactyly, lung 
and oesophageal manifestations. Organ damage was assessed with the Systemic 
Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index and the Juvenile Arthritis Damage Index (JADI). 
Medical records were reviewed for early predictors for outcome, which were 
assessed by multivariate logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Three patients developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Fifty-two 
patients had continuous JMCTD; the most common manifestations were: Raynaud 
(100%), arthritis (94%), puffy hands (77%) and pulmonary manifestations (58%). 
SLE-like, systemic sclerosis (SSc)-like and polymyositis (PM)-like findings were 
found in 98%, 77% and 48%, respectively. Over time, SLE-like and PM-like 
manifestations decreased, and SSc-like findings increased. At follow-up, 35 
patients (67%) had active disease and 17 (33%) were in remission. In 34 patients 
(65%), SLICC or JADI≥1 assessments indicated organ damage. Active disease was 
associated with higher anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody titres at follow-up and 
positive rheumatoid factor (RF) at diagnosis and follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with JMCTD had active disease and organ damage after 
a mean follow-up of 16.2 years. Active disease was associated with higher 
anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody levels and positive RF. The presence of RF at 
diagnosis predicted persistent disease activity.

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether measures of vitamin D were associated with 
transitioning to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in individuals at risk for 
SLE.
METHODS: 436 individuals who reported having a relative with SLE but who did not 
have SLE themselves were evaluated at baseline and again an average of 6.3 
(±3.9) years later. Fifty-six individuals transitioned to SLE (≥4 cumulative 
American College of Rheumatology criteria). 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels 
were measured by ELISA. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in four vitamin D 
genes were genotyped. Generalised estimating equations, adjusting for 
correlation within families, were used to test associations between the vitamin 
D variables and the outcome of transitioning to SLE.
RESULTS: Mean baseline 25[OH]D levels (p=0.42) and vitamin D supplementation 
(p=0.65) were not different between those who did and did not transition to SLE. 
Vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D <20 ng/mL) was greater in those who transitioned 
compared with those who did not transition to SLE (46% vs 33%, p=0.05). The 
association between 25[OH]D and SLE was modified by CYP24A1 rs4809959, where for 
each additional minor allele increased 25[OH]D was associated with decreased SLE 
risk: zero minor alleles (adjusted OR: 1.03, CI 0.98 to 1.09), one minor allele 
(adjusted OR: 1.01, CI 0.97 to 1.05) and two minor alleles (adjusted OR: 0.91, 
CI 0.84 to 0.98). Similarly, vitamin D deficiency significantly increased the 
risk of transitioning to SLE in those with two minor alleles at rs4809959 
(adjusted OR: 4.90, CI 1.33 to 18.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D status and CYP24A1 may have a combined role in the 
transition to SLE in individuals at increased genetic risk for SLE.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether urinary monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1) could serve as a biomarker for lupus nephritis (LN).
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between 
urinary MCP-1 level and LN in three comparisons: active LN versus inactive LN, 
active LN versus control, and inactive LN versus control.
RESULTS: Eight studies of a total of 399 patients with LN (204 with active LN, 
and 195 with inactive LN) and 130 controls were available for this 
meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that the urinary MCP-1 level was 
significantly higher in the active-LN group than in the inactive-LN group 
(standard mean difference [SMD] = 1.883, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 
0.811-2.954, p = 0.001). The meta-analysis showed that the urinary MCP-1 level 
was significantly higher in the active-LN group than in the control group (SMD = 
3.085, 95 % CI = 1.684-4.485, p = 1.6 × 10-5). Furthermore, stratification by 
ethnicity showed significantly elevated urinary MCP-1 levels in the active-LN 
group in Caucasian, Asian, and Egyptian populations (SMD = 2.408, 95 % CI = 
1.711-3.105, p < 1.0 × 10-8; SMD = 1.020, 95 % CI = 0.623-2.153, p = 4.6 × 10-7; 
and SMD = 7.370, 95 % CI = 1.467-2.157, p = 5.9 × 10-5, respectively). The 
meta-analysis indicated that the urinary MCP-1 level was also significantly 
higher in the inactive-LN group than in the control group (SMD = 1.812, 95 % 
CI = 0.628-2.996, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis demonstrated that urinary MCP-1 was significantly 
higher in patients with active LN than in those with inactive LN and control 
subjects, and the patients with inactive LN showed significantly higher urinary 
MCP-1 levels than the controls.

OBJECTIVE: Moderate alcohol consumption has antiinflammatory properties and is 
associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis risks. 
We investigated the association between alcohol consumption and systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) risk among women followed in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) 
cohorts.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort analysis among 204,055 women in NHS 
(1980-2012) and NHSII (1989-2011) who were free of connective tissue disease and 
provided alcohol information at baseline. Alcohol consumption was assessed using 
a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 2-4 years. We validated 
incident SLE through medical record review after self-report. Cox proportional 
hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for SLE based on cumulative average 
alcohol intake, adjusting for potential confounders. Results were meta-analyzed 
using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models. We further investigated SLE 
risk associated with wine, beer, and liquor intake.
RESULTS: We identified 125 incident SLE cases in NHS and 119 in NHSII. Mean ± SD 
age at SLE diagnosis was 55.8 ± 9.5 years in NHS and 43.4 ± 7.7 years in NHSII. 
Compared to no alcohol intake, the meta-analyzed multivariable HR for cumulative 
alcohol consumption ≥5 gm/day was 0.61 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 
0.41-0.89). When limiting alcohol exposure to >4 years prior to SLE diagnosis, 
the multivariable HR was similar: 0.61 (95% CI 0.41-0.91). Women who drank ≥2 
servings/week of wine had significantly decreased SLE risk (HR 0.65, 95% CI 
0.45-0.96) compared to women who did not drink wine.
CONCLUSION: In these large prospective cohorts, we demonstrated an inverse 
association between moderate alcohol consumption (≥5 grams or 0.5 drink/day) and 
SLE risk in women.

The aim of this study is to assess the long-term safety of allogeneic umbilical 
cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC MSCs) transplantation for patients with 
refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Nine SLE patients, who were 
refractory to steroid and immunosuppressive drugs treatment and underwent MSCs 
transplantation in 2009, were enrolled. One million allogeneic UC MSCs per 
kilogram of body weight were infused intravenously at days 0 and 7. The possible 
adverse events, including immediately after MSCs infusions, as well as the 
long-term safety profiles were observed. Blood and urine routine test, liver 
function, electrocardiogram, chest radiography and serum levels of tumor 
markers, including alpha fetal protein (AFP), cancer embryo antigen (CEA), 
carbohydrate antigen 155 (CA155) and CA199, were assayed before and 1, 2, 4 and 
6 years after MSCs transplantation. All the patients completed two times of MSCs 
infusions. One patient had mild dizzy and warm sensation 5 min after MSCs 
infusion, and the symptoms disappeared quickly. No other adverse event, 
including fluster, headache, nausea or vomit, was observed. There was no change 
in peripheral white blood cell count, red blood cell count and platelet number 
in these patients after followed up for 6 years. Liver functional analysis 
showed that serum alanine aminotransferase, glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase, 
total bilirubin and direct bilirubin remained in normal range after MSCs 
infusions. No newly onset abnormality was detected on electrocardiogram and 
chest radiography. Moreover, we found no rise of serum tumor markers, including 
AFP, CEA, CA125 and CA199, before and 6 years after MSCs infusions. Our 
long-term observational study demonstrated a good safety profile of allogeneic 
UC MSCs in SLE patients.

A 65-year-old woman had undergone a thymectomy for thymoma and 1 year after 
surgery she developed scattered erosive erythema with scaling and crusting. 
Examination findings exhibited the elevation of anti-dsDNA antibody, 
anti-desmoglein 1 antibody, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody and 
anti-thyroglobulin antibody. A skin biopsy showed intraepidermal blisters 
containing neutrophils and acantholytic keratinocytes and direct 
immunofluorescence revealed the deposition of immunoglobulin G in the epidermis 
and on the basement membrane. These findings indicated the presence of systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), myasthenia gravis, pemphigus foliaceus and chronic 
thyroiditis. Only 1% of SLE patients have three other autoimmune diseases 
according to previous publications. Our case is rare because she suffered four 
autoimmune diseases after the thymectomy.

BACKGROUND: Patients with full-house nephropathy (FHN) present renal lesions 
that are indistinguishable from those of lupus nephritis (LN) but lack the 
systemic features necessary to meet diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus 
erithematosus (SLE). Some have been reported to develop a delayed SLE with time. 
The clinical outcome of children having FHN without SLE has never been reported.
METHODS: Children with biopsy-proven FHN were selected after excluding SLE cases 
by the absence of America College of Rheumatology criteria. The proportion of 
patients with complete (proteinuria <0.5 g/day) or partial remission 
(proteinuria ≤50% from baseline), relapse (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
<25% and/or proteinuria ≥50% from baseline) and progression to Stage III chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) was described according to age and gender groups with the 
Kaplan-Meier curve and compared with the Log-rank test. Entity of treatment was 
summarized by a score at induction (0-6 months) and maintenance (6-18 months). 
Cox-regression model was performed to test predictors of remission, relapse and 
progression to CKD.
RESULTS: Among 42 patients (28 pre-pubertal) who met the inclusion criteria, 39 
(92.9%) achieved partial and 32 (76.2%) complete remission of nephropathy over 
2.78 and 7.51 months of follow-up. At 10 years, the probability of progressing 
to CKD was 4.8%. Of those achieving remission, 18% had a renal flare mainly 
within 4 years after remission. Pre-pubertal males achieved complete remission 
more frequently than other patients but often relapsed; pre-pubertal females 
were treated more aggressively. Cox-regression analysis did not find independent 
predictors of remission or relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of the patients with FHN we investigated was 
encouraging. Recurrences are limited to the first 4 years following diagnosis, 
allowing progressive withdrawal of immunosuppression in patients achieving 
remission. Evaluation of risk factors for adverse outcome is necessary 
especially in pre-pubertal children.

Hydroxychloroquine is used in the long-term therapy of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). Although considered to be a safe treatment, side effects 
have been documented. An uncommon side effect is thrombocytopenia. In order to 
establish the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia secondary to Hydroxychloroquine, 
non-pharmacological causes must be ruled out and it is necessary to determine a 
recurrence after re-exposure to the drug. We present one case of severe 
thrombocytopenia occurring in a patient with SLE undergoing treatment with 
Hydroxychloroquine.

INTRODUCTION: Several case reports have reported the benefit of intravenous 
immunoglobulin therapy in many autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus 
erythematosus.
CASE REPORTS: Here, we report on two cases of lupus myocarditis treated with 
high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin. The first patient was a 42-year-old 
woman who presented with lupus myocarditis that was resistant to corticosteroids 
and cyclophosphamide, and who was finally successfully treated with a single 
dose of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient displayed clinical 
improvement a few days later. The second case - a 43-year-old woman was 
diagnosed with lupus myocarditis and immunosuppressive drugs were 
contraindicated because of the context of a recent infective endocarditis. She 
was treated with repeated dose of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin. Clinical 
improvement was observed and the left ventricular ejection fraction increased 
from 20 % to 60 % within a few days. We also report 9 similar observations 
identified from a literature review.
CONCLUSION: The use of intravenous immunoglobulin in lupus myocarditis is not 
officially recognized but could be considered as an alternative when 
conventional therapies have failed or are contraindicated.

OBJECTIVES: Lupus imposes a substantial burden on patients; however, little is 
known about its impact on those caring for patients with the disease. In this 
study, we examined the impact 'caring for patients with lupus' has on caregivers 
from their own perspective.
METHODS: UNVEIL was a one-time online national cross-sectional survey developed 
in partnership with the Lupus Foundation of America and fielded targeting the US 
Lupus Foundation of America constituents in 2014. Eligible caregivers were 
adults who self-identified as unpaid caregivers of patients with lupus. Eligible 
caregivers had to complete a series of sociodemographic questions as well as a 
series of well established outcome measures, such as the Short Form 12v2 Health 
Survey, the Work Productivity and Activity Index, the Caregiver Burden 
Inventory, and the Perceived Benefits of Caregiving Scale.
RESULTS: A total of 253 caregivers completed the survey. The majority of 
caregivers (90.1%) were aged 60 years or younger, more than half (54.2%) were 
men, and more than half (59.7%) identified themselves as either a spouse or a 
partner to the patient with lupus they were caring for. Overall health-related 
quality of life was close to the norm mean of the general US population. 
Caregivers who were employed missed an average of 12.8% of paid work time due to 
caregiving responsibilities and reported a 33.5% reduction in on-the-job 
effectiveness. Nearly half of the caregivers surveyed (49.4%) indicated that 
their caregiving responsibilities impacted their ability to socialize with 
friends, and almost all caregivers (97.6%) reported experiencing increased 
anxiety and stress in relation to their caregiving role.
CONCLUSIONS: Caregiving for patients with lupus has a substantial impact on the 
work productivity and the social and emotional functioning of caregivers. 
Healthcare professionals and policymakers should continually assess the impact 
of healthcare decisions on the well-being of those caring for patients with 
lupus.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor. 
Less is known about cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and the risk of 
developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, we investigated the risk of 
mortality and adverse cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with SLE and 
CLE. We conducted a cohort study of the entire Danish population aged ≥ 18 
and ≤ 100 years, followed from 1997 to 2011 by individual-level linkage of 
nationwide registries. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression models were used to 
estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for a composite cardiovascular endpoint and 
all-cause mortality, for patients with SLE and CLE. A total of 3282 patients 
with CLE and 3747 patients with SLE were identified and compared with 5,513,739 
controls. The overall HR for the composite CVD endpoint was 1.31 (95% CI 
1.16-1.49) for CLE and 2.05 (95% CI 1.15-3.44) for SLE. The corresponding HRs 
for all-cause mortality were 1.32 (95% CI 1.20-1.45) for CLE and 2.21 (95% CI 
2.03-2.41) for SLE. CLE and SLE were associated with a significantly increased 
risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. Local and chronic inflammation may be the 
driver of low-grade systemic inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a key regulator of 
both atherosclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), yet factors leading 
to its overproduction remain unclear. To explore regulation of MIF in SLE, we 
studied effects and potential mechanisms of type I interferon (IFN) and 
artesunate (ART), an antimalarial agent extracted from Chinese herbs, on levels 
of MIF.
METHODS: Serum and peripheral blood cells from SLE patients and healthy controls 
were measured for MIF levels by ELISA and type I IFN-inducible gene expressions 
by real-time PCR, respectively, and assessed for associations by Spearman 
correlation. ART was added to human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) 
cultures with or without prior IFNα-1b stimulation and to SLE peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures. Protein levels of STATs and phosphorylated 
(p-) STATs in HUVECs were determined by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Serum MIF levels were elevated in SLE patients and positively 
associated with disease activity (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001), accumulated damage 
(r = 0.34, p < 0.05), and IFN scores in SLE PBMCs (r = 0.74, p = 0.0002). The 
addition of IFNα-1b promoted MIF production in a time- and dose-dependent manner 
in HUVEC cultures. ART could inhibit expressions of IFN-inducible genes (LY6E 
and ISG15) in both HUVEC and SLE PBMC cultures, and suppress MIF production and 
over-expression of p-STAT1, but not p-STAT3 or STAT5, induced by IFNα-1b 
stimulation. IFNγ-induced expression of p-STAT1 in HUVECs was not inhibited by 
ART.
CONCLUSION: MIF could be regulated by type I IFN in SLE patients. ART 
counteracts the effect of IFNα to inhibit MIF production by blocking STAT1 
phosphorylation and thus may have therapeutic potential for SLE-associated 
atherosclerosis.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine whether early discoid 
lupus erythematosus (DLE) would be a protective factor for further lupus 
nephritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: We studied SLE patients from GLADEL, an inception longitudinal cohort 
from nine Latin American countries. The main predictor was DLE onset, which was 
defined as physician-documented DLE at SLE diagnosis. The outcome was time from 
the diagnosis of SLE to new lupus nephritis. Univariate and multivariate 
survival analyses were conducted to examine the association of DLE onset with 
time to lupus nephritis.
RESULTS: Among 845 GLADEL patients, 204 (24.1%) developed lupus nephritis after 
SLE diagnosis. Of them, 10 (4.9%) had DLE onset, compared to 83 (12.9%) in the 
group of 641 patients that remained free of lupus nephritis (hazard ratio 0.39; 
P = 0.0033). The cumulative proportion of lupus nephritis at 1 and 5 years since 
SLE diagnosis was 6% and 14%, respectively, in the DLE onset group, compared to 
14% and 29% in those without DLE (P = 0.0023). DLE onset was independently 
associated with a lower risk of lupus nephritis, after controlling for 
sociodemographic factors and disease severity at diagnosis (hazard ratio 0.38; 
95% confidence interval 0.20-0.71).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that DLE onset reduces the risk of further lupus 
nephritis in patients with SLE, independently of other factors such as age, 
ethnicity, disease activity, and organ damage. These findings have relevant 
prognosis implications for SLE patients and their clinicians. Further studies 
are warranted to unravel the biological and environmental pathways associated 
with the protective role of DLE against renal disease in patients with SLE.

BACKGROUND: African American ethnicity is independently associated with lupus 
myocarditis compared with other ethnic groups. In the mixed racial population of 
the Western Cape, South Africa, no data exists on the clinical features/outcome 
of lupus myocarditis.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to give a comprehensive description 
of the clinical features and outcome of acute lupus myocarditis in a mixed 
racial population.
METHODS: Clinical records (between 2008 and 2014) of adult systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) patients at a tertiary referral centre were retrospectively 
screened for a clinical and echocardiographic diagnosis of lupus myocarditis. 
Clinical features, laboratory results, management and outcome were described. 
Echocardiographic images stored in a digital archive were reanalysed including 
global and regional left ventricular function. A poor outcome was defined as 
lupus myocarditis related mortality or final left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) <40%.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 457 lupus patients (6.1%) met inclusion criteria: 92.9% 
were female and 89.3% were of mixed racial origin. Fifty-three per cent of 
patients presented within three months after being diagnosed with SLE. 
Seventy-five per cent had severely active disease (SLE disease activity 
index ≥ 12) and 67.9% of patients had concomitant lupus nephritis. Laboratory 
results included: lymphopenia (69%) and an increased aRNP (61.5%). Treatment 
included corticosteroids (96%) and cyclophosphamide (75%); 14% of patients 
required additional immunosuppression including rituximab. Diastolic dysfunction 
and regional wall motion abnormalities occurred in > 90% of patients. LVEF 
improved from 35% to 47% (p = 0.023) and wall motion score from 1.88 to 1.5 
(p = 0.017) following treatment. Overall mortality was high (12/28): five 
patients (17.9%) died due to lupus myocarditis (bimodal pattern). Patients who 
died of lupus myocarditis had a longer duration of SLE (p = 0.045) and a lower 
absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.041) at diagnosis. LVEF at diagnosis was lower 
in patients who died of lupus myocarditis (p = 0.099) and in those with a 
persistent LVEF < 40% (n = 5; p = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest reported series on lupus myocarditis. The mixed 
racial population had a similar prevalence, but higher mortality compared with 
other ethnic groups (internationally published literature). Patients typically 
presented with high SLE disease activity and the majority had concomitant lupus 
nephritis. Lymphopenia and low LVEF at presentation were of prognostic 
significance, associated with lupus myocarditis related mortality or a 
persistent LVEF < 40%.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder with a 
broad spectrum of clinical presentations and association with multiple 
immunological abnormalities. Recent research of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway-revealed 
aberrant STAT signaling in inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases 
including SLE. STAT proteins are major components in interferon (IFN)-dependent 
gene expression and are responsible for signal transduction of over 50 
cytokines, hormones, and growth factors regulating key cellular processes such 
as survival, proliferation, and differentiation. This review summarizes the 
present evidence from experimental animal models and patients with SLE for the 
involvement of STAT pathways in the pathogenesis of SLE underlining the role of 
different members of the STAT family. Genome-wide association studies provided 
evidence that variations in STAT4 gene are linked to the development of SLE in 
humans. First integration with genome-wide epigenomics data suggests that 
control of CD4+ T cell differentiation in which STATs play a major role may be 
an important component of the genetic contribution to disease susceptibility. 
Increased transcript and total protein STAT1 levels were described both in SLE T 
and B cells suggestive of the priming mechanisms that augment STAT1 signaling 
responses to IFN. STAT3 has a crucial role in Th17 differentiation, T follicular 
helper, and B cells, and STAT3 inhibition could represent a possible future 
therapeutic target in SLE. STAT5B appears to act as a critical modulator of 
human Treg development and function. While the imbalance between phosphorylated 
STAT5 and STAT3 in human SLE T cells was implicated in dysregulated IL-10 
expression, Treg-specific deletion of STAT3 in mouse model even enhanced 
Th17-mediated inflammation. Finally, we present also a comprehensive analysis of 
studies investigating STAT signaling responses in conventional and regulatory 
subsets of SLE T and B cells and possible implications of STAT inhibition for 
clinical therapy.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which any 
organs can be potential targets of autoimmune aggression. Although the 
pathogenic auto-antibodies have been well characterized, the role of B cells 
goes far beyond that of antibodies production, and B cell-targeted therapy may 
be an interesting therapeutic approach. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody 
rituximab has been successfully used to control the most severe form of SLE, and 
even if two controlled clinical trials failed to demonstrate its superiority 
compared to conventional immunosuppressants, off-label use of rituximab is still 
commonly adopted in clinical practice in SLE nephritis resistant to 
immunosuppressants. Different protocols have stipulated heterogeneous dosages 
but all of them included repeated injections of the drug, exposing the patient 
to the risk of adverse reactions and to tachyphylaxis (loss of the therapeutic 
effect). Stimulation of the host's immune system to develop a CD20 
antigen-specific immune response by means of CD20-mimotope molecules may offer 
an approach that can overcome these drawbacks. This study provides a critical 
overview of vaccination therapy in rheumatic diseases and reports the design of 
a vaccination strategy in (New Zealand Black/New Zealand White) F1 SLE-prone 
mice using CD20-mimotope peptides. By week 47, this vaccine induces a B- cell 
depletion by 74 % (cell number, mean ± SD, 0.57 ± 0.38) as compared to week 29 
(2.19 ± 0.55) (p = 0.005) and prolongs survival in peptide-treated mice (median, 
46.71 weeks; 95 % CI, 39.78-53.64) as compared to the control group (median 
39.85; 95 % CI, 37.41-42.30) (Kaplan-Meier p = 0.002), although no differences 
between the peptide group and control group were detected in terms of 
proteinuria and auto-antibodies titers. These data indicate the feasibility of 
this approach, and the mouse model described here may be useful to optimize 
vaccination protocol and to define the mechanism(s) underlying B- cell 
depletion.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the links between 
ethnicity, serology and clinical expression in systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) in a single cohort that was followed over a 36-year period.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with SLE treated at the University College London 
Hospitals (UCLHs) between January 1978 and December 2013 formed the cohort. We 
assessed the demographic, clinical and serological data. Standard methods were 
used for laboratory testing. The Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were 
used for the continuous variables; the Fisher's exact test was used for the 
categorical variables.
RESULTS: We studied 624 SLE patients: There were 571 women (91.5%), with a mean 
age at diagnosis of 29.0 ± 6.5 years; and 53 men (8.5%), with a mean age at 
diagnosis of 29.4 ± 15.3 years. Ethnically, 369 of the patients were European, 
100 were Afro-Caribbean, 77 were East Asian, 56 were South Asian and 21 were of 
mixed ethnicity. The East Asian patients developed the disease at a younger age 
than the other ethnic groups (p < 0.0001). The Afro-Caribbean patients were less 
frequently associated with the presence of rash and photosensitivity, and the 
non-European patients were more likely to have alopecia and renal involvement. 
The South Asian patients were significantly associated with musculoskeletal and 
neurological involvement, serositis, Sicca syndrome and hematological features. 
The Afro-Caribbean patients had the highest prevalence of anti-Smith, anti-RNP, 
anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Anti-IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies were 
significantly associated with the non-East Asian groups; and hypocomplementemia 
was common in the East Asians. Rash, alopecia, mouth ulcers, serositis, 
neurological, joint and renal involvement were significantly associated with the 
presence of anti-Smith and anti-RNP antibodies in the Afro-Caribbean group. We 
also observed an association of joint involvement and the presence of anti-Ro 
and anti-La antibodies in this group.
CONCLUSIONS: The East Asian patients developed their SLE disease at a younger 
age than the other ethnic groups. Cutaneous involvement was more frequent in 
those who were not Afro-Caribbean. Serositis, joint and neurological involvement 
were more frequently diagnosed in the South Asian patients. Anti-ENA antibodies 
were frequently associated with the Afro-Caribbean patients.

OBJECTIVE: The phenotype of patients who remain naive of glucocorticosteroids 
has not been described, and the type and rate of their damage accrual remains 
largely unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the type, amount, 
rate, and nature of organ damage accrual, mortality, and atherosclerotic 
comorbidities in glucocorticosteroid-naive and glucocorticosteroid-exposed 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: Inception patients from the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic who had 
never taken glucocorticosteroids and had a minimum of 3 years of followup were 
compared to patients who received glucocorticosteroids within the first 6 months 
of SLE diagnosis and for at least 3 years. All patients had no damage at 
inception.
RESULTS: A total of 86 glucocorticosteroid-naive and 173 
glucocorticosteroid-exposed patients were included. There were more females and 
whites among the glucocorticosteroid-naive patients, whereas the 
glucocorticosteroid-exposed patients had higher Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
Disease Activity Index 2000 scores on first examination. Overall mortality was 
higher in the glucocorticosteroid-exposed group, but the deaths occurred late. 
There was no difference in the frequency of coronary artery disease overall or 
at each of the time points. Damage accrual was higher in 
glucocorticosteroid-exposed patients overall and at 5 and 8 years. Individual 
damage items that were higher in glucocorticosteroid-exposed patients included 
ocular (cataracts) and musculoskeletal (osteoporosis with fragility fractures, 
and osteonecrosis) components.
CONCLUSION: Mortality is more frequent in patients taking glucocorticosteroids 
for at least the first 3 years of their lupus compared to patients who are 
glucocorticosteroid-naive. In addition, patients taking glucocorticosteroids 
accumulate more damage by 5 years of disease, and damage tends to be 
glucocorticosteroid related, including cataracts and musculoskeletal components.

OBJECTIVES: During the last years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have 
identified a number of common genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the genetic overlap between 
these two immune-mediated diseases has not been thoroughly examined so far. The 
aim of the present study was to identify additional risk loci shared between RA 
and SLE.
METHODS: We performed a large-scale meta-analysis of GWAS data from RA (3911 
cases and 4083 controls) and SLE (2237 cases and 6315 controls). The 
top-associated polymorphisms in the discovery phase were selected for 
replication in additional datasets comprising 13 641 RA cases and 31 921 
controls and 1957 patients with SLE and 4588 controls.
RESULTS: The rs9603612 genetic variant, located nearby the COG6 gene, an 
established susceptibility locus for RA, reached genome-wide significance in the 
combined analysis including both discovery and replication sets (p 
value=2.95E-13). In silico expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed 
that the associated polymorphism acts as a regulatory variant influencing COG6 
expression. Moreover, protein-protein interaction and gene ontology enrichment 
analyses suggested the existence of overlap with specific biological processes, 
specially the type I interferon signalling pathway. Finally, genetic correlation 
and polygenic risk score analyses showed cross-phenotype associations between RA 
and SLE.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have identified a new risk locus shared between 
RA and SLE through a meta-analysis including GWAS datasets of both diseases. 
This study represents the first comprehensive large-scale analysis on the 
genetic overlap between these two complex disorders.

PURPOSE: To evaluate tear film osmolarity in patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: A total of 55 eyes from 55 patients with SLE and 47 eyes from 47 age- 
and gender-matched healthy individuals were included in this study. Tear film 
osmolarity was evaluated with a lab-on-a-chip technique (TearLab; TearLab 
Corporation, San Diego, CA) in SLE patients in comparison with healthy 
individuals, and results were correlated to clinically available diagnostic 
tests for dry eye, such as tear ﬁlm break-up time (BUT), Schirmer's test, and 
Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI).
RESULTS: The mean tear film osmolarity in the SLE patients and healthy 
individuals was 306.02 ± 13.27 mOsm/L and 300.74 ± 9.11 mOsm/L, respectively, 
which made for a statistically significant difference (p = 0.020). In the SLE 
group, tear film osmolarity was negatively correlated with the Schirmer's test 
score and the BUT value (r = -0.295 p = 0.029 and r = 0.347 p = 0.009, 
respectively), whereas tear film osmolarity was not correlated with OSDI score 
(r = -0.182 p = 0.183).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that tear film hyperosmolarity and abnormal 
tear film function are associated with SLE.

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is increased among patients with CTDs. 
The active form of vitamin D (calcitriol) is a potent regulator of the immune 
system and may suppress inflammatory responses. This has led to claims that 
vitamin D may be a safe treatment, or a treatment adjunct, to reduce systemic 
inflammation in this patient population. It is important to note, however, that 
there is insufficient evidence from robust clinical trials to support these 
novel uses for vitamin D. In this review we examine the potential role of 
vitamin D as a treatment adjunct for CTDs. We will discuss how vitamin D may 
modulate the immune response and review the current evidence for using vitamin D 
to treat CTDs and their associated co-morbidities. We conclude that while there 
is much excitement about vitamin D in this context, further well-designed trials 
are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of patients with CTDs.

A 24-year-old female presented with catatonia and symptoms suggestive of 
Depressive Disorder. She also gave history of undocumented low grade irregular 
fever. The patient was worked up to rule out any organic cause or psychiatric 
illness. However, further investigations revealed immunological profile 
diagnostic of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with CNS involvement (CNS 
lupus). The diagnosis of SLE in this patient presenting with catatonia was of 
practical importance because catatonia as one of the manifestations of SLE or as 
a standalone presenting symptom is extremely rare. Hence, clinicians should be 
aware of this rarity so that diagnosis of Neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) or 
catatonia as a presenting feature of SLE is never missed.

OBJECTIVES: To explore differences in body structure and function in systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and controls, with particular reference to 
joint hypermobility, and to evaluate the usefulness of the Brighton criteria for 
diagnosing joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) in SLE.
METHOD: Female SLE patients were, according to age group, consecutively invited 
to participate in the study. Controls were healthy females matched for age. All 
individuals were examined by a physician according to the Brighton criteria, and 
by an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist to obtain the Beighton 
scores, overall joint mobility, and manifestations in body structure and 
function.
RESULTS: Sixteen (23%) SLE patients and 19 (27%) controls had a Beighton score ≥ 
4 (non-significant, ns), and 39 (55%) individuals in the SLE group and 22 (31%) 
in the control group satisfied the Brighton criteria for JHS (p < 0.01). Many 
individuals in both groups exceeded the normative values for joint mobility in 
joints other than those included in the Beighton score. Stratifying for a 
Beighton score ≥ 4 vs. < 4, there were no significant differences in body 
structure or body function constituting JHS either in the SLE patients or in the 
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the presence of joint hypermobility in SLE patients was 
frequent, we could not verify that this caused excess manifestations in addition 
to the SLE symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the mechanisms underlying lupus nephritis (LN) 
amelioration following bortezomib treatment.
METHODS: Bortezomib was administered subcutaneously every 3 days to NZB/W F1 
mice, and the serum anti-double stranded (ds) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
antibody titers and proteinuria levels were measured. The renal samples and the 
splenocytes were examined histologically or used for real-time quantitative 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis after 18 weeks of 
treatment. Serum cytokine and anti-dsDNA antibody levels were measured using 
flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunoassays every 3 weeks. Transforming growth 
factor (TGF)-β, angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R), and type I collagen 
expression levels in the glomeruli were evaluated using immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Bortezomib reduced the serum anti-dsDNA antibody titers and the 
proteinuria levels. It prevented inflammatory cell infiltrations into and the 
deposition of immunoglobulin G within the glomeruli. Bortezomib reduced the 
interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 levels in the serum and the 
ribonucleic acid expression levels for these cytokines within the splenocytes. 
Bortezomib prevented type I collagen synthesis by downregulating TGF-β and AT1R 
expression in the glomeruli.
CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib exerts multiple immunosuppressive effects and thus 
ameliorates LN. Furthermore, bortezomib can prevent glomerulosclerosis formation 
in NZB/W F1 mice through suppressive effects on the renin-angiotensin system.

Background Lupus nephritis is one of the most serious complications of systemic 
lupus erythematosus. This study evaluates the prevalence and correlation between 
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and other biomarkers associated with 
renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus. Methods Paired serum and 
urine specimens from 50 suspected systemic lupus erythematosus patients, 
characterized by antinuclear antibodies detected by indirect immunofluorescence 
assay and varying positive concentrations of anti-double stranded DNA antibodies 
by Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence assay, were investigated. Of these 50 
patients, 18 were identified with renal involvement based upon laboratory 
serology. Patients and healthy control serum samples ( n = 50) were also 
evaluated for high avidity double stranded DNA IgG antibodies, anti-C1q IgG 
antibodies, and serum creatinine. The prevalence and relationship between 
biomarkers were evaluated using statistical methods. Results Serum and urine 
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentrations were significantly 
elevated in patients compared to controls, with a prevalence of 24% and 36%, 
respectively. These concentrations were also more markedly increased in systemic 
lupus erythematosus patients with renal involvement than those without. 
Spearman's correlations between neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and 
other biomarkers tested ranged from 0.06 to 0.66 in all patients. Combined 
concordance as determined by Cronbach alpha coefficient between biomarkers was 
reduced from 0.71 to 0.58 (serum) and 0.62 (urine) when neutrophil 
gelatinase-associated lipocalin was removed. Conclusions Neutrophil 
gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentrations are elevated and demonstrate 
variable associated with other laboratory markers for renal involvement in 
systemic lupus erythematosus. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to 
determine the optimal biomarker combinations for use in routine management of 
systemic lupus erythematosus patients at-risk for lupus nephritis.

Oral isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoinc acid) is a derivative of vitamin A and 
belongs to the first generation of retinoids, which act as synthetic isomers of 
retinoic acid (RA). It is a very effective agent in a treatment of acne 
vulgaris; however, multiple side effects related to therapy with retinoids 
preclude the use of isotretinoin in less severe acne vulgaris. A significant 
limitation for the administration of isotretinoin appears in case of concomitant 
kidney disease with a special attention regarding the safety of the agent in 
patients with lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of this review is an assessment of 
the safety of isotretinoin for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients with 
LN. We searched both MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, as well as several 
dermatological textbooks, to present all limitations and benefits of therapy 
with isotretinoin or its isomer (ATRA) for patients with kidney diseases. 
Several mouse models of SLE revealed a significant modulatory influence of 
retinoids on autoimmune injury of the glomerular unit. Retinoids were 
demonstrated to affect mononuclear cell infiltrations of renal tissue allowing 
for a reduction in the overall glomerular damage. Presumptively, they can affect 
a synthesis of autoantibodies significantly limiting their deposition in the 
glomerular unit. Moreover, retinoids were also shown to affect the synthesis of 
different cytokines specific both for lymphocytes Th1 (IL-2, IL-12, INFγ) ant 
Th2 (IL-4, IL-10). The influence of retinoids on the course of LN seems to be 
more multidimensional than only restricted to immune aspects and these synthetic 
RA isomers manifest also antiproteinuric activity in comparable extent to 
steroidal agents. The agents were demonstrated to counteract a loss of podocytes 
after the injury of the glomerular unit. They can promote a differentiation of 
renal progenitor cells (RPCs) within the Bowman capsule into mature podocytes 
leading to regeneration of podocyte number. Additionally, retinoids can probably 
protect podocytes from injury limiting their apoptosis, as well as reducing foot 
process effacement. Although, an endogenous production of RA isomers increases 
after the injury of the glomerular unit aiming to the restoration of podocyte 
number, it can be significantly impaired by a loss of albumins into urine. RA 
isomers are progressively sequestered by albumin within the Bowman's space and 
therefore, they are quickly eliminated with urine. It was demonstrated that the 
administration of exogenous RA isomers (retinoids) can bypass the activity of 
albumins enhancing the regeneration of podocytes. Finally, retinoids can 
regulate the production of vasoactive substances influencing on different 
vascular functions in the kidney. They can beneficially change a balance of 
angiotensin metabolites through by down-regulation of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme type 1 and the enhancement of an expression of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme type 2. Another studies revealed that retinoids could also alter the 
activity of renal endothelin pathway; however, the significance of this effect 
requires further elucidation. Taken all these presented effects of retinoids in 
the kidney into consideration, we can conclude that isotretinoin can be the safe 
treatment option of acne vulgaris in patients with LN.

AIM: Lupus nephritis (LN) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 
and hence usually treated aggressively with immunosuppressants. This predisposes 
LN patients to increased infections, yet few studies have evaluated LN patients 
for infective complications. We aimed to describe the epidemiology and identify 
risk factors for infections requiring hospitalization among patients with 
biopsy-proven LN.
METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of patients with 
biopsy-proven LN between 1 January 2000 and 31 May 2009. Patients were excluded 
if they were <16 years old at time of biopsy, had previous kidney transplant or 
if pharmacotherapy data were incomplete. Hospitalizations for infections, 
bacteraemia and polymicrobial infections were recorded until patients' last 
visit or when they received immunosuppression for non-glomerulonephritis 
indications, such as solid organ transplant or chemotherapy.
RESULTS: We studied 189 patients who had biopsy-proven lupus nephritis. Median 
age at diagnosis was 36.9 (IQR: 27.4, 47.5) years and 82% were female. Most 
patients received at least one immunosuppressant after LN diagnosis, including 
glucocorticosteroids in 94.2%. One hundred and four patients (60.3%) had at 
least one hospitalization for infection at 11 (1, 53) months from diagnosis. 
Bacteraemia occurred in 26 patients (13.8%) and 32 patients (16.9%) had 
polymicrobial infections. On multivariate analysis, LN relapse was associated 
with hospitalization for infection (OR 2.33 (1.18, 4.60), P = 0.01) and 
bacteraemia (OR 3.47 (1.05, 11.45), P = 0.04). Infection-related mortality 
occurred in 10 patients (5.3%).
CONCLUSION: Serious infections are common among patients with LN and are 
associated with mortality.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), but there is no consensus on the role of serum vitamin D in 
evaluating or predicting disease activity. This study aimed to demonstrate the 
direct correlation between vitamin D level and pediatric-onset SLE disease 
activity by a retrospective cohort study design.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with pediatric-onset SLE and paired 
sera at the active and inactive disease states were enrolled. Disease activity 
was defined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000, and 
active lupus nephritis (LN) was defined as active urine sediment, and 
proteinuria >2+ on stick or >500 mg/day. All data were reviewed and calculated 
from previous medical records. The levels of both vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 were 
checked by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.
RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) levels in the active status were 
significantly lower compared to that in inactive disease status 
(12.0 ± 7.2 ng/mL vs. 15.4 ± 7.4 ng/mL, p = 0.005). A subgroup analysis revealed 
that at active disease status, patients with LN had lower 25-OH D levels than 
patients without LN (16.3 ± 8.2 ng/mL vs. 9.8 ± 5.6 ng/mL, p = 0.023). Moreover, 
there is a significant inverse correlation between serum 25-OH D levels and 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 at both inactive 
(r = -0.335, p = 0.003) and active (r = -0.373, p = 0.016) disease status.
CONCLUSION: Serum vitamin D levels are inversely correlated with SLE disease 
activity at both active and inactive disease status, and also with the presence 
of LN at active disease stage.

Health-related quality of life in systemic lupus erythematosus: a longitudinal 
study on the impact of problematic support and self-efficacy.

OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease 
which can affect any organ in the body, reducing patients' health-related 
quality of life (HR-QOL). Psychosocial research on SLE is quite recent and is 
mostly based on qualitative and cross-sectional evidence. Some studies suggest 
that a protective role is played by perceived self-efficacy in the management of 
the disease, while a detrimental role is played by problematic social 
interactions.
METHODS: In a longitudinal study, we tested the independent contribution of 
self-efficacy and problematic social support, in predicting patients' HR-QOL 
after 11 months. An online questionnaire was completed by 162 participants with 
SLE, the second questionnaire after 11 months.
RESULTS: Controlling for corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine use, 
self-efficacy in the management of the disease at Time 1 showed a significant 
and positive effect on HR-QOL at Time 2, while problematic social support 
(denying/uninformed) showed a negative effect.
CONCLUSIONS: HR-QOL of SLE patients is influenced by self-efficacy in the 
management of the disease and problematic support. Specific attention should be 
paid to the quality of patients' social relationships and their perceived 
efficacy in the management of the disease in focused interventions as in daily 
clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: To validate the pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System short forms (PROMIS-SFs) in childhood-onset systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) in a clinical setting.
METHODS: At 3 study visits, childhood-onset SLE patients completed the 
PROMIS-SFs (anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, physical 
function-mobility, physical function-upper extremity, pain interference, and 
peer relationships) using the PROMIS assessment center, and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) legacy measures (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 
Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, Simple Measure of Impact of Lupus 
Erythematosus in Youngsters [SMILEY], and visual analog scales [VAS] of pain and 
well-being). Physicians rated childhood-onset SLE activity on a VAS and 
completed the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000. Using a 
global rating scale of change (GRC) between study visits, physicians rated 
change of childhood-onset SLE activity (GRC-MD1: better/same/worse) and change 
of patient overall health (GRC-MD2: better/same/worse). Questionnaire scores 
were compared in support of validity and responsiveness to change (external 
standards: GRC-MD1, GRC-MD2).
RESULTS: In this population-based cohort (n = 100) with a mean age of 15.8 years 
(range 10-20 years), the PROMIS-SFs were completed in less than 5 minutes in a 
clinical setting. The PROMIS-SF scores correlated at least moderately (Pearson's 
r ≥ 0.5) with those of legacy HRQoL measures, except for the SMILEY. Measures of 
childhood-onset SLE activity did not correlate with the PROMIS-SFs. 
Responsiveness to change of the PROMIS-SFs was supported by path, mixed-model, 
and correlation analyses.
CONCLUSION: To assess HRQoL in childhood-onset SLE, the PROMIS-SFs demonstrated 
feasibility, internal consistency, construct validity, and responsiveness to 
change in a clinical setting.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a safe, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
method to measure regional blood-brain barrier integrity and investigate its 
relationship with neurocognitive function and regional gray matter volume in 
juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, case-control study, capillary permeability was 
measured as a marker of blood-brain barrier integrity in juvenile SLE patients 
and matched healthy controls, using a combination of arterial spin labeling and 
diffusion-weighted brain MRI. Regional gray matter volume was measured by 
voxel-based morphometry. Correlation analysis was done to investigate the 
relationship between regional capillary permeability and regional gray matter 
volume. Formal neurocognitive testing was completed (measuring attention, 
visuoconstructional ability, working memory, and psychomotor speed), and scores 
were regressed against regional blood-brain barrier integrity among juvenile SLE 
patients.
RESULTS: Formal cognitive testing confirmed normal cognitive ability in all 
juvenile SLE subjects (n = 11) included in the analysis. Regional capillary 
permeability was negatively associated (P = 0.026) with neurocognitive 
performance concerning psychomotor speed in the juvenile SLE cohort. Compared 
with controls (n = 11), juvenile SLE patients had significantly greater 
capillary permeability involving Brodmann's areas 19, 28, 36, and 37 and caudate 
structures (P < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSION: There is imaging evidence of increased regional capillary 
permeability in juvenile SLE patients with normal cognitive performance using a 
novel noninvasive MRI technique. These blood-brain barrier outcomes appear 
consistent with functional neuronal network alterations and gray matter volume 
loss previously observed in juvenile SLE patients with overt neurocognitive 
deficits, supporting the notion that blood-brain barrier integrity loss precedes 
the loss of cognitive ability in juvenile SLE. Longitudinal studies are needed 
to confirm the findings of this pilot study.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether socioeconomic status assessed by education is 
associated with disease activity and the risk of organ damage in systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: Data from the 1000 Canadian Faces of Lupus, a multicenter database of 
adult SLE patients, was used to compare education as either low (did not 
complete high school) or high (completed high school or further) for disease 
activity and damage. Education was also studied as a continuous variable. The 
relationships between education and SLE outcomes (any organ damage defined as a 
Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of 
Rheumatology Damage Index [SDI] score ≥1, serious organ damage [SDI score ≥3], 
and end-stage renal disease) were evaluated using logistic regression analyses 
adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and disease duration.
RESULTS: A total of 562 SLE patients met inclusion criteria (mean age 47 years, 
91% female, and mean disease duration of 10 years); 81% had high education. The 
low education group was twice as likely to be work disabled (30%; P < 0.0001); 
they had higher disease activity and reduced renal function. Linear regression 
analysis revealed that low education was significantly associated with higher 
disease activity at enrollment into the 1000 Canadian Faces of Lupus database, 
after adjustment for age (at entry and at diagnosis), race/ethnicity, and sex (B 
1.255 + 0.507 [SE], β = 0.115, P = 0.014). In our adjusted logistic regression 
models we were unable to demonstrate significant associations between education 
and SLE damage. Results did not change when varying the education variable.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, low education was associated cross-sectionally with 
higher disease activity and work disability, but not damage.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical outcome and safety of rituximab (RTX) 
treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with severe 
manifestations or whose disease is refractory to standard immunosuppressive 
therapy, treated at a single center.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all patients with SLE treated with 
RTX at 1 center between June 2000 and December 2013. The clinical outcome was 
assessed by determining British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) scores and 
anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and C3 levels before and 6 months after 
RTX treatment. For safety analysis, adverse events and deaths were recorded.
RESULTS: Of a total of 115 patients, 93.9% were female, the mean ± SD age at 
diagnosis was 26.39 ± 11.90 years, and the mean ± SD disease duration at first 
RTX treatment was 91.96 ± 84.80 months. A BILAG score variation of 
-11.26 ± 11.38 (P < 0.001) was recorded 6 months after the first RTX treatment; 
40% of patients had a complete response and 27% had a partial response; in 36.5% 
of patients, C3 levels increased more than 25%, and in 33.5% anti-dsDNA levels 
decreased more than 50%. Depletion of CD19+ cells was achieved in 94.0% of 
patients. Hypogammaglobulinemia was detected in 14.9% of patients, with 
significant reduction for IgM (P < 0.001) and IgG (P = 0.001) levels. Severe 
infections, infusion-related reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions occurred 
in 7%, 3.5%, and 2.6% of patients, respectively. Of the 115 patients, 62 
patients had repeated RTX treatments, with an average number of 1.95 ± 1.17 
cycles per patient and a mean ± SD interval between infusions of 21.44 ± 20.11 
months. At the end of followup, 11 patients were deceased; 6 had cardiovascular 
events.
CONCLUSION: RTX treatment was effective in decreasing disease activity, with a 
low incidence of adverse effects.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complicated autoimmune disorder 
characterized by autoantibodies production, immune complex formation, and immune 
dysregulation, resulting in damage of multiple organs including the kidney. 
Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common severe manifestation of SLE involving 
the majority of patients. Even though there are a number of reports indicating 
that interleukin-17 (IL-17) and Th17 cells play important roles in the 
pathogenesis of LN, the precise molecular mechanisms underline the development 
of LN have not been totally elucidated. In this review, we briefly summarize 
general characteristics of T and IL-17 cells in SLE. In addition, we discuss in 
detail T cell signaling pathways which control IL-17 production in patients with 
LN and in glomerulonephritis in lupus-prone mice. A better understanding of 
signaling and gene regulation defects in LN will lead to the identification of 
novel therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis 
of this disease.

Heparanase is a β-glucuronidase that cleaves sugar chains of heparan sulfate 
proteoglycans. It is believed that heparanase may be involved in the 
pathogenesis of proteinuria. The aim of this study was to assess the 
significance of heparanase in the pathogenesis of particular glomerulonephritis 
types. The evaluation of heparanase activity in serum, urine, and granulocytes 
and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in granulocytes of patients with lupus 
nephritis (n = 17), membranous nephropathy (n = 11), IgA nephropathy (n = 12), 
focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (n = 18), mesangiocapillary 
glomerulonephritis (n = 12) and in 19 healthy volunteers were performed. The 
heparanase activity in granulocytes of patients with lupus nephritis and 
membranous nephropathy was higher than heparanase activity in granulocytes in 
the control group (p = 0.02 in both cases). This is the first observation of 
this phenomenon. There was no difference between SOD activity in granulocytes of 
patients with all assessed types of glomerulonephritis and the control group. A 
positive correlation between heparanase activity in urine and double-strain DNA 
antibodies (r = 0.51; p = 0.04), and reverse correlations between heparanase in 
urine and hemolytic activity of the complement (r = -0.57; p = 0.03) in the 
lupus nephritis group, and between heparanase activity in granulocytes and serum 
total protein level (r = -0.69; p = 0.02) in membranous nephropathy were 
observed. Increase in heparanase activity without changes in superoxide 
dismutase activity in the granulocytes from patients with lupus nephritis and 
membranous nephropathy was observed. It may be used as one of the markers of 
these disease activities.

We report our experience using catheter-directed thrombectomy/thrombolysis (CDT) 
to treat a patient with acute renal vein thrombosis (RVT) associated with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A 34-year-old woman presented with 
persistent left flank pain, and a renal ultrasonography examination revealed an 
enlarged left kidney. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed the 
presence of acute left RVT. Because medical treatment failed to relieve her pain 
and the renal function was deteriorating, we attempted to salvage the occluded 
left renal vein using an endovascular approach. The pain was completely relieved 
after a CDT and an overnight urokinase infusion. A follow-up computed tomography 
examination revealed the complete resolution of the thrombus. The creatinine 
level returned to normal (1.7-0.4 mg/dL), along with contrast enhancement in the 
left kidney, and this suggested the preservation of renal function. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report utilizing CDT to treat SLE-associated RVT. 
When the renal function is deteriorating, CDT is worth considering for RVT if 
conventional medical treatment has failed. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

OBJECTIVES: To determine and compare the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency 
and deficiency in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with and 
without disease activity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a comparative, observational, cross-sectional, 
prospective study of 137 women with SLE according to American College of 
Rheumatology criteria. Patients with chronic kidney disease, cancer, 
hyperparathyroidism, pregnancy, and lactation were excluded. Disease activity 
was assessed using the MEX-SLEDAI score: a score of ≥3 was considered as disease 
activity. Data were collected on diabetes mellitus, the use of corticosteroids, 
chloroquine, and immunosuppressants, photoprotection and vitamin D 
supplementation. Vitamin D levels were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay: 
insufficiency was defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30ng/ml and deficiency 
as <10ng/ml.
RESULTS: 137 women with SLE (mean age 45.9±11.6 years, disease duration 7.7±3.4 
years) were evaluated. Mean disease activity was 2 (0-8): 106 patients had no 
disease activity and 31 had active disease (77.4% versus 22.6%). Vitamin D 
insufficiency and deficiency was found in 122(89.0%) and 4 (2.9%) patients, 
respectively. There was no significant difference in vitamin D levels between 
patients with and without active disease (19.3±4.5 versus 19.7±6.8; P=.75). No 
correlation between the MEX-SLEDAI score (P=.21), photosensitivity, 
photoprotection, prednisone or chloroquine use and vitamin D supplementation was 
found.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with SLE had a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficient. No 
association between vitamin D levels and disease activity was found.

BACKGROUND: The increase of circulating urokinase plasminogen activator receptor 
(suPAR) was demonstrated in various diseases showing its prognostic value as 
well as the link to the inflammatory reaction. In glomerular diseases, suPAR was 
considered a causative factor of proteinuria. In the present study we aimed to 
evaluate serum concentration of suPAR in children with primary and secondary 
glomerulonephritis (GN) and its association with disease severity.
METHODS: The study involved 22 children with minimal change disease (MCD), nine 
with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), seven with 
Henoch-Schönlein nephritis, seven with lupus nephritis (LN) and 16 controls.
RESULTS: Serum suPAR was significantly higher in children with FSGS and LN than 
controls (4.47±1.39 ng/mL vs. 3.23±0.76 ng/mL; P=0.011 and 6.17±1.12 ng/mL vs. 
3.23±0.76 ng/mL, respectively; P<0.0001). Further, suPAR was increased in LN 
when compared to FSGS (P=0.031). In the total group suPAR showed negative 
correlation with eGFR, serum complement C3 and positive with left ventricular 
mass index. In children with MCD and FSGS the inverse association of suPAR with 
eGFR was also shown.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with primary and secondary glomerulonephritis suPAR 
levels are not associated with proteinuria. In primary GN elevated suPAR levels 
may result from reduced eGFR reflecting renal damage. In LN circulating suPAR 
can be increased further indicating both multi-organ involvement and systemic 
inflammation reflecting disease severity.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether B‑cell lymphocyte kinase (BLK) 
polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) in ethnically diverse populations.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of the association between the BLK 
rs13277113 A/G, rs2736340 T/C, rs2248932 T/C, and rs2618476 G/A polymorphisms 
and SLE.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies with 22,701 patients and 36,365 controls were 
included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed a significant 
association between SLE and the BLK rs13277113 A allele (OR = 1.359, 95 % CI = 
1.292-1.429, p < 1.0 × 10-8), and stratification by ethnicity indicated an 
association between this allele and SLE in Caucasians, Asians, and Africans 
(OR = 1.315, 95 % CI = 1.252-1.380, p < 1.0 × 10-8; OR = 1.415, 95 % CI = 
1.287-1.555, p < 1.0 × 10-8; OR = 1.361, 95 % CI = 1.194-1.550, p = 3.6 × 10-6). 
A significant association between SLE and the rs2736340 T allele (OR = 1.354, 
95 % CI = 1.286-1.426, p < 1.0 × 10-8) was also observed, and stratification by 
ethnicity indicated an association between the risk allele and SLE in Caucasians 
and Asians (OR = 1.333, 95 % CI = 1.259-1.412, p < 1.0 × 10-8; OR = 1.525, 95 % 
CI = 1.339-1.736, p < 1.0 × 10-8). Meta-analysis also revealed a significant 
association between SLE and the BLK alleles rs2248932 T and rs2618476 G (OR = 
1.285 95 % CI = 1.228-1.345, p < 1.0 × 10-8; OR = 1.374, 95 % CI = 1.294-1.468, 
p < 1.0 × 10-8), and stratification by ethnicity indicated an association 
between these alleles and SLE in Caucasians and Asians.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirms that polymorphisms in the BLK alleles 
rs13277113 A/G, rs2736340 T/C, and rs2248932 T/C are associated with 
susceptibility to SLE in Caucasian and Asian populations.

Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder 
characterized by immune dysregulation and formation of autoantibodies. A high 
index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose SLE. Children have more systemic 
involvement than adults. Kidney involvement is seen in a significant proportion 
of children. With advancement of therapy the survival rate of patients with SLE 
has significantly improved. Even then lupus nephritis is still the most 
important predictor of morbidity and mortality. Treatment of lupus nephritis is 
mostly derived from studies in adults as data on children is still lacking. 
Prednisolone and cyclophosphamide was the mainstay of treatment till now. 
Recently drugs like mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, rituximab are also 
being used in treatment of lupus nephritis with promising results and without 
significant adverse effects. In this review we will be discussing lupus 
nephritis, its diagnosis, pathogenesis, clinical picture and treatment 
advancements.

INTRODUCTION: The vascular disorders in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
result from various mechanisms and presentations (inflammatory disease or 
vasculitis, atherosclerosis).
CASE REPORT: We report on a 34-year-old man with cutaneous, articular, 
neurological and nephrologic SLE. He presented with catastrophic haemorrhage on 
microaneurysm rupture of the left hepatic artery. After blood transfusions and 
immunosuppressive treatments, his condition improves.
CONCLUSION: Uncommon complication in SLE patients, digestive vasculitis with 
microaneurysms may occur as in polyarteritis nodosa. In the literature, we 
identified 10 additional cases of hepatic microaneurysms in SLE patients. The 
main issue is an earlier diagnosis in order to give appropriate treatment and 
improve prognosis.

Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate at cold temperatures. Their 
presence can be related to a type of vasculitis referred to as cryoglobulinemia. 
This condition, especially mixed cryoglobulinemia, has been associated with 
viral infections like hepatitis C virus in 60%-90% of cases, but it has also 
been reported in relation to connective tissue diseases, usually resulting in a 
more severe course. We describe the case of a patient with seronegative 
polyarthritis who developed acute arterial ischemia in association with 
cryoglobulinemia, with a good response to rituximab therapy.

Lupus nephritis is an important cause of kidney failure in patients of Asian, 
African, or Hispanic descent. Its etiology and pathogenesis are multifactorial 
and remain to be elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests that 
anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies play a critical role in the 
pathogenesis, through its direct binding to cross-reactive antigens on resident 
renal cells or indirect binding through chromatin material to extracellular 
matrix components, resulting in complement activation, cell activation and 
proliferation, and induction of inflammatory and fibrotic processes. While 
tubulo-interstitial damage portends poor long-term renal prognosis, the 
mechanisms leading to tubulo-interstitial injury in lupus nephritis has received 
relatively less attention to date. Immune deposition along the tubular basement 
membrane is often observed in lupus nephritis and correlates with 
tubulo-interstitial infiltration of immune cells and interstitial fibrosis. 
Anti-dsDNA antibodies bind to resident renal cells, including proximal renal 
tubular epithelial cells, and contribute to renal inflammation and fibrosis. 
There is emerging evidence that epigenetic influence such as DNA methylation, 
histone modification, and microRNAs (miRs) also contribute to kidney fibrosis. 
Overexpression of miR-150 is observed in renal biopsies from patients with lupus 
nephritis and correlates with kidney fibrosis and chronicity score. 
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an established and effective standard-of-care 
therapy for patients with lupus nephritis. Accumulating data suggest that in 
addition to its immunosuppressive actions on lymphocyte proliferation, 
mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of MMF, can exert a direct effect 
on nonimmune cells. Mediators of inflammation and fibrosis induced by anti-dsDNA 
antibodies in cultured proximal renal tubular epithelial cells are ameliorated 
by the addition of MPA, suggesting that in addition to its immunosuppressive 
actions, MPA may also have a beneficial effect in improving tubulo-interstitial 
inflammation and fibrosis through its direct action on proximal renal tubular 
epithelial cells.

This report describes the case of a very low-birth-weight male infant with 
neonatal lupus erythematosus. His mother had Sjögren's syndrome, and her 
previous child had suffered a complete heart block. Accordingly, maternal 
steroid (betamethasone) therapy was administered to prevent a congenital heart 
block for 15 weeks (from 13 to 27 weeks' gestation). At 28 weeks' gestation, the 
mother was weaned off the steroid therapy, and an emergency cesarean section was 
carried out at 29 weeks and 6 days' gestation because of a nonreassuring fetal 
status (NRFS). At birth, the infant exhibited grade-III intraventricular 
hemorrhage (IVH). Although it is unclear why the infant developed a NRFS and 
IVH, the condition of the fetus should be carefully monitored during and after 
long-term maternal steroid treatment.

Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the features of heparan 
sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as agrins of the glomerular basement membrane 
(GBM) and circulating anti-heparan sulfate (HS) antibodies in lupus nephritis, 
comparing titers among the following groups: lupus nephritis (LN), non-renal 
lupus, non-lupus nephritis, and healthy controls. Methods The stage of nephritis 
was determined based on the kidney biopsy. Alcian blue staining and 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for agrin were performed for histological 
evaluation of GBM HSPGs in normal glomeruli, non-lupus membranous 
glomerulonephritis (MGN), and lupus MGN. The results were used for measurement 
of the serum anti-HS antibody titers using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) in the following groups: 38 healthy controls, 38 non-lupus nephritis, 37 
non-renal lupus, and 38 LN. Results Glomerulus HSPGs were stained bluish-green 
along the GBM with Alcian blue. However, IHC staining against agrin was almost 
completely negative in the lupus MGN group compared with the normal and 
non-lupus MGN groups, which showed brown staining of GBM. A higher level of 
anti-HS IgG was detected in LN compared with other groups, respectively. Higher 
titers were associated with the presence of SLE and nephritis. A higher degree 
of proteinuria normalized to glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed in 
association with higher anti-HS antibody titers in LN. Conclusion This study 
demonstrated a functional loss of GBM HSPGs and higher levels of circulating 
anti-HS antibodies as a characteristic feature of lupus nephritis, suggesting 
their involvement in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and proteinuria.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous chronic, 
inflammatory autoimmune disorder. The association of MMP-7 and disease severity 
is still unclear. A total of 150 SLE patients and matched healthy controls were 
recruited for this study. Disease activity was scored according to SLEDAI (98 
active and 52 inactive disease). Mean serum MMP-7 levels were significantly 
higher in SLE patients than controls ( p < 0.001). Patients with active disease 
showed higher levels (16.24 ± 6.2 ng/ml) as against inactive disease 
(10.50 ± 3.97 ng/ml) ( p ≤ 0.0001). Mean MMP-7 mRNA expression was significantly 
higher in patients (RQ = 3.16 ± 0.93) as compared to controls (RQ = 2.21 ± 0.89, 
p = 0.006). A positive correlation between MMP-7 levels, mRNA expression and 
SLEDAI score was observed ( r = 0.563, r = 0.427). The MMP-7 -181 G allele was 
found to be significantly higher among SLE patients ( p < 0.0001). A significant 
association was noted between MMP-7 -181 A/G +G/G genotypes with renal ( 
p = 0.0027) and CNS ( p = 0.0031) manifestations and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies ( 
p = 0.0312). Serum MMP-7 levels and mRNA expression were elevated in advanced 
stages of SLE, indicating that MMP-7 is associated with disease activity in SLE.

Objectives The renal activity index for lupus (RAIL) score was developed in 
children with lupus nephritis as a weighted sum of six urine biomarkers (UBMs) 
(neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, 
ceruloplasmin, adiponectin, hemopexin and kidney injury molecule 1) measured in 
a random urine sample. We aimed at prospectively validating the RAIL in adults 
with lupus nephritis. Methods Urine from 79 adults was collected at the time of 
kidney biopsy to assay the RAIL UBMs. Using receiver operating characteristic 
curve analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of the RAIL to discriminate high lupus 
nephritis activity status (National Institutes of Health activity index (NIH-AI) 
score >10), from low/moderate lupus nephritis activity status (NIH-AI score 
≤10). Results In this mixed racial cohort, high lupus nephritis activity was 
present in 15 patients (19%), and 71% had proliferative lupus nephritis. Use of 
the identical RAIL algorithm developed in children resulted in only fair 
prediction of lupus nephritis activity status of adults (area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.62). Alternative weightings of the six 
RAIL UBMs as suggested by logistic regression yielded excellent accuracy to 
predict lupus nephritis activity status (AUC 0.88). Accuracy of the model did 
not improve with adjustment of the UBMs for urine creatinine or albumin, and was 
little influenced by concurrent kidney damage. Conclusions The RAIL UBMs provide 
excellent prediction of lupus nephritis activity in adults. Age adaption of the 
RAIL is warranted to optimize its discriminative validity to predict high lupus 
nephritis activity status non-invasively.

Omics studies of systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) in general, and SLE in 
particular, have delivered isolated information from transcriptome, epigenome, 
genome, cytokine and metabolome analyses. Such analyses have resulted in the 
identification of disease susceptibility genes and the description of IFN 
expression signatures, allowing extensive insight into the mechanisms of disease 
and the development of new therapies. Access to such technologies allows the 
recognition of patterns of disease at a pathway level, thereby, to reclassify 
SLE and other SADs and to develop new therapeutics from a personalized 
perspective. The use of omic information allows the discovery of correlative 
patterns involving drugs not currently suspected to be of value in SADs. In this 
review, we summarize the omics findings for SLE and propose ways of using the 
data for the identification of new biomarkers, finding new drugs and 
reclassifying patients not only with SLE, but also with other SADs.

AIM: Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between the prevalence and 
severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and the anemia in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: This was a case-control study which was conducted at the rheumatology 
clinic of a university affiliated hospital, including 62 patients with SLE and 
62 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The patients were divided into two 
groups in terms of their hemoglobin levels. The criterion for anemia was 
hemoglobin level lower than 12 g/dL in females and 13 g/dL in males.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients (30.6%) in the patient group were diagnosed with RLS, 
and International RLS Study Group Rating Scale (IRLSSG-RS) score was 10.7 ± 9.5 
(median:10.0 [range:0.0-30.0]). Three subjects (4.8%) in the control group had 
RLS, and the IRLSSG-RS score was 0.7 ± 3.3 (median:0.0 [range:0.0-18.0]). The 
prevalence of RLS and the IRLSSG-RS score were higher in the patient group than 
those in the control group (P < 0.001). Ten SLE patients (50%) with anemia had 
RLS, and their IRLSSG-RS score was 14.5 ± 9.9 (median:21.0 [range:11.0-30.0]). 
Nine SLE patients (21.4%) without anemia had RLS and their IRLSSG-RS was 9.0 ± 
8.9 (median:21.0 [range:11.0-24.0]). Significant differences were present in the 
prevalence of RLS and the IRLSSG-RS score between SLE patients with and without 
anemia (P = 0.024, P = 0.044, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that the prevalence of RLS was higher 
in patients with SLE than that of the normal population. Results of this study 
also suggested that anemia was associated with higher frequency of and more 
severe RLS in patients with lupus.

INTRODUCTION: Renal histology of proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) shows 
increased macrophage infiltration, but its association with renal outcome is a 
matter of debate. Here, we investigate the potential relationship that 
macrophage expression has with renal prognosis in patients with proliferative 
LN.
METHODS: Fifty patients newly diagnosed with proliferative LN were followed for 
a median of 8 years. Laboratory testing was conducted at diagnosis, after 
induction therapy and at the final follow-up evaluation. Renal biopsies were 
obtained at diagnosis and underwent immunohistochemical analysis with anti-CD68 
and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 monoclonal antibodies. Patients were 
stratified at final follow-up evaluation into glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
>60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (non-progressor group; n = 24) and GFR ≤60 ml/min/1.73 m2 
(progressor group; n = 26). All patients were treated with prednisone and six 
pulses of cyclophosphamide on induction therapy. Conventional maintenance 
therapy was administered in both groups.
RESULTS: Compared to progressors, the non-progressor group showed a lower 
chronicity index (p = 0.01) and fewer CD68-positive cells in the renal tubules 
(p = 0.01) and particularly in the renal interstitium (p = 0.0003). Baseline and 
final serum creatinine correlated positively with the chronicity index (r = 0.3, 
p = 0.01 and r = 0.3, p = 0.04, respectively), and final serum creatinine 
correlated positively with interstitial expression of CD68 (r = 0.4, 
p = 0.0006).
CONCLUSION: Renal expression of CD68 and the chronicity index are associated 
with progression to chronic kidney disease in patients with proliferative LN.

Expressed on the cell surface of most of NK cells and some T cells, CD161 has 
been shown to deliver inhibitory signal in human NK cells. To determine whether 
the CD161-expressing cell quantities and the cell surface expression levels of 
CD161 in NK and T cells were altered in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
patients, we analyzed the CD3, CD56 and CD161 expression patterns of peripheral 
blood lymphocytes by flow cytometric analysis to identify different NK and T 
cell subpopulations. The cell surface expression levels of CD161 were estimated 
by the mean florescence intensities (MFIs) of CD161. It was found that SLE 
patients had lower frequencies of CD161+CD56+CD3- and CD161+CD56+CD3+ cells 
among the lymphocyte population than normal controls, whereas the frequencies of 
CD161-CD56+CD3- and CD161+CD56-CD3+ cells were not statistically different 
between two groups. In addition, SLE patients also had decreased absolute counts 
of all CD161-expressing NK cells and T cells and had reduced frequencies of 
CD161+ cells in CD56+CD3-, CD56+CD3+ and CD56-CD3+ cell populations. Moreover, 
SLE patients had reduced MFIs of CD161 in CD161+CD56+CD3+ and CD161+CD56-CD3+, 
but not CD161+CD56+CD3-, cell populations. Our results indicated that 
CD161-expressing cell frequency and the CD161 expression levels were reduced in 
some NK and T cell subpopulations of SLE patients, suggesting possible important 
role of CD161 and CD161-expressing immune cells in the SLE pathogenesis.

The aim of the study was to describe biomarkers of lipid metabolism associated 
with increased cardiovascular risk and their correlation with disease variables 
and markers of inflammation in adolescent females with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). This cross-sectional controlled study evaluated 33 
adolescent females with juvenile SLE and 33 healthy controls. Anthropometric 
data, SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), medications, proteinuria, 
ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (us-CRP), lipid profile (total cholesterol, 
LDL-c, HDL-c and triglycerides), apolipoproteins A and B (Apo A-I and B), 
paraoxonase, and myeloperoxidase were evaluated. Median age of the patients and 
the median disease duration were 16.7 years and 54 months, respectively. SLEDAI 
scores above 4 were observed in 11 (33.3 %) patients. Moreover, 12 (36.4 %) 
patients were overweight, and 5 (15.2 %) had low height for age ratios. 
Dyslipidemia was observed in 13 (39.4 %) patients and in 7 (21.2 %) controls 
with a decrease in HDL-c concentrations in SLE patients even after adjustment 
for their nutritional status. In the group with SLE, us-CRP concentrations were 
inversely correlated with LDL-c/ApoB ratio (p = 0.031). After multivariate 
regression analysis, the SLE group showed lower concentration of Apo A-I and a 
decreased LDL-c/ApoB ratio. SLE adolescent females with low disease activity, 
with preserved kidney function and on low dose of corticosteroids, regardless of 
nutritional status and food intake, have proatherogenic lipid biomarkers, which 
may contribute to an increased atherosclerotic risk.

No Zinc Deficiency But a Putative Immunosuppressive Role for Labile Zn in 
Patients with Systemic Autoimmune Disease.

Australia - M503; 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley WA 6009,. Australia.

BACKGROUND: Zn (Zn) is an essential trace element with important roles in 
protein structure and function. Labile Zn is the fraction available for 
regulatory functions through it loose binding to albumin. As Zn deprivation 
reduces labile Zn levels and leads to an immune compromised state, we 
investigated labile Zn levels in the context of systemic autoimmune disease.
METHODS: Cross sectional case control study in patients with Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (SLE; n= 45), primary Sjögren's Syndrome (n= 53) and healthy 
controls (HC; n= 27). Serum labile Zn levels were measured by an in-house assay 
using the UV-excitable fluorophore zinquin ethyl ester. Associations between 
labile Zn levels and SLE manifestations were investigated by nonparametric 
methods.
RESULTS: None of the SLE or pSS patients was found to be Zn deficient. Labile Zn 
levels were significantly higher in SLE (31.7 mcg/dl) than in pSS patients (22.3 
mcg/dl) and HC (19.7 mcg/dl) (p<0.001). Labile Zn levels did not associate with 
demographics, disease activity scores, or inflammatory cytokine levels, but 
correlated inversely with lymphocyte counts (Rs -0.37, p<0.01), antidsDNA, 
anticardiolipin (Rs -0.29, p=0.01), anti-rib P antibody levels (Rs -0.24, 
p=0.02) and with circulating NK-cell numbers in SLE patients (Rs .27, p= 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of Zn deficiency in patients with pSS or SLE. 
Labile Zn levels are unexpectedly high in SLE patients, independent of cytokine 
levels and may play a role in immune modulation through increased NK numbers and 
autoantibody containment.

The regulation of the Treg/Th17 balance by mesenchymal stem cells in human 
systemic lupus erythematosus.

Wang D, Huang S, Yuan X, Liang J, Xu R, Yao G, Feng X, Sun L.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Umbilical cord (UC)-derived mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) have shown immunoregulation of various immune cells. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the mechanism of UC MSCs in the regulation of 
peripheral regulatory T cells (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells in patients 
with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: Thirty patients with active SLE, refractory to conventional therapies, 
were given UC MSCs infusions. The percentages of peripheral blood 
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD3+CD8-IL17A+ Th17 cells and the 
mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of Foxp3 and IL-17 were measured at 1 week, 
1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after MSCs transplantation (MSCT). 
Serum cytokines, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-17A were detected 
using ELISA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were collected and 
co-cultured with UC MSCs at ratios of 1:1, 10:1, and 50:1, respectively, for 72 
h to detect the proportions of Treg and Th17 cells and the MFIs of Foxp3 and 
IL-17 were determined by flow cytometry. The cytokines in the supernatant 
solution were detected using ELISA. Inhibitors targeting TGF-β, IL-6, 
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and prostaglandin E2 were added to the 
co-culture system, and the percentages of Treg and Th17 cells were observed.
RESULTS: The percentage of peripheral Treg and Foxp3 MFI increased 1 week, 1 
month, and 3 months after UC MSCs transplantation, while the Th17 proportion and 
MFI of IL-17 decreased 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the treatment, 
along with an increase in serum TGF-β at 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months and a 
decrease in serum TNF-α beginning at 1 week. There were no alterations in serums 
IL-6 and IL-17A before or after MSCT. In vitro studies showed that the UC MSCs 
dose-dependently up-regulated peripheral Treg proportion in SLE patients, which 
was not depended on cell-cell contact. However, the down-regulation of Th17 
cells was not dose-dependently and also not depended on cell-cell contact. 
Supernatant TGF-β and IL-6 levels significantly increased, TNF-α significantly 
decreased, but IL-17A had no change after the co-culture. The addition of 
anti-TGF-β antibody significantly abrogated the up-regulation of Treg, and the 
addition of PGE2 inhibitor significantly abrogated the down-regulation of Th17 
cells. Both anti-IL-6 antibody and IDO inhibitor had no effects on Treg and Th17 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: UC MSCs up-regulate Treg and down-regulate Th17 cells through the 
regulation of TGF-β and PGE2 in lupus patients.

Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) is a less severe variant of systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) that generally resolves within weeks or months after 
the withdrawal of the implicated drug. DILE is unusual during childhood, with 
the most frequent age of presentation being at 50-70 years of age. Among 
different drugs, most commonly procainamide and hydralazine have been implicated 
as a cause of DILE. However carbamazepine (CBZ) is considered a low-risk drug 
and very few cases have been reported in children. We describe the case of 
CBZ-induced SLE in a 9-year-old girl following 3 years of CBZ therapy. This case 
report shows that drug-induced SLE is an important side-effect to be considered, 
even after long-term treatment with CBZ, and also during childhood.

A hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the consistent production of 
various auto-antibodies by auto-reactive B cells. Interferon-α (IFN-α) signaling 
is highly activated in SLE B cells and plays a vital role in the antibody 
response by B cells. Previous studies have shown that CD180-negative B cells, 
which are dramatically increased in SLE patients, are responsible for the 
production of auto-antibodies. However, the association between CD180 and IFN-α 
signaling remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the effect of CD180 
on regulating the activation of IFN-α signaling in B cells. We found that the 
number of CD180-negative B cells was increased in MRL/Mp-Fas(lpr/lpr) 
lupus-prone mice compared with wild-type mice. Phenotypic analysis showed that 
CD180-negative B cells comprised CD138+ plasmablast/plasma cells and GL-7+ 
germinal center (GC) B cells. Notably, ligation of CD180 significantly inhibited 
the IFN-α-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 2 (STAT-2) and expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in a 
Lyn-PI3K-BTK-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, ligation of CD180 could also 
inhibit IFN-α-induced ISG expression in B cells in vivo. Furthermore, the 
Toll-like receptor 7 and Toll-like receptor 9 signaling pathways could 
significantly downregulate CD180 expression and modulate the inhibitory effect 
of CD180 signaling on the activation of IFN-α signaling. Collectively, our 
results highlight the close association between the increased proportion of 
CD180-negative B cells and the activation of IFN-α signaling in SLE. Our data 
provide molecular insight into the mechanism of IFN-α signaling activation in 
SLE B cells and a potential therapeutic approach for SLE treatment.

BACKGROUND: Treatment response in lupus nephritis (LN) is defined clinically, 
without consideration of renal histology. Few studies have systematically 
examined histologic responses to induction therapy. In LN patients who underwent 
protocol kidney biopsies after induction immunosuppression, we describe the 
renal histology of the second biopsy and correlate histologic activity and 
damage with short- and long-term kidney outcomes.
METHODS: Patients with suspected LN were biopsied for diagnosis (Biopsy 1), and 
those with proliferative LN were rebiopsied after induction (Biopsy 2). 
Histologic activity and damage at each biopsy were calculated as the National 
Institutes of Health activity and chronicity indices. Complete and partial renal 
responses after induction and after long-term follow-up were determined 
clinically.
RESULTS: One-third of patients who achieved a complete clinical response after 
induction had persistently high histologic activity, and 62% of patients who had 
complete histologic remission on rebiopsy were still clinically active. Chronic 
renal damage increased after induction even in complete clinical responders. 
Chronicity at Biopsy 2 associated with long-term kidney function and development 
of chronic kidney disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Early clinical and histologic outcomes are discordant in 
proliferative LN, and neither correlates with long-term renal outcome. The 
kidney accrues chronic damage rapidly and despite clinical response in LN. 
Preservation of kidney function may require therapeutic targeting of both 
chronic damage and inflammation during LN induction treatment.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of medical 
history and reproductive factors on the development of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) among Japanese females.
METHODS: One hundred and sixty female SLE patients and 660 female volunteers 
were studied in a case-control study. Unconditional logistic regression was used 
to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: The present study demonstrated that medical histories of operations 
without blood transfusion (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.10-2.44) and operations with 
blood transfusion (OR = 4.44, 95% CI = 1.93-10.23) increased the risk of SLE 
with adjustment for age, region, smoking and alcohol drinking. Among 91 SLE 
patients and 284 control subjects who had the experience of married life, 
nulliparity (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.05-5.17), increased the risk of SLE, while 
the risk decreased according to the number of children (one to two vs. none, 
OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.10-0.73; three or more vs. none, OR = 0.14, 95% 
CI = 0.04-0.51; P for trend < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Several factors are suggested to be associated with the development 
of SLE among Japanese females.

Although the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) worsen during 
pregnancy, few previous studies have reported lupus enteritis in pregnant women 
with SLE. A 29-year-old pregnant Japanese woman presented with acute abdomen. 
Six years before pain onset, she developed pure red cell aplasia and tested 
positive for anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) antibodies. Anti-DNA antibodies 
were detected two and a half years later. The patient remained asymptomatic 
until she developed acute abdomen. A mild increase in anti-DNA antibody levels 
and a mild decrease in complement levels were observed, and abdominal ultrasound 
and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of large-volume ascites and 
edematous thickening of the small intestinal wall. These findings established 
the diagnosis of lupus enteritis. Her condition improved after treatment with 
prednisolone 50 mg/day, and she delivered a female infant weighing approximately 
1810 g at 37 weeks of gestation. Our study suggests that lupus enteritis should 
be suspected in female patients with autoimmune disease who develop acute 
abdomen during pregnancy, and that magnetic resonance imaging is useful in its 
diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated differences in subcortical brain volumes of 
SLE patients with cognitive deficits (SLE-CD) and SLE patients with normal 
cognitive performance (SLE-CN), regardless of the presence of other 
neuropsychiatric symptoms.
METHOD: We studied 40 patients divided into two-matched groups (SLE-CD n = 20; 
SLE-CN n = 20), with age ranging from 21 to 63 years old (100 % female) and 
14.73 ± 10.18 years of diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging exams were 
performed on a 1.5 T scanner. A neuropsychological flexible battery was applied 
individually, including reasoning/problem-solving, praxis, episodic and working 
memory, processing speed, language/fluency, executive functions (inhibition and 
flexibility), and sustained attention. Z score ≤ - 2.0 in any dimension was 
considered as a cut-off for being considered to possess cognitive deficits. 
One-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to compare the brain 
structure volumes between groups. The analyses were controlled for the effects 
of lupus-related neuropsychiatric disorders.
RESULTS: SLE patients with cognitive deficits had significantly smaller volumes 
in the left hippocampus, amygdala, and the right hippocampus than SLE patients 
without cognitive deficits.
CONCLUSION: SLE patients with cognitive deficits appeared to have reduced 
temporal lobe structures when compared with SLE without cognitive deficits. 
These results corroborate a systems vulnerability model that investigated 
temporal lobe vulnerability during normal aging and in other neurological 
disorders.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Hakka populations.
METHODS: We studied the demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics in 
a cohort of 552 SLE patients diagnosed at the Rheumatology Department in MeiZhou 
People's Hospital from January 2008 to December 2012. There were 495 women and 
57 men (8.7 : 1) with a mean age of 35.3 years (range 12-78 years). The mean age 
at disease onset and the mean disease duration were 31.8 ± 14.4 years and 
3.3 ± 2.8 years, respectively.
RESULTS: The most common clinical manifestations were arthritis (61.6%), 
followed by malar rash (52.7%), photosensitivity (22.8%), mouth ulcers (17.0%) 
and discoid lupus (14.7%). The prevalence was 46.7% for nephritis (by biopsy), 
18.3% for pleuritis, 15.6% for pericarditis and 4.9% for neuropsychiatric 
manifestations. The most common hematological manifestations were anemia 
(63.8%), followed by leucopenia (29.0%) and thrombocytopenia (14.9%). 
Antinuclear antibodies were detected in 99.8% of patients, followed by 
anti-double-stranded DNA (81.3%), anti-SSA (Sjögren's syndrome antigen A)/Ro 
(58.7%), anti-ribonucleoprotein (36.8%), anti-Sm (35.7%), and anti-SSB/La 
(15.0%). Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM were detected in 18.3% 
and 14.1% of patients, respectively. Active disease and infections were the two 
major causes of death.
CONCLUSION: The clinical and immunological characteristics of the SLE patients 
in our study place our population in the middle of the spectrum between other 
Asian and Caucasian populations.

A 61-year-old woman was admitted for long-lasting fever and recurrent 
opportunistic infections during the treatment of SLE. She had been diagnosed as 
SLE and type-IV nephritis based on a renal biopsy and serological findings. A 
colonoscopy and liver biopsy revealed disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex 
infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection status was then examined 
and found to be positive. From the clinical course, the first symptoms were 
inferred to have been those of HIV infection.

We report on a 41-year-old woman with refractory systemic lupus erythematosus 
with massive pericarditis, macrophage activation syndrome, and 
glomerulonephritis despite high-dose glucocorticoids and tacrolimus. Tocilizumab 
dramatically improved pericarditis, and glomerulonephritis was controlled after 
adding cyclophosphamide. We had to halt tocilizumab and cyclophosphamide due to 
possible pneumocystis infection after five and three infusions of tocilizumab 
and intravenous cyclophosphamide, respectively. Nevertheless, no lupus flare had 
been observed on glucocorticoid monotherapy and enabled further rapid tapering 
prednisolone.

Herein we report a case of the simultaneous occurrence of angioimmunoblastic 
T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a 76-year-old 
woman. She presented with fever, night sweats, and general malaise. A laboratory 
examination revealed leukopenia, anemia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, 
hypocomplementemia, positive results for anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-double 
strand DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, and mild proteinuria. A computed tomography 
scan of the abdominal cavity showed multiple swollen intra-abdominal and 
intra-pelvic lymph nodes. A biopsy specimen obtained from the peri-iliac lymph 
node confirmed the diagnosis of AITL, while renal biopsy results were consistent 
with lupus nephritis, International Society of Nephrology and Renal Pathology 
Society class V. These results indicated that our patient developed SLE 
concomitantly with AITL. These findings will lead to further understanding of 
the pathogenic mechanism of SLE.

University, Zagazig, Egypt.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of perceived neighborhood characteristics, 
socioeconomic status (SES) and rural residency in influencing the health status 
outcome of Egyptian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: Eighty patients affected with SLE were consecutively included in this a 
single-center cross-sectional study from July, 2011 to July, 2013. Outcome 
measures included the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) score, the 
Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey physical functioning score 
and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D score of ≥ 19 points). 
Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Results from multivariate logistic regression analyses, a separate 
adjusted model of each perceived neighborhood characteristic, indicate 
associations of worse perceived social cohesion with higher SLAQ scores 
(P < 0.01) and associations of worse perceived neighborhood aesthetics and 
safety with lower SF-36 physical functioning scores after adjusting for 
covariates (P < 0.01). Regarding the association of socioeconomic status and 
rural residency with health status outcomes, the results found association of 
poor socioeconomic status with the three health status outcome measures and 
association between rural residency and depression symptoms. Individuals had 
increased odds of depressive symptoms if they perceived worse neighborhood 
social cohesion (odds ratio [OR]: 2.14; CI: 1.42-2.80), if they perceived worse 
neighborhood safety (OR: 1.64; CI: 1.02-2.40) and if they perceived worse 
neighborhood aesthetic characteristics (OR: 2.79; CI: 1.84-3.38).
CONCLUSIONS: Study findings indicate that poor socioeconomic status, rural 
residency and perceived neighborhood characteristics are associated with 
depression; worse perceived neighborhood aesthetics and safety are associated 
with lower SF-36 physical functioning, and worse neighborhood social cohesion is 
associated with higher disease activity among patients with SLE.

BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is an important 
negative regulator of T-cell response. It is a functional candidate gene 
connected with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We analyzed 
the role of -318C/T polymorphism in the promoter region of the CTLA-4 gene in 
Iranian patients suffering from SLE.
METHODS: A total of 180 SLE patients and 304 healthy ethnically matched controls 
were enrolled in the study. DNA was extracted from blood samples according to 
the standard procedure. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragments length 
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to analyze the genotype and allele frequencies 
of these polymorphisms.
RESULTS: The CC genotype was observed in 170 (94.5%) of the SLE patients, which 
was significantly different compared to the controls (251 [82.4%]; P = 0.0001, 
OR = 3.51 95%CI = 1.77-7.53). T allele was significantly more common in the 
controls (9.2%) compared to SLE patients 2.8% (P = 0.0001, OR = 0.26, 
95%CI = 0.13-0.53). There was no significant correlation between different 
genotypes and age, gender or family history of SLE in the studied population.
CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that -318C/T polymorphism of CTLA-4 gene might 
play a significant role in the development of SLE in the Iranian patients.
