Immune checkpoints are small molecules expressed by immune cells that play 
critical roles in maintaining immune homeostasis. Targeting the immune 
checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed 
death 1 (PD-1) with inhibitory antibodies has demonstrated effective and durable 
antitumor activity in subgroups of patients with cancer. The US Food and Drug 
Administration has approved several immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPis) for the 
treatment of a broad spectrum of malignancies. Endocrinopathies have emerged as 
one of the most common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of ICPi therapy. 
Hypophysitis, thyroid dysfunction, insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, and 
primary adrenal insufficiency have been reported as irAEs due to ICPi therapy. 
Hypophysitis is particularly associated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy, whereas 
thyroid dysfunction is particularly associated with anti-PD-1 therapy. Diabetes 
mellitus and primary adrenal insufficiency are rare endocrine toxicities 
associated with ICPi therapy but can be life-threatening if not promptly 
recognized and treated. Notably, combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy 
is associated with the highest incidence of ICPi-related endocrinopathies. The 
precise mechanisms underlying these endocrine irAEs remain to be elucidated. 
Most ICPi-related endocrinopathies occur within 12 weeks after the initiation of 
ICPi therapy, but several have been reported to develop several months to years 
after ICPi initiation. Some ICPi-related endocrinopathies may resolve 
spontaneously, but others, such as central adrenal insufficiency and primary 
hypothyroidism, appear to be persistent in most cases. The mainstay of 
management of ICPi-related endocrinopathies is hormone replacement and symptom 
control. Further studies are needed to determine (i) whether high-dose 
corticosteroids in the treatment of ICPi-related endocrinopathies preserves 
endocrine function (especially in hypophysitis), and (ii) whether the 
development of ICPi-related endocrinopathies correlates with tumor response to 
ICPi therapy.

Autoimmune Aspects of Kawasaki Disease.

Sakurai Y(1).

Author information:

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a vasculitis that is part of systemic vasculitis 
syndrome. It affects medium-sized vessels and is characterized by 
hypercytokinemia. Although the etiology of KD remains unidentified, 
epidemiological features point to the role of infection and genetic 
predisposition. Recent studies on KD revealed endothelial damage and resultant 
thrombin generation, as well as B-cell activation during the acute phase. 
Several antiendothelial cell autoantibodies (AECAs) have been identified in KD 
patients. Analysis of this phenomenon together with the recently developed 
concept of immunothrombosis reveals a potential pathogenic mechanism for KD. 
First, polyclonal antibodies generated against invading microorganisms would 
exhibit cross-reactivity toward endothelial cell components and become dominant 
during affinity maturation. Binding of AECAs to endothelial cells would cause 
endothelial activation or damage, with proinflammatory cytokine release, thus 
fostering a hypercoagulable state resulting from leukocyte activation by 
proinflammatory cytokines. This, in turn, would lead to coronary artery lesions. 
KD vasculitis might be initiated upon binding of AECAs to the vasa vasorum and 
progress to panvasculitis and a vulnerable vessel wall, resulting in an 
aneurysm. The aneurysm would cause flow recirculation and alteration of wall 
shear stress. Consequently, platelets activated by shear stress, along with 
ultralarge von Willebrand factor (VWF) released by endothelial cells, would 
cause platelet-driven arterial thrombosis. Autoimmunity-associated thrombosis 
initiated by binding of AECAs to endothelial cells might play a major role in 
the pathogenesis of certain subtypes of KD. The notion of KD consisting of 
subtypes, the major one of which is AECA-associated vasculitis, will help 
improve our understanding of KD and further promote early and accurate 
diagnosis, which remains challenging.

In the future artificial intelligence (AI) will have the potential to improve 
outcomes diabetes care. With the creation of new sensors for physiological 
monitoring sensors and the introduction of smart insulin pens, novel data 
relationships based on personal phenotypic and genotypic information will lead 
to selections of tailored, effective therapies that will transform health care. 
However, decision-making processes based exclusively on quantitative metrics 
that ignore qualitative factors could create a quantitative fallacy. Difficult 
to quantify inputs into AI-based therapeutic decision-making processes include 
empathy, compassion, experience, and unconscious bias. Failure to consider these 
"softer" variables could lead to important errors. In other words, that which is 
not quantified about human health and behavior is still part of the calculus for 
determining therapeutic interventions.

Myelin is a multilamellar cell membrane around axons and is essential for fast 
saltatory conduction and maintenance of axonal integrity and survival. 
Congenital and acquired abnormalities of myelin lead to neurological disorders 
involving degeneration and loss of axons and neurons, which are implicated in 
permanent neurological deficits and progressive neurological decline. As in 
other neurological disorders, neural degeneration and loss in myelin diseases 
are associated with multiple factors including aberrant inflammatory responses, 
oxidative stresses, and impaired axonal metabolism involving cationic 
sequestration and energy production. Metabolic regulation depends on 
mitochondrial function, and impaired mitochondrial dynamics cause degeneration 
and loss of axons and neurons. Future studies on the regulatory mechanisms of 
axonal and neuronal degeneration in myelin diseases, which include further 
development of animal models and better screening approaches for possible 
interventions, contribute to deeper understanding of axonal interactions with 
glia and myelin ensheathment and potentially lead to novel therapeutic 
strategies to protect the function and survival of axons and neurons in myelin 
diseases.

RATIONALE: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (eGPA) is a 
small-vessel vasculitis where 40% of patients present with serum antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). We examined the presence and clinical relevance 
of sputum ANCAs in the serum ANCA- patients with eGPA.
METHODS: ANCA was investigated in matched sputum and blood samples collected 
from 23 patients with eGPA (n = 10, serum ANCA+), 19 patients with eosinophilic 
asthma (prednisone dependent), and 13 healthy volunteers. IgG reactivity to 
common target antigens and cytokine profiles in sputum samples were examined. 
Pathogenicity of detected sputum ANCA was assessed using in vitro degranulation 
assays.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Most patients with eGPA (17 of 23, 74%) showed 
significantly increased sputum ANCAs compared with patients with eosinophilic 
asthma (P = 0.002) and healthy controls (P < 0.0001), irrespective of their 
serum ANCA status. In addition, 16 of 17 (94%) of sputum ANCA+ patients had 
clinical manifestations of severe asthma compared with 3 of 6 (50%) in the 
sputum ANCA- subset (P = 0.04). Microarray analysis of 123 common antigens 
failed to reveal a specific target for the ANCA IgG. However, immunoprecipitated 
immunoglobulins from ANCA+ sputum allowed extensive extracellular trap 
formations from both neutrophils and eosinophils in vitro, indicating 
pathogenicity of detected IgG autoantibodies. Cytokine analysis showed 
lung-localized increases in CXCL8 (neutrophil/eosinophil chemotaxis), CCL24 
(eosinophil recruitment), and CXCL12 (lymphocyte recruitment) in the sputa from 
ANCA+ patients (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel finding of ANCA reactivity in the sputa of 
patients with eGPA in whom disease severity is driven by respiratory 
complications. Investigating localized autoimmunity may lead to the discovery of 
novel pathomechanisms, therapeutic targets, and optimal biomarkers for 
diagnosing and managing eGPA.

BACKGROUND: Acute eosinophilic myocarditis (EM) is a rare form of heart failure 
that is characterized by myocardial eosinophilic infiltration usually in 
association with peripheral eosinophilia. The underlying cause is variable and 
can include allergic reactions, parasitic infection, idiopathic 
hypereosinophilic syndrome, malignancy, Loeffler's syndrome, Churg-Strauss 
syndrome (CSS), early giant cell myocarditis and malignancy. The course is 
potentially fatal, and early diagnosis and treatment with steroids is essential.
CONCLUSION: Here, we present an illustrative case of eosinophilic myocarditis 
secondary to CSS followed by a brief review of epidemiology, pathogenesis, 
diagnosis and treatment of both disease entities.

BACKGROUND: Amyloidosis is a life-threatening complication of Rheumatoid 
Arthritis (RA) that should be detected as early as possible to avoid its 
morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To detect subclinical amyloidosis in RA patients without proteinuria 
and a disease duration more than 5 years.
PATIENTS: Eighty-six RA patients seen between October 2013 and August 2014 were 
recruited for the study. Those with 5 years disease duration were included in 
the study but those who had proteinuria, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, disease 
onset before the age of 16 years or improper specimens, were excluded, leaving 
30 eligible patients (23 women, 7 men). The clinical, laboratory and imaging 
results and treatments were maintained for each patient. Abdominal Fat 
Aspiration Biopsy (AFAB) was performed on all 30 patients. Amyloid deposits were 
spotted by polarised light microscopy following Congo red staining. Informed 
consent was acquired from all patients. Clinical disease activity was scored 
according to DAS. ELISA measured serum amyloid A protein (SAA), CRP and RF.
RESULTS: AFAB stained positive for amyloid in 4 (13.3%) patients out of 30. The 
amyloid deposits were (1+) in 1 patient and (2+) in 3 patients. Longer RA 
duration correlated positively with amyloidosis (12.50 years versus 6.15years) 
(P < 0.001). Extra-articular manifestations were present in 50% of the amyloid 
patients and in 15.3% of the non-amyloid patients. This difference was 
significant (P < 0.01). DAS 28 score was higher in amyloid patients (P < 0.001). 
No difference was found between amyloid and non-amyloid patients regarding age, 
sex or deformities. SAA was significantly higher in amyloid patients (P < 
0.001). However, haemoglobin levels were found to be significantly lower in 
amyloid patients (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of subclinical amyloidosis by AFAB was found to be 
(13.3%). The use of AFAB should be encouraged, particularly in patients with 
longer disease duration and low haemoglobin level to confirm early detection of 
subclinical amyloidosis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system autoimmune disease 
characterized by demyelination. Autoreactive T cells mainly interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ) producing T helper cells (Th1) have an important role in MS 
pathogenesis. Silymarin is a unique blend produced from milk thistle (Silybum 
marianum) plant which its imunomodulatory role has been indicated in studies. In 
the present study, the effects of silymarin on isolated Th1 cells were 
investigated in newly diagnosed MS patients and those who received betaferon. 
PBMCs were separated from newly diagnosed and IFN-β-treated MS patients. The Th1 
cell isolation from PBMCs was performed using a human Th1 cell isolation kit. 
Th1 cells were cultured in the presence of silymarin (50, 100, and 150 μM for 
48, 72, and 120 h). Th1 cell proliferation and CD69 expression were assessed by 
flow cytometry. Also, IFN-γ production and T-bet gene expression were measured 
by ELISA and real-time PCR respectively. In vitro cultured Th1 cells showed that 
silymarin suppresses Th1 cell proliferation dose and time dependently in newly 
diagnosed and IFN-β-treated MS patients in comparison to DMSO control. Also, 
CD69 expression as an early activation marker was changed after Th1 cell 
treatment with different doses of silymarin at different times. T-bet gene 
expression was significantly decreased in Th1 cells isolated from newly 
diagnosed and IFN-β-treated RRMS patients after treatment with silymarin 
compared to DMSO control. Additionally, IFN-γ production by Th1 cells was 
decreased after treatment silymarin in newly diagnosed patients; however, in 
IFN-β treated after 48-h treatment with silymarin, IFN-γ concentration was 
decreased at concentrations of 100 and 150 μM, and after 120 h, a significant 
increase was observed in the IFN-γ level at a concentration of 100 μM in 
comparison with DMSO. Our findings here clearly show that silymarin is an 
effective regulator for Th1 response in vitro condition. It not only suppresses 
Th1 proliferating activity but also inhibits T-bet gene expression and IFN-γ 
production by these cells.

In rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, cardiovascular disease 
is frequently one of the leading causes of mortality or morbidity. Studies have 
shown that acute systemic inflammation and chronic systemic vasculitis are 
associated with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic plaque formation, 
subsequently leading to cardiovascular disease. This meta-analysis aimed to 
explore the association of subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness in 
primary Sjogren's syndrome. A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and Embase 
databases was performed from date of inception through August 2017. The 
inclusion criterion was observational studies evaluating the association between 
primary Sjogren's syndrome, subclinical atherosclerosis, and arterial stiffness 
by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV) and intima-media thickness (IMT). 
Definitions of PSS and methods to assess PWV and IMT were recorded for each 
study. Different locations of IMT were evaluated including common carotid, 
internal carotid, and femoral arteries. The pooled mean difference (MD) of PWV 
and IMT and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect 
meta-analysis. The between-study heterogeneity of effect size was quantified 
using the Q statistic and I2. Data were extracted from eight observational 
studies involving 767 subjects. Pooled result demonstrated a significant 
increase in PWV in patients who have PSS compared with controls (MD = 1.30 m/s; 
95% CI 0.48-2.12; p value = 0.002; I2 = 85%). Patients with PSS also have higher 
IMT (MD = 0.08 mm; 95% CI 0.04-0.11; p value < 0.01; I2 = 72%). Our study 
suggests that PSS is associated with arterial stiffness and subclinical 
atherosclerosis. Further studies need to be conducted to find the correlation of 
subclinical atherosclerosis in PSS with the cardiovascular event, the 
pathophysiological changes of arterial stiffness in PSS, and the benefit of 
statins, because controlling cardiovascular risk factors or disease activity 
could potentially help avoid progression of atherosclerosis to overt 
cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and autoimmune disease of the 
central nervous system (CNS), mainly characterized by inflammatory 
demyelination, which manifests as relapses and diffuse damage and brain volume 
loss, both accounting for neurodegeneration, and therefore, physical disability. 
MS typically affects young adults and is commonly diagnosed in the early years 
by acute relapses, which then followed through partial or complete remission 
period. The clinical course of MS is characterized as four major 
classifications, including relapsing-remitting (RRMS), primary progressive 
(PPMS), progressive relapsing (PRMS), and secondary progressive (SPMS).
PURPOSE: This review provides comprehensive overview of the current treatments 
and future innovative approaches in the treatment of MS.
RESULTS: Currently, there is no definite cure for MS. The treatment of MS has 
mainly been based on the prescription of immunosuppressive and immune-modulating 
agents. However, a number of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) have been 
designed that reduce the attack rate and delay progression and mainly target 
inflammation settings in these patients. Although remarkable advancements have 
occurred in the therapy of MS, the rate of progressive disability and early 
mortality is still worrisome. Recently, a monoclonal antibody (ocrelizumab) was 
demonstrated to be beneficial in a clinical trial of primary progressive MS. 
Furthermore, novel treatment strategies concentrating on the remyelination or 
neuroprotection are under evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of prosperous experiences in MS therapy, the future 
research, hopefully, will bring substantial improvements in the understanding 
and approaches of MS therapy.

'It's an important part, but I am not quite sure that it is working': educators' 
perspectives on the implementation of goal-setting within the 'DAFNE' diabetes 
structured education programme.

AIM: To explore educators' perspectives on the implementation of goal-setting 
and action-planning strategies within a structured diabetes self-management 
education programme.
METHODS: Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with diabetes 
self-management education providers delivering the 'Dose Adjustment for Normal 
Eating' (DAFNE) programme to people with Type 1 diabetes throughout Ireland. A 
pre-designed topic guide, focused on exploring educators' experiences of 
delivery and application and views on usefulness of goal-setting strategies, was 
used in all interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed 
using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Five main themes were identified: 'people need a plan', discussing 
perspectives on goal-setting's value; 'the power of the group', highlighting the 
impact a group format has on goal-setting practices; 'diversity and 
individuality', discussing differences in DAFNE participants' and educators' 
engagement with goal-setting; 'goal-setting's fit', exploring perspectives on 
how well goal-setting fits within diabetes self-management education and 
follow-up care; and 'feelings of inadequate psychological knowledge', addressing 
challenges experienced in the delivery of goal-setting components.
CONCLUSION: While educators saw benefits in the implementation of goal-setting 
and planning strategies within diabetes self-management education, concerns 
about how well goal-setting currently fits within diabetes self-management 
education and follow-up care were evident. Additionally, many educators 
experienced the delivery of goal-setting and action-planning strategies as 
challenging and would value additional training opportunities.

Timings for HbA(1c) testing in people with diabetes are associated with 
incentive payments: an analysis of UK primary care data.

Oxford, UK.

AIMS: Guidelines recommend testing HbA1c every 3-6 months in people with 
diabetes. In the United Kingdom (UK), primary care clinics are financially 
incentivized to monitor HbA1c at least annually and report proportions of 
patients meeting targets on 31 March. We explored the hypothesis that this 
reporting deadline may be associated with over-frequent or delayed HbA1c 
testing.
METHODS: This analysis used HbA1c results from 100 000 people with diabetes 
during 2005-2014 in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink UK primary care 
database. Logistic regression was used to explore whether the four months prior 
to the deadline for quality reporting (December to March) or individual's 
previous HbA1c were aligned with retesting HbA1c within 60 days or > 1 year from 
the previous test, and identify other factors associated with the timing of 
HbA1c testing.
RESULTS: Retesting HbA1c within 60 days or > 1 year was more common in December 
to March compared with other months of the year (odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence 
interval 1.04-1.08 for retesting within 60 days). Those with higher HbA1c were 
more likely to have a repeat test within 60 days and less likely to have a 
repeat test > 1 year from the previous test.
CONCLUSIONS: We have found that retesting HbA1c within 60 days and > 1 year from 
the previous test was more common in December to March compared with the other 
months of the year. This work suggests that both practice-centred administrative 
factors and patient-centred considerations may be influencing diabetes care in 
the UK.

Neuropsychiatric manifestations in lupus (NPSLE) affect ∼20-40% of patients. In 
the central nervous system, lipocalin-2 (LCN2) can promote injury through 
mechanisms directly linked to NPSLE, including brain barrier disruption, 
neurotoxicity, and glial activation. Since LCN2 is elevated in lupus and has 
been implicated in neuroinflammation, we investigated whether LCN2 is required 
for the pathogenesis of NPSLE. Here, we investigated the effects of LCN2 
deficiency on the development of neurobehavioral deficits in the B6.Sle1.Sle3 
(Sle1,3) mouse lupus model. Sle1,3 mice exhibited depression-like behavior and 
impaired spatial and recognition memory, and these deficits were attenuated in 
Sle1,3-LCN2KO mice. Whole-brain flow cytometry showed a significant increase in 
brain infiltrating leukocytes in Sle1,3 mice that was not reduced by LCN2 
deficiency. RNA sequencing on sorted microglia revealed that several genes 
differentially expressed between B6 and Sle1,3 mice were regulated by LCN2, and 
that these genes are key mediators of the neuroinflammatory cascade. 
Importantly, LCN2 is upregulated in the cerebrospinal fluid of NPSLE patients 
across 2 different ethnicities. Our findings establish the Sle1,3 strain as an 
NPSLE model, demonstrate that LCN2 is a major regulator of the detrimental 
neuroimmune response in NPSLE, and identify CSF LCN2 as a novel biomarker for 
NPSLE.

PURPOSE: To assess quality of life (QoL) and cognitive function among Graves' 
disease (GD) patients with different thyroid status, with and without 
ophthalmopathy.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional clinic-based study involving 154 patients 
with GD (81.27% were female, mean age 45.6 ± SD 11.2 years) and 54 (35.06%) had 
ophthalmopathy. Data were collected after an informed consent from all patients 
was obtained. All patients completed the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and 
Mini-Mental State Examination. Patients with ophthalmopathy also completed the 
Graves' Orbitopathy Quality of Life Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Patients with hyperthyroidism presented a greater impairment in QoL 
when compared to euthyroidism group. A lower score in physical role functioning 
was found in both subgroups with active disease (hyperthyroidism and 
euthyroidism using thionamides). A lower score was also seen in visual function, 
only in patients with hyperthyroidism, without difference in appearance. No 
difference was found in cognition between patients. Younger ages at diagnosis, 
male sex, euthyroidism and absence of ophthalmopathy were factors associated 
with better QoL, as well as a shorter disease duration was associated with 
better recall, attention and calculation.
CONCLUSIONS: An impairment in QoL among patients with active GD was evidenced, 
even in those receiving thionamides and in euthyroidism. Ophthalmopathy was a 
factor associated with a poor QoL and no clear evidence of cognitive impairment 
was demonstrated.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on impairing 
women's sexuality regarding motivation, activity, and satisfaction, and to 
assess the correlation of disease-related physical impairment within sexual 
functioning.
METHODS: An anonymous survey among women with RA and healthy controls (HC) using 
standardized questionnaires, predominantly the Changes in Sexual Functioning 
Questionnaire-short form (CSFQ-14). In addition, disease activity, depression, 
and disability were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were 319 questionnaires distributed to patients and 306 to HC. Of 
these, 235 patient questionnaires (73.7%) and 180 HC questionnaires (58.8%) were 
returned, of which 203 and 169 were completed, respectively. Of the patients 
with RA, 47.8% had a total CSFQ-14 score of ≤ 41, indicating female sexual 
dysfunction (FSD), as compared to 14.2% of HC (p < 0.0001). The median CSFQ-14 
score was lower in patients with RA [42 points, interquartile range (IQR) 36-48] 
than in HC (49 points, IQR 44-54; p < 0.0001), resulting in an OR of 5.53 (95% 
CI 3.19-9.57; p < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounders, given a higher mean 
age of patients (55.2 ± 11.3 yrs) than HC (47.4 ± 11.8 yrs; p < 0.0001), the OR 
for FSD in patients with RA was still 3.04 (95% CI 1.61-5.75; p = 0.001). 
Neither the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index nor the Clinical 
Disease Activity Index was associated with FSD after adjustment.
CONCLUSION: FSD apparently is highly prevalent in female patients with RA, 
affects all subdomains of sexual function, and is most likely underestimated in 
daily clinical practice. Of note, FSD could not be linked to disability or RA 
disease activity.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia associated to insulin or other 
glucose-lowering agents is one of the most common causes of visits to the 
emergency department for adverse drug reactions. The study objective was to 
analyze the characteristics of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who attend a 
tertiary hospital emergency department for a hypoglycemic event.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 3-year retrospective analysis was conducted of patients 
with DM who attended the emergency department of Hospital Universitari de 
Bellvitge for a hypoglycemic event. An analysis was made of epidemiological and 
diabetes-related characteristics, prevalence of chronic diabetic complications 
and other comorbidities, the glucose-lowering treatment and the result of the 
hypoglycemic episode.
RESULTS: Of the 149 hypoglycemic events analyzed, 81.9% occurred in patients 
with type 2 DM. Mean age of patients with type 2 DM was 75.4 years. DM duration 
was longer than 10 years in 69.4% of patients. The prevalence rates of chronic 
kidney disease and cognitive decline were 38.5% and 19.7% respectively in 
patients with type 2 DM. Insulin with or without other concomitant 
glucose-lowering agents was associated to 78.7% of episodes in type 2 DM 
patients. The remaining 21.3% were associated to oral hypoglycemic agents, 
mainly glibenclamide. After the event, 13.4% of patients required hospital 
admission, and in 36.8% of these hypoglycemia was associated to use of 
glibenclamide.
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of hypoglycemic events occurred in elderly patients with 
type 2 DM, with a high prevalence of associated comorbidities and treated with 
insulin and sulfonylureas, particularly glibenclamide.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fampridine leads to significant improvements in walking 
in many people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, a relevant proportion of 
PwMS does not respond to fampridine and predictors of initial drug 
responsiveness are unknown.
METHODS: Drug response to prolonged-release (PR)-fampridine was assessed in 55 
PwMS using the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 6-min walk test (6MWT) and 12-item 
multiple sclerosis walking scale as outcome parameters. Patients were treated 
with PR-fampridine and placebo for 6 weeks each in a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial with crossover design (NCT01576354). Possible 
predictors of drug responsiveness were investigated by multiple correlation 
analysis and binary logistic regression models. An additional longitudinal 
analysis followed the drug responses of 32 patients treated with PR-fampridine 
over 3 years to identify potential predictors of long-term drug responsiveness.
RESULTS: Severity of walking disability was positively correlated with enhanced 
responses to PR-fampridine. The strongest single predictor of drug 
responsiveness was poor 6MWT performance at baseline, which was positively 
correlated with enhanced drug response in the 6MWT (R = -0.541; P < 0.001). A 
multivariable logistic regression model including 6MWT and T25FW baseline 
performances predicted PR-fampridine responder status with an accuracy of 85.5% 
(specificity, 90.0%; sensitivity, 73.3%), with a threshold of 211 m in the 6MWT 
best separating responders from non-responders. Enhanced drug responsiveness 
after 3 years correlated with decline in walking endurance during this period 
(R = -0.634; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Initial walking impairment is a good predictor of therapeutic 
responsiveness to PR-fampridine. Valid predictors of patients' responsiveness to 
PR-fampridine are essential for patient stratification and optimization of 
multiple slcerosis treatment.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with 
disturbances in muscle and bone metabolism.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether endocrine regulators 
of myogenesis and bone metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 
remission differed from unaffected healthy controls. An additional point was 
whether these were associated with patients' health-related functioning or 
particular bodily functions of the International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability and Health (ICF).
METHODS: Bone turnover and the markers for muscle, i.e. myostatin (MSTN), 
follistatin (FSTN), growth differentiation factor (GDF-15) and for bone, i.e. 
sclerostin (SOST), dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), periostin (PSTN) metabolism were 
determined in 24 female RA patients and matched healthy controls. The chair 
rising test (CRT), timed up and go test (TUG), 6 min walking test, maximum hand 
grip and back extensor strength tests were used to assess patients' 
health-related functions. Additionally, bone mineral density of the lumbar spine 
and the hip region was measured.
RESULTS: For the bone turnover markers no differences were observed between 
patients and controls. In contrast, the markers MSTN and Dkk1 were significantly 
lower and FSTN and PSTN significantly higher in patients than controls. Patients 
performed worse in the CRT and TUG. Some correlations reflected associations 
between these endocrine factors and physical function.
CONCLUSION: Anti-inflammatory therapy may be responsible for the positive effect 
on endocrine factors influencing myogenesis. Elevation of PSTN probably reflects 
the increased risk of fragility fractures in RA patients.

Sjögren syndrome (SS) is a systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease 
characterized by systemic disorders of the exocrine glands, predominantly the 
salivary and lacrimal glands. Here, we report a 4-year-old boy who presented 
with the repetition of generalized tonic-clonic seizures for 1-2 min. Initially, 
he was diagnosed with idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis and was treated with 
steroids. He was eventually diagnosed with SS based on the examination results, 
such as inflammatory cell infiltration into the minor salivary glands and 
positive serum anti-SSA/Ro antibody. Although central nervous system 
complications are rare in pediatric SS, this condition should be considered in 
the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with idiopathic autoimmune 
encephalitis of unknown cause. Furthermore, SS can occur in relatively young 
children and can present without imaging abnormalities.

DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic modification with a prominent role in 
determining mammalian cell development, lineage identity, and transcriptional 
regulation. Primarily linked to gene silencing, novel technologies have expanded 
the ability to measure DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale and uncover 
context-dependent regulatory roles. The immune system is a prototypic model for 
studying how DNA methylation patterning modulates cell type- and 
stimulus-specific transcriptional programs. Preservation of host defense and 
organ homeostasis depends on fine-tuned epigenetic mechanisms controlling 
myeloid and lymphoid cell differentiation and function, which shape innate and 
adaptive immune responses. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to human 
immune system pathology as seen in blood malignancies, infections, and 
autoimmune diseases. Identification of distinct epigenotypes linked to 
pathogenesis carries the potential to validate therapeutic targets in disease 
prevention and management.

BACKGROUND: Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease with pemphigus 
vulgaris (PV) and foliaceus (PF) as the two major histological subtypes. 
Associations with HLA molecules have been suggested, but specific HLA risk 
variants as well as non-HLA risk variants remain to be discovered.
METHODS: We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study in the Chinese 
Han population through a genome-wide discovery analysis and follow-up validation 
analysis in a total number of 210 PV, 159 PF and 2493 healthy controls. HLA 
imputation as well as high coverage next generation sequencing based HLA 
genotyping was employed to investigate the association of classical HLA alleles 
and amino acid change.
RESULTS: We have discovered independent novel associations with PF at rs2178077 
on 12q24.33, located next to RAN (PPF = 1.57 × 10-9 ) and rs3888722 within the 
MHC region (P = 6.73 × 10-9 ). For the HLA variants, we confirmed independent 
genome-wide level risk associations in HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1, with DQB1*05:03 to 
be the strongest association with PV (P = 8.59 × 10-68 , OR = 31.16) and PF (P = 
4.84 × 10-17 , OR = 5.64). In addition, DRB1*14 was demonstrated to be a second 
independent variants (P = 4.2 × 10-63 , OR = 35.47) for PV, while DRB1*04:06 was 
demonstrated to be the second independent signal (P = 7.44 × 10-13 , OR = 5.58) 
for PF.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of 
pemphigus susceptibility and may offer opportunities for risk prediction and 
preventive treatment for pemphigus, in particular for PV.

OBJECTIVES: A cohort of routine care RA patients in sustained remission had 
biological DMARD (bDMARDs) tapered according to a treatment guideline. We 
studied: the proportion of patients whose bDMARD could be successfully tapered 
or discontinued; unwanted consequences of tapering/discontinuation; and 
potential baseline predictors of successful tapering and discontinuation.
METHODS: One-hundred-and-forty-three patients (91% receiving TNF inhibitor and 
9% a non-TNF inhibitor) with sustained disease activity score (DAS28-CRP)⩽2.6 
and no radiographic progression the previous year were included. bDMARD was 
reduced to two-thirds of standard dose at baseline, half after 16 weeks, and 
discontinued after 32 weeks. Patients who flared (defined as either DAS28-CRP ⩾ 
2.6 and ΔDAS28-CRP ⩾ 1.2 from baseline, or erosive progression on X-ray and/or 
MRI) stopped tapering and were escalated to the previous dose level.
RESULTS: One-hundred-and-forty-one patients completed 2-year follow-up. At 2 
years, 87 patients (62%) had successfully tapered bDMARDs, with 26 (18%) 
receiving two-thirds of standard dose, 39 (28%) half dose and 22 (16%) having 
discontinued; and 54 patients (38%) were receiving full dose. ΔDAS28-CRP0-2yrs 
was 0.1((-0.2)-0.4) (median (interquartile range)) and mean 
ΔTotal-Sharp-Score0-2yrs was 0.01(1.15)(mean(s.d.)). Radiographic progression 
was observed in nine patients (7%). Successful tapering was independently 
predicted by: ⩽1 previous bDMARD, male gender, low baseline MRI combined 
inflammation score or combined damage score. Negative IgM-RF predicted 
successful discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: By implementing a clinical guideline, 62% of RA patients in 
sustained remission in routine care were successfully tapered, including 16% 
successfully discontinued at 2 years. Radiographic progression was rare. Maximum 
one bDMARDs, male gender, and low baseline MRI combined inflammation and 
combined damage scores were independent predictors for successful tapering.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data describing autoimmune skin diseases in 
sub-Saharan Africa and in HIV positive cohorts. We describe the incidence of 
autoimmune skin diseases in public dermatology clinics in Botswana.
METHODS: New patient records from public dermatology clinics were reviewed 
retrospectively for the period of September 2008 to December 2015. New diagnoses 
of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with 
cutaneous involvement, dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, lichen sclerosus, 
bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus vulgaris, and pemphigus 
vegetans were identified. Demographic data were recorded, and incidence was 
determined.
RESULTS: A total of 262 patients were diagnosed with autoimmune skin disease (4% 
of all new patients) with an incidence rate of 28.8 (per 1,000,000). Cutaneous 
lupus was the most common diagnosis with discoid lupus occurring most frequently 
(12.6). The incidence of systemic sclerosis (2.2), morphea (1.6), lichen 
sclerosus (1.5), SLE with cutaneous involvement (1.3) and dermatomyositis (1.2) 
was relatively lower. Bullous pemphigoid was the most common bullous disease 
(3.8). Pemphigus foliaceus (0.9), pemphigus vulgaris (0.6), and pemphigus 
vegetans (0.2) were observed at a lower rate. At least 19.8% of these patients 
were also HIV positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of autoimmune skin diseases in Botswana is lower 
compared to other published studies in other geographic areas, which may be 
reflective of a younger population, barriers to access, genetic differences, and 
a lack of comparative studies in sub-Saharan Africa. The hygiene hypothesis and 
helminth infections may also contribute to these differences. Further studies 
are needed to understand these disorders in this region.

The aims of this research were to evaluate and compare the effect in a matched 
sample of patients with type II and type I diabetes scores using a specific 
quality-of-life (QoL) tool related to overall and foot health (Foot Health 
Status Questionnaire [FHSQ]). A sample of 62 patients with an age median of 
59.00 ± 19.00 y were divided into type I (n = 31) and type II (n = 31) diabetes 
groups. Socio-demographics data include: (1) age, (2) gender, (3) body mass 
index, (4) professional activity, (5) study level, and (6) civil status. The 
FHSQ was used to evaluate foot (pain, function, footwear, and general health 
section I domains) and overall (general health, social capacity, physical 
activity, and vigour section II domains) health related to QoL. Differences 
between groups were assessed by means of a t test or Mann-Whitney U test for 
independent samples. There were no statistically significant differences (P > 
0.05) for any socio-demographic data. Regarding the FHSQ section II of the 
specific foot health-related QoL, the only statistically significant differences 
(P = 0.042) were observed for the general foot health showing a QoL impairment 
(lower median ± interquartile range) in patients diagnosed with type II diabetes 
(60.00 ± 60.00 points) compared with patients who suffered from type I diabetes 
(25.00 ± 72.50 points). The other domains did not show any statistically 
significant differences (P > 0.05). Patients with type II diabetes present a 
negative impact on the specific foot health-related QoL compared with patients 
who suffered from type I diabetes.

AIM: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major adverse events of concern associated 
with the use of biologics for managing autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic 
diseases (AIRDs). The study presents the data on incidence of TB in relation to 
biologic used, screening test and TB prophylaxis in a real-world setting.
METHODS: The cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study was conducted 
across 12 centres in Karnataka, India. The study included patients receiving 
biologics therapy for AIRDs, established based on the respective diagnostic 
criteria. The development of TB after receiving biologic therapy and other 
clinical variables and the predictability of the test performed for latent TB 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-five AIRDs patients with an average age of 41 
years were initiated on biologic therapy. Twenty-one patients were latent TB 
positive and were given antitubercular prophylaxis, prior to biologics 
treatment. During follow-up, seven patients belonging to the negative test group 
(n = 174) developed TB. The negative predictive values noted for Mantoux test (n 
= 120) and quantiFERON TB gold test (n = 178) were 96.52% and 96.25%, 
respectively. Patients on anti-tumor necrosis factor were more likely to develop 
TB. Presence of comorbidities and steroid use increased the likelihood of 
developing TB by 1.5 and 4.6 times, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Close monitoring of patients receiving biologics is essential for 
early identification of adverse events, especially in test negative patients. 
Prophylaxis can effectively reduce the risk of developing TB in patients 
positive for screening.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory disease closely linked with 
atherosclerosis. Recommended cardiovascular disease (CVD) integral evaluation 
includes screening for asymptomatic atherosclerosis plaques with carotid 
ultrasound (US). The aim of this study is to evaluate the carotid US 
characteristics, including carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and carotid 
plaque (CP), and compare RA-patients and controls in a Mexican-mestizo 
population.
METHOD: Prospective cross-sectional, observational study comparing RA-patients 
and matched controls without RA. Medical history and physical exam was performed 
in all subjects by a rheumatologist and two clinical blinded radiologists did 
the carotid US. Increased cIMT was defined as ≥0.9 mm. CP was defined as a focal 
narrowing ≥0.5 mm of the surrounding lumen or a cIMT ≥1.2 mm. Multivariable 
analysis was done comparing RA-patients and control subjects characteristics 
with carotid US.
RESULT: In the final analysis 209 patients were included, 103 patients with RA 
and 106 controls. Bilateral CP was found more than twice in RA than controls 
(15.5% vs 6.6%). Unilateral CP was more common in either side evaluated, being 
heterogeneous plaques the most common in RA-patients. The prevalence of 
increased cIMT was found higher in RA-patients either in both sides (right 37.9% 
vs 15.1%, P = 0.00; left 43.7% vs 19.8%, P = 0.00) were statistically 
significant.
CONCLUSION: It was confirmed that RA-patients have greater subclinical 
atherosclerosis represented in the carotid US measuring cIMT and CP as 
surrogates. RA-patients with subclinical atherosclerotic disease have more 
heterogeneous plaques characteristics.

AIM: This study aimed to determine the influence of methotrexate (MTX) on 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 529 consecutive patients with RA 
receiving oral MTX in our department between April 1 and September 30, 2017. GI 
symptoms were evaluated by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS); a 
score of ≥2 was considered "symptomatic." Prevalence of GI symptoms was compared 
between patients receiving ≤8 mg/wk (low-dose) vs >8 mg/wk (high-dose) of MTX.
RESULTS: Of our study population, 313 (59%) received low-dose MTX at a median 
(interquartile range) dose of 6 (6-8) mg/wk, whereas 216 (41%) received 
high-dose MTX at a median dose of 12 (10-12) mg/wk. Relative to the low-dose MTX 
group, the high-dose MTX group exhibited a higher prevalence of reflux (32% vs 
24%, P = 0.043) and abdominal pain (28% vs 18%, P = 0.007). There was no 
significant group-dependent difference in the prevalence of indigestion, 
diarrhea or constipation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed 
that high-dose MTX (>8 mg/wk) was independently associated with reflux (odds 
ratio [OR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.43) and abdominal pain 
(OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.04-2.43), and that the ORs for reflux and abdominal pain 
among those receiving high-dose MTX (>8 mg/wk) were similar to those using 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
CONCLUSION: High-dose MTX is independently associated with the prevalence of 
upper GI symptoms in Japanese patients with RA.

AIM: To investigate whether remission can be sustained for rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) patients after tapering abatacept (ABT).
METHOD: All patients were naïve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (bDMARDs) and in low or moderate Disease Activity Score of 28 joints with 
C-reactive protein (DAS)28-CRP). ABT was administrated intravenously (IV) or 
subcutaneously (SC) for 36 weeks to patients with RA, who had not previously 
received bDMARDs. As the ABT tapering protocol, ABT was administrated SC at 
125 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks in patients with remission. RA disease 
activity was assessed by DAS28-CRP and ultrasonography. Remission was assessed 
by defining it as DAS28-CRP <2.3.
RESULTS: Of the 51 patients, 84.3% were women (mean age 68.7 ± 10.2 years, mean 
disease duration 7.7 ± 10.2 years). Twenty-nine patients achieved remission and 
a power Doppler (PD) score ≤1 at each joint at 36 weeks, followed by tapering 
ABT. Of these patients, 25 sustained DAS28-CRP remission, and DAS28-CRP was not 
significantly elevated (1.62 ± 0.41 to 1.69 ± 0.49) at 48 weeks, but the total 
PD score was significantly elevated (1.52 ± 1.21 to 2.59 ± 2.81 P = 0.049). 
Longer disease duration, higher DAS28-CRP at 24 weeks, and higher total PD score 
at 24 weeks were predictors of an elevated total PD score after tapering ABT 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ABT tapering is a promising short-term 
strategy to sustain remission in patients with RA, and ultrasonography is a 
useful tool for monitoring disease activity after tapering ABT.

We discuss recent and prospective research in small and large vessel vasculitis. 
Large cohorts of Takayasu arteritis (TA) have been recently published from 
across the world, clarifying our understanding of this uncommon disease. Novel 
open-ended approaches like large-scale genotyping, proteomics and metabolomics 
have helped gain novel insights into TA, giant cell arteritis (GCA) and 
anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). Recent 
advances in the imaging of TA and GCA offer promise for earlier diagnosis and 
better monitoring of response to therapy. Although two randomized controlled 
trials of abatacept and tocilizumab failed to meet their primary end-points, 
successful large-scale studies of abatacept and tocilizumab in GCA hold promise 
for better disease control. While cyclophosphamide has revolutionized the 
management of AAV, increasing use of rituximab as an alternative induction 
regimen, as well as use of novel approaches involving reduced or no 
corticosteroid use for AAV and alternative agents such as avacopan (a complement 
5a receptor antagonist) hold promise for lesser toxic induction regimens in the 
future. Increasingly, the risk of cardiovascular events and comorbidities such 
as osteoporosis are being recognized as factors affecting long-term prospects of 
patients with vasculitis. There is a shift in emphasis to utilize 
patient-reported outcomes to more accurately gauge the impact of vasculitides 
and their treatment.

AIM: Current studies demonstrate red blood cell distribution width (RDW) as a 
possible surrogate biomarker of inflammation. The objectives of the present 
study were to examine RDW in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), fibromyalgia 
(FM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) and to evaluate its 
clinical importance.
METHODS: Six hundred and ninety-nine ambulatory patients were evaluated. RDW, 
hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) 
were assessed. In order to compare groups, a Kruskall-Wallis test with post hoc 
Dunn's test was applied. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to 
evaluate anisocytosis explanatory variables.
RESULTS: Red blood cell distribution width values differed significantly among 
groups. Post hoc analysis demonstrated a significant increase in RDW within RA 
versus OA groups (P < 0.001), active SpA versus OA (P < 0.001), RA versus FM (P 
< 0.001) and active SpA versus FM groups (P = 0.001). Presence of anisocytosis 
was useful to discriminate between active articular inflammatory versus 
non-inflammatory diseases with 48-95% sensitivity and 66-95% specificity. 
Multivariate analysis showed a six-fold increase in anisocytosis for the 
presence of a possible articular inflammatory disease.
CONCLUSION: In subjects with articular pain, RDW interpretation is a useful tool 
in clinical practice to distinguish between articular inflammatory and 
non-inflammatory joint diseases, as with CRP. RDW seems to be a surrogate marker 
of the inflammatory process.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether low serum C3 level can cross-sectionally 
estimate severe antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis 
(AAV) in immunosuppressive drug-naïve patients at diagnosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 139 patients with 
AAV, who were first classified as AAV at Severance Hospital. We obtained 
clinical and laboratory data including serum complement 3 (C3) level and 
calculated Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS) at diagnosis. We 
stratified AAV patients into three groups according to the tertile of BVAS and 
defined the lower limit of the highest tertile as the cutoff for severe AAV 
(BVAS at diagnosis ≥ 16) at diagnosis. Low serum C3 level was defined as 
C3 < 90 mg/dL. The odds ratio (OR) was assessed using the multivariable logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 56.3 years and 41 patients were men 
(29.5%). The mean initial BVAS was 12.8. The mean serum C3 and C4 levels were 
110.6 and 26.8 mg/dL. Thirty-one patients (22.3%) exhibited low serum C3 level 
at diagnosis. In the multivariable analysis, serum C3 level at 
diagnosis < 90 mg/dL (OR 2.963) exhibited the significant association with 
severe AAV at diagnosis. Patients with low serum C3 level exhibited a 
significantly high relative risk (RR) for severe AAV at diagnosis compared to 
those without (RR 3.600). Patients with low serum C3 level at diagnosis 
exhibited poor renal prognosis than those without.
CONCLUSION: Low serum C3 level can estimate severe AAV and predict poor renal 
outcome in immunosuppressive drug-naïve patients at diagnosis.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate a miRNA expression profile in 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with DKD (cases) or without this 
complication (controls).
METHODS: Expression of 48 miRNAs was screened in plasma of 58 T1DM patients (23 
controls, 18 with moderate DKD, and 17 with severe DKD) using TaqMan Low Density 
Array cards (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, five of the dysregulated miRNAs 
were selected for validation in an independent sample of 10 T1DM controls and 19 
patients with DKD (10 with moderate DKD and 9 with severe DKD), using RT-qPCR. 
Bioinformatic analyses were performed to explore the putative target genes and 
biological pathways regulated by the validated miRNAs.
RESULTS: Among the 48 miRNAs investigated in the screening analysis, 9 miRNAs 
were differentially expressed between DKD cases and T1DM controls. Among them, 
the five most dysregulated miRNAs were chosen for validation in an independent 
sample. In the validation sample, miR-21-3p and miR-378-3p were confirmed to be 
upregulated in patients with severe DKD, while miR-16-5p and miR-29a-3p were 
downregulated in this group compared to T1DM controls and patients with moderate 
DKD. MiR-503-3p expression was not validated. Bioinformatic analyses indicate 
that the four validated miRNAs regulate genes from PI3K/Akt, fluid shear stress 
and atherosclerosis, AGE-RAGE, TGF-β1, and relaxin signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found four miRNAs differentially expressed in patients 
with severe DKD, providing significant information about the biological pathways 
in which they are involved.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Beta cell function in type 1 diabetes is commonly assessed as 
the average plasma C-peptide concentration over 2 h following a mixed-meal test 
(CPAVE). Monitoring of disease progression and response to disease-modifying 
therapy would benefit from a simpler, more convenient and less costly measure. 
Therefore, we determined whether CPAVE could be reliably estimated from routine 
clinical variables.
METHODS: Clinical and fasting biochemical data from eight randomised therapy 
trials involving participants with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes were used 
to develop and validate linear models to estimate CPAVE and to test their 
accuracy in estimating loss of beta cell function and response to immune 
therapy.
RESULTS: A model based on disease duration, BMI, insulin dose, HbA1c, fasting 
plasma C-peptide and fasting plasma glucose most accurately estimated loss of 
beta cell function (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
[AUROC] 0.89 [95% CI 0.87, 0.92]) and was superior to the commonly used 
insulin-dose-adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c) measure (AUROC 0.72 [95% CI 0.68, 0.76]). 
Model-estimated CPAVE (CPEST) reliably identified treatment effects in 
randomised trials. CPEST, compared with CPAVE, required only a modest (up to 
17%) increase in sample size for equivalent statistical power.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: CPEST, approximated from six variables at a single 
time point, accurately identifies loss of beta cell function in type 1 diabetes 
and is comparable to CPAVE for identifying treatment effects. CPEST could serve 
as a convenient and economical measure of beta cell function in the clinic and 
as a primary outcome measure in trials of disease-modifying therapy in type 1 
diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune liver disease (AILD) includes autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) 
and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC). AILD is often associated with other 
extra-hepatic immune-mediated disorders (EDs), but there are few pediatric 
studies available to date. In this study we evaluated the association between 
AILD and EDs in our pediatric series.
METHODS: In this single centre retrospective study 48 patients (39 AIH and 9 ASC 
children) were evaluated. Thirty-six children were primarily referred to our 
Centre for liver disease suspicion, while the remaining twelve had a previous 
diagnosis of EDs. All the patients were screened for various EDs at AILD 
diagnosis and yearly during the follow-up.
RESULTS: Mean duration of follow-up was 9 years and 1 month. Twenty-two (46%) 
patients had a diagnosis of EDs. Ulcerative colitis (UC) was the most frequent 
EDs (9 patients), followed by autoimmune thyroid disease (5 patients) and celiac 
disease (5 patients). In 7 out of 9 UC patients, ASC was present.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a high association (46%) between AILD and EDs. In 
particular, in 8 out of 9 ASC patients UC was diagnosed (p-value 0.007). It is 
important to look for EDs in AILD children and, conversely, AILD in EDs children 
with abnormal liver function tests.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune multisystem disease that 
commonly affects the kidneys. It is characterized by persistent autoantibody 
production that targets a multitude of self-antigens. B-cells, plasmablasts and 
plasma cells, as the source of these autoantibodies, play a major role in the 
development of lupus nephritis (LN), and are therefore promising therapeutic 
targets. To date, however, randomized clinical trials of B-cell therapies in LN 
have not lived up to expectations, whereas uncontrolled cohort and observational 
studies of B-cell antagonists have been more promising. In this article, we will 
review the current experience with B-cell therapy in LN and highlight the 
pitfalls that may have limited their success. We will conclude by suggesting 
B-cell-centric approaches to the management of LN based on what has been learned 
from the overall B-cell experience in SLE.

Few studies have assessed the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with 
multiple sclerosis (MS). We used 2 large US administrative databases, the Truven 
Health MarketScan Database (2011-2015; Truven Health Analytics Inc., Ann Arbor, 
Michigan) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2007-2011), to identify delivery 
cohorts. MS and pregnancy outcomes (infections, cesarean delivery, preterm 
delivery, poor fetal growth, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, postpartum 
hemorrhage, stillbirth, and infant malformations) were identified during 
pregnancy and at delivery. We calculated adjusted risk ratios according to MS 
status and relapse(s) in the year before delivery. Among over 5 million 
pregnancies, we identified 3,875 pregnancies in women with MS. Women with MS had 
an increased risk of infections during pregnancy (Truven Health: adjusted risk 
ratio (aRR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 1.27) and preterm 
delivery (Truven Health: aRR = 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.35); Nationwide Inpatient 
Sample: aRR = 1.30 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.44)). The risks of other outcomes were 
similar for women with and without MS. In the Truven Health database, risk 
ratios for the pregnancy outcomes in women experiencing relapses versus those 
without relapses were between 0.9 and 1.4, and confidence intervals overlapped 
the null. Overall, women with MS had an increased risk of infections and preterm 
delivery; however, their risks for other adverse pregnancy outcomes were not 
elevated. Disease activity before delivery was not a strong predictor of 
outcomes.

AIM: Interleukin (IL)-7 signalling modulates T cell activity and is implicated 
in numerous autoimmune diseases. The present study investigated the safety, 
pharmacokinetics, target engagement, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of 
GSK2618960, an IL-7 receptor-α subunit (CD127) monoclonal antibody.
METHODS: A double-blind (sponsor-unblind) study of a single intravenous infusion 
of either GSK2618960 (0.6 mg kg-1 or 2.0 mg kg-1 ) or placebo was carried out in 
18 healthy subjects over 24 weeks.
RESULTS: GSK2618960 was well tolerated; there were no serious or significant 
adverse events. The observed half-life was 5 (±1) days (2.0 mg kg-1 ), with 
nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Full receptor occupancy (>95%) was observed until 
day 8 (0.6 mg kg-1 ) and day 22 (2.0 mg kg-1 ). Maximal inhibition of 
IL-7-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) 
phosphorylation was observed in 5/6 subjects until day 22 (2.0 mg kg-1 ). Mean 
circulating IL-7 and soluble receptor (CD127) levels were increased above 
baseline during days 2 and 15 (0.6 mg kg-1 ) and days 2 and 22 (2.0 mg kg-1 ). 
No meaningful changes were observed in absolute numbers or proportions of immune 
cell populations or inflammatory cytokine profiles (IL-6, tumour necrosis 
factor-α, interferon-γ, IL-2). Persistent antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were 
detected in 5/6 subjects administered a dose of 0.6 mg kg-1 (neutralizing in 
2/6) and in 6/6 subjects administered 2.0 mg kg-1 (neutralizing in 5/6).
CONCLUSION: GSK2618960 was well tolerated and blocked IL-7 receptor signalling 
upon full target engagement. Although there was no discernible impact on 
peripheral T cell subsets in healthy subjects, GSK2618960 may effectively 
modulate the autoinflammatory activity of pathogenic T cells in diseased tissue. 
A relatively short half-life is likely the result of target-mediated rather than 
ADA-mediated clearance.

C-peptide is a cleavage product of proinsulin that acts on different type of 
cells, such as blood and endothelial cells. C-peptide biological effects may be 
different in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Besides, there are further evidence for 
a functional interaction between C-peptide and insulin. In this way, C-peptide 
has ambiguous effects, acting as an antithrombotic or thrombotic molecule, 
depending on the physiological environment and disease conditions. Moreover, 
C-peptide regulates interaction of leucocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets with 
the endothelium. The beneficial effects include stimulation of nitric oxide 
production with its subsequent release by platelets and endothelium, the 
interaction with erythrocytes leading to the generation of adenosine 
triphosphate, and inhibition of atherogenic cytokine release. The undesirable 
action of C-peptide includes the chemotaxis of monocytes, lymphocytes, and 
smooth muscle cells. Also, C-peptide was related with increased lipid deposits 
and elevated smooth muscle cells proliferation in the vessel wall, contributing 
to atherosclerosis. Purpose of this review is to explore these dual roles of 
C-peptide on the blood, contributing at one side to haemostasis and the other to 
atherosclerotic process.

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a renal disease with an 
extensive differential diagnosis. This paper reports the case of a 55-year-old 
female patient diagnosed with Hansen's disease with acute progressive renal 
impairment after developing lower limb pyoderma. The association between 
Hansen's and kidney disease has been well documented, with glomerulonephritis 
(GN) ranked as the most common form of renal involvement. Post-infectious 
glomerulonephritis (PIGN) in adults has been associated with a number of 
pathogens occurring in diverse sites. The patient described in this case report 
had RPGN and biopsy findings suggestive of PIGN with C3 and IgA detected on 
immunofluorescence and kidney injury secondary to recent infection by 
Staphylococcus, a well-documented manifestation of renal impairment in patients 
with Hansen's disease.

A Glomerulonefrite Rapidamente Progressiva (GNRP) é um padrão de doença renal 
com amplo diagnóstico diferencial. O caso reporta uma paciente de 55 anos com 
deterioração aguda e progressiva da função renal após quadro de piodermite em 
membro inferior com diagnóstico concomitante de hanseníase. Associação da 
hanseníase com doença renal é bem descrita, sendo a GN a forma de acometimento 
renal mais comum. As glomerulonefrites pós-infecciosas (GNPIs) em adultos 
ocorrem devido a um grande número de patógenos, nos mais diversos sítios. A 
paciente do caso relatado apresentava quadro de GNRP e achados de biópsia que 
sugerem GNPI com marcação de C3 e IgA na imunofluorescência, sugestiva de lesão 
renal secundária a infecção recente por Staphylococcus, uma manifestação bem 
descrita de doença renal em pacientes com hanseníase.

BACKGROUND: Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) exhibits significant 
clinical heterogeneity, but the underlying causes remain unclear. The aim of 
this study was to investigate whether age of onset of LADA contributes to the 
observed clinical heterogeneity by comparing the clinical, metabolic, and 
immunogenetic characteristics between elderly and young LADA patients.
METHODS: The cross-sectional study included a total of 579 patients with LADA 
which was further divided into elderly LADA (E-LADA) group (n = 135, age of 
onset ≥60 years) and young LADA (Y-LADA) group (n = 444, age of onset 
<60 years). Age-matched subjects with type 2 diabetes were served as control 
(E-T2D group, n = 622). Clinical characteristics, serum autoantibodies, and 
HLA-DQ haplotypes were compared among these groups.
RESULTS: Compared with patients with Y-LADA, patients with E-LADA have better 
residual beta-cell function and higher level of insulin resistance (both 
P < .01), more metabolic syndrome characteristics, similar proportion of islet 
autoantibody positivity, and strikingly different HLA-DQ genetic background. In 
comparison with E-T2D patients, E-LADA patients tend to have similar metabolic 
syndrome prevalence, comparable C-peptide levels, and insulin resistance levels 
and share similar HLA-DQ genetic characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly LADA differs phenotypically and genetically from Y-LADA but 
has a clinical and genetic profile more similar to that of E-T2D. These distinct 
phenotypes could potentially help physicians better manage patients with E-LADA.

The Multi-Biomarker Disease Activity (MBDA) score is a validated rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) disease activity measure based on 12 serum biomarkers. Here, we 
evaluate short-term biological variability of MBDA scores to determine the 
magnitude of change that might be considered clinically meaningful. Twenty-eight 
adult seropositive RA patients with clinically stable disease and no changes in 
RA medications for 4 weeks prior to study were enrolled. Nine serum samples were 
obtained over four consecutive days (non-fasting). MBDA score variation was 
assessed day-to-day (daily) and within 24 h (diurnal). The standard deviation 
(SD) of MBDA scores was calculated by a linear mixed model including random 
effects for patient, day, and time of day. The minimally important difference 
(MID) was calculated as [Formula: see text]. A subgroup analysis was performed 
for patients with active RA (moderate or high MBDA score). The SD of MBDA score 
change in the full cohort was 4.7 in a combined daily-diurnal variation 
analysis, which corresponds with an MID of 11. The SD of MBDA score change in 
the subset of patients with active RA (moderate/high MBDA scores) was 3.6. This 
corresponds with an MID of 8 units in patients with active RA for whom 
clinicians are most likely to need guidance with respect to therapeutic 
decisions. Changes in MBDA score ≥ 8 represent a change in RA disease activity 
that clinicians can use as a benchmark for therapeutic drug efficacy and can be 
incorporated into a treat-to-target strategy.

OBJECTIVES: To delineate urine biomarkers that reflect kidney structural damage 
and predict renal functional decline in pediatric lupus nephritis (LN).
METHODS: In this prospective study, we evaluated kidney biopsies and urine 
samples of 89 patients with pediatric LN. Urinary levels of 10 biomarkers 
[adiponectin, ceruloplasmin, kidney injury molecule-1, monocyte chemotactic 
protein-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, osteopontin, transforming 
growth factor-ß (TGFß), vitamin-D binding protein, liver fatty acid binding 
protein (LFABP), and transferrin] were measured. Regression analysis was used to 
identify individual and combinations of biomarkers that determine LN damage 
status [NIH-chronicity index (NIH-CI) score ≤ 1 vs. ≥ 2] both individually and 
in combination, and biomarker levels were compared for patients with vs. without 
renal functional decline, i.e., a 20% reduction of the glomerular filtration 
rate (GFR) within 12 months of a kidney biopsy.
RESULTS: Adiponectin, LFABP, and osteopontin levels differed significantly with 
select histological damage features considered in the NIH-CI. The GFR was 
associated with NIH-CI scores [Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = - 0.49; 
p < 0.0001] but not proteinuria (r = 0.20; p > 0.05). Similar to the GFR [area 
under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.72; p < 0.01], combinations of osteopontin and 
adiponectin levels showed moderate accuracy [AUC = 0.75; p = 0.003] in 
discriminating patients by LN damage status. Renal functional decline occurred 
more commonly with continuously higher levels of the biomarkers, especially of 
TGFß, transferrin, and LFABP.
CONCLUSION: In combination, urinary levels of adiponectin and osteopontin 
predict chronic LN damage with similar accuracy as the GFR. Ongoing LN activity 
as reflected by high levels of LN activity biomarkers heralds renal functional 
decline.
KEY MESSAGES: • Levels of osteopontin and adiponectin measured at the time of 
kidney biopsy are good predictors of histological damage with lupus nephritis. • 
Only about 20% of children with substantial kidney damage from lupus nephritis 
will have an abnormally low urine creatinine clearance. • Continuously high 
levels of biomarkers reflecting lupus nephritis activity are risk factors of 
declining renal function.

In the distal radioulnar joint, the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is 
an important stabilizer and are frequently found in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) with wrist pain. This study was designed to predict TFCC tears 
using high-resolution ultrasound in severe RA. We retrospectively reviewed 
patients with severe RA. MRI and ultrasound were performed at baseline and after 
1 year of follow-up. TFCC tears were recorded. The predictive factors for TFCC 
tears were analyzed by logistic regression. During the 1-year follow-up period, 
54 patients were enrolled (42 females and 12 males), of whom 21 (38.9%) 
developed TFCC tears. The body mass index was 22.81±2.59 kg/m2 in the TFCC tear 
group compared with 23.61±2.76 kg/m2 in the non-tear group (p=0.136). The mean 
age was 55.14±9.54 years in the TFCC tear group compared with 56.45±14.04 years 
in the non-tear group (p=0.596). The tear group had a higher Disease Activity 
Score in 28 joints (DAS28) (6.36±0.47 vs 5.58±0.65, p=0.011) and higher power 
Doppler (PD) ultrasound score at the dorsal radiocarpal joint (1.90±1.30 vs 
1.33±0.99, p=0.011) than the non-tear group. We found that high DAS28 (OR 2.96, 
95% CI 1.95 to 4.50; p=0.001) and higher baseline PD score (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 
to 2.14; p=0.019) were significantly associated with a higher risk of TFCC tears 
by logistic regression. So we conclude a higher wrist PD score in severe RA 
predicted future TFCC tears. Therefore, we suggest to use PD score in such 
patients to monitor the risk of future TFCC tears.

BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a potential therapy for various 
diseases. Here, the results of intrathecal injection of MSCs in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) patients are reported.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients were enrolled in the study. Three were male 
and one was female. There were three secondary-progressive MS patients and one 
relapsing-remitting MS patient. An amount of 50-80 ml of bone marrow was 
collected from the patients. MSC cultures were collected for each 
microbiological examination at each change of medium and passage as well as at 
the time of sample injection. Then, MSCs were injected into the patients by the 
intrathecal method. In two patients, the injection was replicated in 1 year.
RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for 2 years. Three patients who had 
secondary progression did not show disease progress after the injection, and the 
disease entered a stable state. A degree of recovery was observed in two 
patients. The relapsing-remitting patient suffered an attack that led to 
corticosteroid injection. None of the patients reported side effects. In terms 
of magnetic resonance imaging, there were no new plaques or enhanced plaques.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that injection of MSC can be a suitable method, 
especially for secondary-progressive patients. It seems that reinjection of 
these stem cells can be safe and sustaining it positively increases the effects 
of this therapeutic approach.

damage in lesions and normal appearing gray and white matter in multiple 
sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting the human 
central nervous system (CNS) and leading to neurologic disability. Although 
conventional MRI techniques can readily detect focal white matter (WM) lesions, 
it remains challenging to quantify tissue damage in normal-appearing gray matter 
(GM) and WM.
PURPOSE: To demonstrate that a new MRI biomarker, R2t*, can provide quantitative 
analysis of tissue damage across the brain in MS patients in a single scan.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
SUBJECTS: Forty-four MS patients and 19 healthy controls (HC).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T, quantitative gradient-recalled-echo (qGRE), 
Magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery.
ASSESSMENT: Severity of tissue damage was assessed by reduced R2t*. Tissue 
atrophy was assessed by cortical thickness and cervical spinal cord 
cross-sectional area (CSA). Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite was used for 
clinical assessment.
RESULTS: R2t* in cortical GM was more sensitive to MS damage than cortical 
atrophy. Using more than two standard deviations (SD) reduction versus 
age-matched HC as the cutoff, 48% of MS patients showed lower R2t*, versus only 
9% with lower cortical thickness. Significant correlations between severities of 
tissue injury were identified among 1) upper cervical cord and several cortical 
regions, including motor cortex (P < 0.001), and 2) adjacent regions of GM and 
subcortical WM (P < 0.001). R2t*-defined tissue cellular damage in cortical GM 
was greater relative to adjacent WM. Reductions in cortical R2t* correlated with 
cognitive impairment (P < 0.01). Motor-related clinical signs correlated most 
with cervical cord CSA (P < 0.001).
DATA CONCLUSION: Reductions in R2t* within cortical GM was more sensitive to 
tissue damage than atrophy, potentially allowing a reduced sample size in 
clinical trials. R2t* together with structural morphometry suggested topographic 
patterns of regions showing correlated tissue damage throughout the brain and 
the cervical spinal cord of MS patients.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical and 
prognostic features of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 
antibody-associated demyelination with different onset phenotypes.
METHODS: A total of 52 MOG-IgG-seropositive patients were divided into four 
groups: (i) optic neuritis (ON) at onset (MOG-ON+ , n = 23), (ii) transverse 
myelitis (TM) at onset (MOG-TM+ , n = 12), (iii) pure brain symptoms at onset 
(MOG-ON- -TM- , n = 14) and (iv) both ON and TM at onset (n = 3). This final 
group was not included in further analyses. Data were collected through medical 
records and regular follow-up.
RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 24 (range, 3-63) years in the whole 
cohort (50% female). MOG-ON- -TM- patients had the youngest age of onset across 
the three groups. Patients with MOG-TM+ tended to relapse more frequently and 
had a longer interval to first relapse than was observed in MOG-ON+ and MOG-ON- 
-TM- patients. High MOG-IgG titres were associated with increased cerebrospinal 
fluid leukocytes. The likelihood of harbouring transient, low MOG-IgG titres was 
higher in the MOG-TM+ group than in the other groups. After a median disease 
duration of 20 months, most but not all cases had a favourable outcome, with 8% 
developing severe visual deficit, 2% becoming wheelchair-dependent and 6% 
developing cognitive impairment. The onset phenotype appeared to be an important 
predictor of disability type. Having high MOG-IgG titres (odds ratio, 0.168, 
P = 0.027) or female gender (odds ratio, 0.270, P = 0.067) was associated with a 
lower likelihood of complete recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Onset phenotype may influence long-term presentation, MOG-IgG 
status as well as outcome. Further large and prospective studies are needed to 
better clarify the clinical implications of the first demyelinating event.

hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the emergence and pathogenicity of 
these autoantibodies are still incompletely understood. The aim of this study 
was to analyze the antigen specificities and mutation patterns of monoclonal 
antibodies (mAb) derived from RA synovial plasma cells and address the question 
of antigen cross-reactivity.
METHODS: IgG-secreting cells were isolated from RA synovial fluid, and the 
variable regions of the immunoglobulins were sequenced (n = 182) and expressed 
in full-length mAb (n = 93) and also as germline-reverted versions. The patterns 
of reactivity with 53,019 citrullinated peptides and 49,211 carbamylated 
peptides and the potential of the mAb to promote osteoclastogenesis were 
investigated.
RESULTS: Four unrelated anti-citrullinated protein autoantibodies (ACPAs), of 
which one was clonally expanded, were identified and found to be highly 
somatically mutated in the synovial fluid of a patient with RA. The ACPAs 
recognized >3,000 unique peptides modified by either citrullination or 
carbamylation. This highly multireactive autoantibody feature was replicated for 
Ig sequences derived from B cells from the peripheral blood of other RA 
patients. The plasma cell-derived mAb were found to target distinct amino acid 
motifs and partially overlapping protein targets. They also conveyed different 
effector functions as revealed in an osteoclast activation assay.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the high level of cross-reactivity among 
RA autoreactive B cells is the result of different antigen encounters, possibly 
at different sites and at different time points. This is consistent with the 
notion that RA is initiated in one context, such as in the mucosal organs, and 
thereafter targets other sites, such as the joints.

OBJECTIVE: Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe, 
lifelong, multisystem autoimmune disease. Long-term outcome data are limited. 
This study was undertaken to identify clinical characteristics and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adults with childhood-onset SLE.
METHODS: Patients participated in a single study visit comprising a structured 
history and physical examination. Disease activity (scored using the SLE Disease 
Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K]), damage (scored using the Systemic Lupus 
International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage 
Index [SDI]), and HRQoL (scored using the Short Form 36 Health Survey) were 
assessed. Medical records were reviewed.
RESULTS: In total, 111 childhood-onset SLE patients were included; the median 
disease duration was 20 years, 91% of patients were female, and 72% were white. 
Disease activity was low (median SLEDAI-2K score 4), and 71% of patients 
received prednisone, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and/or other disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs. The vast majority of new childhood-onset SLE-related 
manifestations developed within 2 years of diagnosis. Damage such as myocardial 
infarctions began occurring after 5 years. Most patients (62%) experienced 
damage, predominantly in the musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, and renal 
systems. Cerebrovascular accidents, renal transplants, replacement 
arthroplasties, and myocardial infarctions typically occurred at a young age 
(median age 20 years, 24 years, 34 years, and 39 years, respectively). 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that damage accrual was 
associated with disease duration (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, P < 0.001), 
antiphospholipid antibody positivity (OR 3.56, P = 0.026), and hypertension (OR 
3.21, P = 0.043). Current HCQ monotherapy was associated with an SDI score of 0 
(OR 0.16, P = 0.009). In this cohort, HRQoL was impaired compared to the overall 
Dutch population. The presence of damage reduced HRQoL scores in 1 domain. High 
disease activity (SLEDAI-2K score ≥8) and changes in physical appearance 
strongly reduced HRQoL scores (in 4 of 8 domains and 7 of 8 domains, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: The majority of adults with childhood-onset SLE in this large cohort 
developed significant damage at a young age and had impaired HRQoL without 
achieving drug-free remission, illustrating the substantial impact of 
childhood-onset SLE on future life.

OBJECTIVE: Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) develop many years 
before the clinical onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was 
undertaken to address the molecular basis of the specificity and 
cross-reactivity of ACPAs from patients with RA.
METHODS: Antibodies isolated from RA patients were expressed as monoclonal 
chimeric antibodies with mouse Fc. These antibodies were characterized for 
glycosylation using mass spectrometry, and their cross-reactivity was assessed 
using Biacore and Luminex immunoassays. The crystal structures of the 
antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the monoclonal ACPA E4 in complex with 3 
different citrullinated peptides were determined using x-ray crystallography. 
The prevalence of autoantibodies reactive against 3 of the citrullinated 
peptides that also interacted with E4 was investigated by Luminex immunoassay in 
2 Swedish cohorts of RA patients.
RESULTS: Analysis of the crystal structures of a monoclonal ACPA from human RA 
serum in complex with citrullinated peptides revealed key residues of several 
complementarity-determining regions that recognized the citrulline as well as 
the neighboring peptide backbone, but with limited contact with the side chains 
of the peptides. The same citrullinated peptides were recognized by high titers 
of serum autoantibodies in 2 large cohorts of RA patients.
CONCLUSION: These data show, for the first time, how ACPAs derived from human RA 
serum recognize citrulline. The specific citrulline recognition and 
backbone-mediated interactions provide a structural explanation for the 
promiscuous recognition of citrullinated peptides by RA-specific ACPAs.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by 
immune-mediated inflammation, which attacks the myelin sheath. MS pursues a 
relapsing and remitting course with varying intervals between symptoms. The main 
clinical pathological features include inflammation, myelin sheath destruction 
and plaque formation in the central nervous system (CNS). We previously reported 
that cystatin F (CysF) expression is induced in demyelinating lesions that are 
accompanied by active remyelination (referred to as shadow plaques) but is 
down-regulated in chronic demyelinated lesions (plaques) in the spinal cord of 
MS patients and in several murine models of demyelinating disease. CysF is a 
cathepsin protease inhibitor whose major target is cathepsin C (CatC), which is 
co-expressed in demyelinating regions in Plp4e/- mice, a model of chronic 
demyelination. Here, we report the time course of CatC and CysF expression and 
describe the symptoms in a mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 
model using CatC knockdown (KD) and CatC over-expression (OE) mice. In myelin 
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-EAE, CatC positive cells were found to 
infiltrate the CNS at an early stage prior to any clinical signs, in comparison 
to WT mice. CysF expression was not observed at this early stage, but appeared 
later within shadow plaques. CatC expression was found in chronic demyelinated 
lesions but was not associated with CysF expression, and CatCKD EAE mouse showed 
delayed demyelination. Whereas, CatCOE in microglia significantly increased 
severity of demyelination in the MOG-EAE model. Thus, these results demonstrate 
that CatC plays a major role in MOG-EAE.

OBJECTIVE: In multiple sclerosis (MS), deep grey matter (DGM) atrophy has been 
recognised as a crucial component of the disease that presents early and it has 
been associated with disability. Although the precise mechanism underlying grey 
matter atrophy is unknown, several hypotheses have been postulated. Our previous 
research pointed to correlations of hypothalamic metabolic alterations with 
clinical outcomes of MS, therefore we decided to further test the relationship 
of these alterations with DGM atrophy.
METHODS: We used 1H-Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the hypothalamus 
to test its metabolites in 26 patients with RRMS and 22 healthy age-matched 
controls. DGM atrophy was evaluated by simple planimetry of third ventricular 
width on the hypothalamic level (3VW) in T1 weighted MRI pictures. Metabolite 
ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), glutamate and glutamine 
(Glx), myo-inositol (mIns) and creatine (Cr) were correlated with Multiple 
Sclerosis Severity Scale (MSSS) and 3VW.
RESULTS: Metabolite concentrations were compared between patients and controls 
using multiple regression models allowing for age, 3VW and metabolites. It 
revealed that the only relevant predictors of MSSS were 3VW and Glx/NAA. At a 
significance level of P<0.05, a unit increase of 3VW was associated with a 0.35 
increase of MSSS, for a typical value of Glx/NAA; P value 0.0039. A unit 
increase of Glx/NAA was associated with a 0.93 increase of MSSS, for a typical 
value of atrophy; P value 0.090. There were significant linear correlations 
between Glx/Cr and MSSS, Glx/NAA and MSSS, and between mIns/NAA and 3VW.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that both NAA and Glx are associated with 
neurodegeneration of hypothalamic DGM and severe disease course. Glx related 
1H-MRS parameters seem to be superior to other metabolites in determining 
disease burden, independently of otherwise powerful 3VW planimetry. 
Significantly increased mIns/NAA in MS patients compared to controls point to 
gliosis, which parallels the atrophy of hypothalamic DGM.

Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of 
etanercept (ETA) in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) under the 
age of 4 years and to compare the data with those for older age groups. Methods: 
Three groups comprising 34 patients each (total of 102 patients) were selected 
using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. The study group (patients 
under the age of 4 years; the Junior group (JNR)) was compared with patients of 
the older age groups, adjusted for criteria such as gender, JIA category, JIA 
severity, and either age at disease onset (the Reference by Age of disease Onset 
(RAO) group) or disease duration (the Reference by Disease Duration (RDD) 
group). Results: All three groups showed a good response to ETA therapy. During 
the follow-up period, only 4 (3.9%) patients failed to reach American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric criteria improvement at ACR50 level. In the JNR 
group, 82.4% of patients achieved ACR90 within a median time of 3 months (IQR, 
3-6 months), which was a better result compared to the other two groups: 61.8% 
(RAO group) and 58.8% (RDD group) of patients achieved ACR90 within 6 
(Interquartile Range (IQR), 3-9) months (p = .028). Three (9%) patients in the 
JNR group and none of the RDD and RAO groups discontinued treatment because of 
clinical remission (p = .045). Conclusion: An analysis of the ETA efficacy in 
different age groups comparable in terms of the diagnosis and disease severity 
demonstrated a higher efficacy of earlier ETA therapy in children of the same 
age at disease onset. In children at the early stage of arthritis (≤ 2.5 years 
long), ETA was more efficient in those with an earlier disease onset.

BACKGROUND: Both vitamin D preparations and high-dose statin therapy were found 
to reduce thyroid antibody titers.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether vitamin D status 
determines the effect of statin therapy on thyroid autoimmunity.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 39 euthyroid women with Hashimoto's 
thyroiditis and moderate or moderately high cardiovascular risk divided into two 
groups: women with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (group A; n=19) and 
women with normal vitamin D status (group B, n=20). All patients received 
atorvastatin therapy (20-40 mg daily) for the following 6 months. Plasma lipids, 
circulating levels of thyrotropin, free thyroid hormones, prolactin and 
25-hydroxyvitamin D, titers of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, 
as well as Jostel's, the SPINA-GT and the SPINA-GD indices were assessed at the 
beginning and at the end of the study.
RESULTS: The study completed all women. At baseline, with the exception of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D, there were no significant differences between both study 
groups in plasma lipids, circulating hormone levels and titers of thyroid 
peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies. Despite improving plasma lipids in both 
study groups, atorvastatin reduced thyroid antibody titers only in women with 
normal vitamin D status. Moreover, in this group of patients, atorvastatin 
increased the SPINA-GT index. Circulating levels of the measured hormones, 
Jostel's thyrotropin index and the SPINA-GD index remained at a similar level 
throughout the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest that the effect of atorvastatin 
therapy on thyroid autoimmunity depends on vitamin D status.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex multifactorial disease characterized by 
autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. Our 
understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and natural history of T1D has 
evolved significantly over the past two decades; we can efficiently predict 
high-risk individuals, early diagnose the disease and stage progression. 
Fortuitously, novel in vitro differentiation protocols for generating functional 
β-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells have been developed. These 
advances provide a definitive roadmap to implement realistic preventive and 
β-cell replacement therapies in T1D. Immunoprotection and preservation of 
functional β-cell mass are a sine qua non for the success of these 
interventions. The chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha, known as 
CXCL12-α, is an attractive therapeutic target molecule in this context. CXCL12-α 
signaling promotes β-cell development, survival and regeneration and can mediate 
local immunomodulation in the pancreatic islets. Interestingly, CXCL12-α is 
robustly expressed in maturing insulin-producing β cells and in adult β cells 
during periods of injury and regeneration. However, under normal physiological 
settings, CXCL12-α is repressed in terminally differentiated mature β cells and 
islets. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of CXCL12-α 
signaling in β-cell biology, physiology and immune regulation. We discuss 
CXCL12-α signaling mechanisms that could be harnessed to modulate β-cell 
autoimmunity, protect and preserve functional β-cell mass and for cell 
replacement therapy in T1D.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to define the risk of serious bacterial 
infections in patients receiving specific biological disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and evaluating the effect of concomitant 
synthetic DMARDs (sDMARDs) in a large population-based sample of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) deriving from an administrative health database.
METHODS: Data were extracted from health databases of Lombardy Region, Italy 
(2004-2013), as a part of the RECord-linkage On Rheumatic Diseases (RECORD) 
study. Patients with RA treated with approved bDMARDs were included. 
Hospitalisations for bacterial infections were evaluated by hospital discharge 
forms. The association between drug exposure and infections was assessed by 
survival models, with time-dependent covariates. Results are presented as hazard 
ratios (HR) and 95%CI, crude and adjusted for pre-specified confounders (sex, 
age, disease duration, Charlson Comorbidity Index, previous biologics, previous 
infections, use of methotrexate, leflunomide, corticosteroids, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs).
RESULTS: 4,656 RA patients with at least one bDMARD prescription were included, 
for a total of 7,601 biological courses; 3,603 (77.4%) women with a mean (SD) 
age of 55.8 (12.7) years. Crude incidence rate of hospitalised infection ranged 
from 0.14 to 2.95 per 1000 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, 
abatacept users (HR 0.29, 95%CI 0.10-0.82) had significantly lower risk of 
infections compared to etanercept. Concurrent treatment with methotrexate (0.72, 
0.52-0.99) reduced the overall risk of infection while glucocorticoids increased 
it (1.09 per mg/day, 1.06-1.11).
CONCLUSIONS: In RA patients treated with bDMARDs, abatacept was associated with 
the lowest risk of infections; overall risk was mitigated by concomitant 
methotrexate and increased by glucocorticoids in a dose-dependent manner.

in ATTEST and AMPLE. In AMPLE, patients received subcutaneous abatacept or 
adalimumab (2 years). In ATTEST, patients received intravenous abatacept or 
infliximab (1 year), or placebo (6 months) then abatacept (6 months); at 1 year, 
all patients could receive abatacept (open-label long-term extension). Serum 
ANA/anti-dsDNA autoantibody levels were measured at baseline, Month 6 (ATTEST 
only), Years 1 and 2.
RESULTS: At baseline, 25.7 and 0.9% (AMPLE), and 21.6 and 8.4% of patients 
(ATTEST) were ANA/anti-dsDNA autoantibody positive, respectively. More baseline 
ANA/anti-dsDNA autoantibody-negative patients became positive during TNFi than 
abatacept treatment. In ATTEST (TNFi group), 48.5% (48/99; ANA) and 48.3% 
(57/118; anti-dsDNA) of patients seroconverted to positive status by Year 1, 
falling to 22.4% (22/98 ANA) and 13.3% (15/113; anti-dsDNA) by Year 2 after 
switching to abatacept. Of ANA/anti-dsDNA autoantibody-positive patients at Year 
1, 41.9% and 68.9%, were negative at Year 2.
CONCLUSIONS: ANA/anti-dsDNA seroconversion was more frequent with TNFi than 
abatacept therapy; TNFi-associated seroconversion decreased after switching from 
TNFi to abatacept.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased cardiovascular 
risk, secondary to endothelial dysfunction. There is accumulating evidence that 
methotrexate reduces cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis, but the 
mechanisms involved are still unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the 
effect of methotrexate on endothelial function and traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors in the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model.
METHODS: On the first signs of arthritis, methotrexate (1 mg/kg/week, s.c.) or 
saline (Vehicle) was administered to AIA for 3 weeks. Endothelial function was 
studied in aortic rings relaxed with acetylcholine in the presence or not of 
inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, arginase, EDHF and 
superoxide anions production. Arthritis and radiological scores, blood pressure 
and blood levels of cytokines, triglycerides, cholesterol, homocysteine and 
BMP-4 were measured.
RESULTS: Although methotrexate significantly reduced the arthritis score, it had 
no effect on Ach-induced relaxation. As regards mechanisms, methotrexate 
increased nitric oxide synthase activity and reduced the superoxide anions 
production but did not change arginase, cyclooxygenase-2 and EDHF pathways. 
Methotrexate did not change the radiological score or blood pressure, lipid, 
glucose and homocysteine levels. By contrast, methotrexate significantly reduced 
plasma IL-1β and TNF-α levels and increased serum BMP-4 level.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction of clinical and biological inflammation, 
methotrexate did not improve endothelial function in AIA rats. Overall data 
suggest that mechanisms other than the ED reduction are likely involved, and 
remain to be elucidated to better understand the cardiovascular benefits of 
methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term outcomes of RA patients in sustained 
clinical remission under different therapeutic strategies and explore the risk 
factors to relapse.
METHODS: RA patients in sustained clinical remission (DAS28(CRP) ≤2.6 for at 
least 6 months) were enrolled. Their baseline clinical features, ultrasonography 
and x-ray of hands were collected. The usage of conventional synthetic 
disease-modified anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) at baseline and every follow-up 
visits were recorded. Patients were divided into maintain-therapy group or 
de-escalate-therapy group according to their treatment during follow-up. The 
time-point of follow-up visits reaching 2 years or flare (DAS28(CRP)>2.6) was 
defined as the endpoint of the study. The risk factors to predict flare was 
analysed by logistic regression model.
RESULTS: 94 patients were enrolled in the study, with 59 in de-escalate-therapy 
group and 35 in maintain-therapy group. During an average of 20.8 months of 
follow-up, 40 (42.6%) patients relapsed, with 31 (52.5%) from 
de-escalate-therapy group and 9 (25.7%) from maintain-therapy group. 
De-escalate-therapy increased the risk of flare by 2.3 times (OR=3.38, p=0.044). 
Baseline DAS28(CRP) (OR=6.97, p=0.038), presence of subclinical synovitis 
(OR=3.67, p=0.024), combination of 2 csDMARDs (OR=3.72, p=0.030) were the risk 
factors for relapse, and the best cut-off value of DAS28(CRP) for relapse 
prediction through ROC curve was 1.82. Taking the three parameters into the 
model for a combined prediction probability, the area under the ROC curve was 
0.722 (95% CI 0.61, 0.82, p=0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: De-escalation therapy was associated with higher risk of relapse in 
RA patients with sustained clinical remission. A combination model of 
DAS28(CRP)<1.82 and no subclinical synovitis may help to predict successful 
csDMARDs reduction in RA patients with sustained clinical remission receiving 
csDMARDs monotherapy.

A 40-year-old man who was diagnosed with bronchial asthma and eosinophilia was 
transferred to our hospital due to a worsening respiratory status. He was 
diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and 
eosinophilic pneumoniae. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging indicated 
Löffler endocarditis. Treatment was initiated using intravenous 
methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and heparin as anticoagulation therapy. 
Three months later, CMR showed the improvement of the LV myocardium. In this 
case, the early diagnosis of Löffler endocarditis by CMR could prevent systemic 
embolism and CMR was useful for assessing the curative effects of steroid and 
immunosuppressant therapy.

A 44-year-old man who received allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
after being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia developed nephrosis when the 
dose of tacrolimus was tapered. A renal biopsy showed the granular deposition of 
immunoglobulin G in the glomerular basement membrane and subepithelial 
electron-dense deposits, crescent formation, C4d-positive staining of the 
peritubular capillary, and subendothelial swelling, suggesting that the main 
pathological diagnosis was membranous nephropathy and that chronic 
graft-versus-host disease played a role in the etiology of nephrosis. We herein 
report a case of membranous nephropathy with various pathological findings. C4d 
deposition suggests complement activation and the involvement of humoral 
factors.

Abatacept, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 immunoglobulin recombinant fusion 
protein, is an immunosuppressive agent indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. 
Although no significant increase in malignancy has been reported in 
abatacept-treated patients, whether or not abatacept accelerates tumor 
progression in specific cancer types remains unclear. We herein report a 
66-year-old woman who showed unusually rapid progression of hepatocellular 
carcinoma following abatacept therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Abatacept was 
speculated to have accelerated her hepatocellular carcinoma progression in the 
setting of her preexisting risk factors: autoimmune hepatitis and long-term 
methotrexate use. We propose close tumor surveillance be performed during 
abatacept therapy, especially for high-risk patients.

A 60-year-old male patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) was admitted for 
glycemic control. The patient exhibited abdominal adiposity, osteoporosis, and 
high insulin requirement (>100 U), and we suspected hypogonadism. A physical 
examination revealed small testes and thin pubic hair, laboratory examination 
found high luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
levels and low testosterone levels, and a chromosome analysis (47, XXY) 
indicated hypogonadism due to Klinefelter syndrome (KS). KS is associated with 
autoimmune diseases and patients positive for diabetes related auto-antibodies. 
In male patients with T1DM and abdominal adiposity, the concurrence of KS should 
be taken into consideration.

AIMS: Incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is increasing worldwide. We 
aimed to study trends in presentation and incidence of childhood diabetes in the 
last 15years in south-western Iran.
METHODS: During a detailed review of compiled records of the main tertiary 
children's hospital of southwest of Iran, from January 2000 to December 2009, 
the following clinical information relevant to diabetes were analysed: 
admissions, demographic data, clinical and laboratory findings, hospital course, 
and mortality. Study continued 5years more to find out the real rate of 
increase. Significant findings with respect to the incidence of DKA, gender and 
age of subjects were summarized from among these cases. A total of 297 (known 
and new) cases were enrolled in the 1st (10year) stage of study and 691 new 
subjects in the 2nd (5year) period to check the trend in the whole 15year study 
period.
RESULTS: In the 1st period; excluding 129 repeated admissions, 297 cases were 
enrolled for analysis: 223 new and 74 known cases. Among the new cases, 67.3% 
presented with DKA, without any gender bias. Mortality rate in DKA subjects was 
4% with higher risk in the <2year group and in girls (boy: girl=1:7; p=0.039). 
Adding the 2nd study period (total 15years) disclosed a rapid rise of incidence 
(new cases/5year) as 89, 134 and 691 new diabetes cases for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd 
5year period of study respectively. The final annual incidence for <15year age 
group in 2015 was 13.35/100000.
CONCLUSIONS: The most new cases of T1DM presented with DKA, which is similar to 
the other developing countries. Such an increasing incidence of DM proposes more 
attention for periodic retraining of families and health staff to earlier 
diagnosis and management of new subjects, and to reduce morbidity and mortality 
rates.

AIM: To investigate the association between structured self-monitoring of blood 
glucose (SMBG) and diabetes self-efficacy in Chinese patients.
METHODS: This study was a single-centre, open-label, prospective, randomized 
controlled trial. A total of 250 type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients were 
recruited and randomly assigned to the structured SMBG group and the control 
group in a 1:1 ratio. The main outcome observed in this subgroup analysis was a 
change in the diabetes self-efficacy scale (DSES) scores. A multivariate 
generalized estimating equation was used to evaluate factors affecting the DSES 
scores.
RESULTS: We found that the DSES scores tended to decrease significantly with the 
follow-up time in the intervention group (Wald β = 7.882, P < .001; Wald 
β = 3.130, P = .003; Wald β = 7.879, P < .001). However, no significant 
differences in the DSES scores were detected in the control group. Glycaemic 
control improved in both the intervention and control groups at the third month 
(P < .05). In the intervention group, sustained improvement of the DSES scores 
maintained the improvement in glycaemic control through the sixth month. In the 
control group, glycaemic control tended to deteriorate in the sixth month 
without the support of an improved DSES scores (P = .056).
CONCLUSION: Structured SMBG could contribute to the effective and persistent 
improvement of diabetes self-efficacy. (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02225691).

Autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD), or primary adrenocortical insufficiency, is 
a classical organ-specific autoimmune disease with 160 years of history. AAD is 
remarkably homogeneous with one major dominant self-antigen, the cytochrome P450 
21-hydroxylase enzyme, which is targeted by both autoantibodies and autoreactive 
T cells. Like most autoimmune diseases, AAD is thought to be caused by an 
unfortunate combination of genetic and environmental factors. While the number 
of genetic associations with AAD is increasing, almost nothing is known about 
environmental factors. A major environmental factor commonly proposed for 
autoimmune diseases, based partly on experimental and clinical data and partly 
on shared pathways between anti-viral immunity and autoimmunity, is viral 
infections. However, there are few reports associating viral infections to AAD, 
and it has proved difficult to establish which immunological processes that 
could link any viral infection with the initiation or progression of AAD. In 
this review, we will summarize the current knowledge on the underlying 
mechanisms of AAD and take a closer look on the potential involvement of 
viruses.

It is well accepted that Th17 cells are a highly plastic cell subset that can be 
easily directed toward the Th1 phenotype in vitro and also in vivo during 
inflammation. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding the reverse 
plasticity (conversion from Th1 to Th17). We show here that ectopic ROR-γt 
expression can restore or initiate IL-17 expression by non-classic or classic 
Th1 cells, respectively, while common pro-Th17 cytokine cocktails are 
ineffective. This stability of the Th1 phenotype is at least partially due to 
the presence of a molecular machinery governed by the transcription factor 
Eomes, which promotes IFN-γ secretion while inhibiting the expression of ROR-γt 
and IL-17. By using a mouse model of T cell-dependent colitis we demonstrate 
that Eomes controls non-classic Th1 cell development also in vivo and promotes 
their pathogenic potential. Eomes expression associates to a highly inflammatory 
phenotype also in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Indeed, it favors 
the acquisition of a cytotoxic signature, and promotes the development of IFN-γ+ 
GM-CSF+ cells that have been described to be pathogenic in chronic inflammatory 
disorders.

Early diagnosis and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) is crucial for 
preventing ischemic complications. Multiple serological markers have been 
identified; however, there is a distinct lack of predicting markers for GCA 
relapse and complications. Our main objective was to identify serological 
parameters in a large cohort of treatment-naïve GCA patients, which could 
support clinicians in evaluating the course of the disease. Clinical data was 
gathered, along with analyte detection using Luminex technology, ELISA, and 
nephelometry, among others. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal 
component analysis of analyte profiles were performed to determine delineation 
of GCA patients and healthy blood donors (HBDs). Highest, significantly elevated 
analytes in GCA patients were SAA (83-fold > HBDs median values), IL-23 
(58-fold), and IL-6 (11-fold). Importantly, we show for the first time 
significantly changed levels of MARCO, alpha-fetoprotein, protein C, resistin, 
TNC, TNF RI, M-CSF, IL-18, and IL-31 in GCA versus HBDs. Changes in levels of 
SAA, CRP, haptoglobin, ESR, MMP-1 and MMP-2, and TNF-alpha were found associated 
with relapse and visual disturbances. aCL IgG was associated with limb artery 
involvement, even following adjustment for multiple testing. Principal component 
analysis revealed clear delineation between HBDs and GCA patients. Our study 
reveals biomarker clusters in a large cohort of patients with GCA and emphasizes 
the importance of using groups of serological biomarkers, such as acute phase 
proteins, MMPs, and cytokines (e.g. TNF-alpha) that could provide crucial 
insight into GCA complications and progression, leading to a more personalized 
disease management.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic immune-mediated liver 
injury caused by dysregulated immune response to liver antigens. Genetic 
susceptibility is affected by multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
immune-related genes. There are few reports on the association of TGF-β and 
IL-10 genetic variants with autoimmune hepatitis.
METHODS: Allele frequency and genotype status of IL-10 -1082, -819, -592 and 
TGF-β +869 and +915 polymorphisms were investigated in 57 unrelated patients 
with autoimmune hepatitis and 140 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction 
with sequence-specific primers.
RESULTS: IL-10 -592 and -819 allele frequencies and genotypes were not 
associated with autoimmune hepatitis in our population, while IL-10 -1082 
genotypes were. IL-10 -1082/-819/-592 "high-producing" haplotype GCC was 
significantly less frequent in patients. TGF-β +869 "high-producing" allele C 
and genotype CC were significantly more in autoimmune hepatitis, compared to 
controls; whereas, TGF-β +915 "low-producing" allele C and genotype CC were 
significantly more in autoimmune hepatitis compared to control. TGF-β +869/+915 
haplotype TG was significantly less frequent in patients while CC haplotype was 
significantly more frequently observed in patients.
CONCLUSION: We identified a significant association between IL-10 -1082/-819 and 
TGF-β +869/+915 genotypes and haplotypes with autoimmune hepatitis in Iranians.

Aim of this study is to examine caregiver burden and family functioning in 
different neurological conditions. Forty-two primary caregivers of patients with 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's Disease and other dementia 
(AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Acquired Brain Injuries (ABI) and Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS) were administered scales for the evaluation of caregiver burden 
(CBI) and family functioning (FACES IV). Caregiver burden was overall high, with 
caregivers of patients with ALS and ABI having exceeded the CBI cut-off score 
for possible burn-out. The average scores of caregivers of patients with AD or 
other dementia and PD were close to the cut-off score, whereas those of 
caregivers of patients with MS were significantly lower than the others. Family 
cohesion, family satisfaction and the quality of family communication were 
associated with reduced levels of caregiver burden, whereas disengagement was 
associated with a higher burden. The data from the present study confirm that 
caregiver burden is a relevant issue in the context of neurological diseases, 
especially for those causing higher degrees of impairment. Significant 
correlations with family functioning emerged as well, highlighting the 
importance of studying and treating caregiver burden within the context of 
family relations.

Several case reports and cohort studies have recently investigated the potential 
association between bullous pemphigoid (BP) and psoriasis. It has been 
speculated that chronic inflammation in the dermo-epidermal junction can trigger 
exposure to antigens to autoreactive T cells, resulting in autoimmune blistering 
disease. However, the association described has been inconsistently reported 
amongst studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
investigation this potential association. We identified four case-control 
studies for inclusion in the present meta-analysis, with a total of 4035 bullous 
pemphigoid cases and 19 215 control cases. There was a significantly higher 
prevalence of psoriasis in BP compared to controls (2.6% vs 1.1%, OR 2.5, 95% CI 
1.4-4.6). Subgroup analysis showed that this association remained significant in 
both males (3.0% vs 1.3%, OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.6) as well as females (1.9% vs 
0.7%, OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-5.9). A significantly higher proportion of cases were 
reported in males (3.0% vs 1.9%, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.1-2.7). This pooled analysis 
of existing case-control studies to date demonstrates a significant association 
between BP and psoriasis. We also showed that in contrast with the majority of 
autoimmune diseases which are predisposed in females, that the coexistence of BP 
and psoriasis appears to be predisposed in male patients.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare autoimmune bullous disease which affects the 
skin and mucous membranes. Oesophageal involvement is rare and has previously 
been limited to case reports and case series. A recent large case series of 477 
PV patients showed that 26/477 (5.4%) had symptomatic oesophageal involvement. 
We present the case of a 54-year-old Somalian lady with a 10-year history of 
cutaneous PV, currently in remission, who developed dysphagia and odynophagia 
and was subsequently found to have oesophageal PV involvement with multiple 
flaccid bullae which were positive for anti-DSG3 antibodies on in-direct 
immunofluorescence. She had her treatment switched from azathioprine to 
mycophenolate and prednisolone, leading to resolution of her symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate real-world short-term outcomes among patients with 
systemic JIA starting tocilizumab or anakinra.
METHODS: This analysis included all systemic JIA patients within the UK 
Biologics for Children with Rheumatic Diseases study starting tocilizumab or 
anakinra between 2010 and 2016. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and 
one year. At one year the following outcomes were assessed: minimal disease 
activity, clinically inactive disease, 90% ACR Paediatric response (ACRPedi90). 
Univariable logistic regression was used to identify baseline characteristics 
associated with these outcomes. Multiple imputation was used to account for 
missing data.
RESULTS: Seventy-six systemic JIA patients were included (54 tocilizumab; 22 
anakinra). More patients starting anakinra as their first biologic compared with 
tocilizumab (86% vs 63%; P = 0.04), with shorter disease duration (1 vs 2 years; 
P = 0.003) and higher frequency of prior macrophage activation syndrome (37% vs 
8%; P = 0.004). Overall, at one year, 42% achieved ACRPedi90, 51% minimal 
disease activity, and 39% clinically inactive disease, with similar responses 
seen between the two drugs. Response was not associated with baseline disease 
characteristics. Fifteen (20%) patients stopped biologic treatment by one year. 
Treatment survival was better with tocilizumab (89% at one year vs 59% anakinra; 
P = 0.002), with three stopping for anakinra injection-related problems.
CONCLUSION: In this real-world cohort of patients with systemic JIA receiving 
tocilizumab or anakinra, approximately half achieved a minimal disease state by 
one year. Treatment responses appeared similar between the two therapies albeit 
with better persistence observed with tocilizumab.

OBJECTIVE: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for treatment of RA. We 
compared tofacitinib modified-release (MR) 11 mg once daily (QD) with 
tofacitinib immediate-release (IR) 5 mg twice daily (BID) in Japanese patients 
with RA and inadequate response to MTX.
METHODS: Phase III, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 12-week study. 
Patients were randomized to tofacitinib MR 11 mg QD (n = 104) or IR 5 mg BID (n 
= 105), with stable MTX. Compliance was based on returned pill counts. The 
primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of MR 11 mg QD to IR 5 mg 
BID. Non-inferiority was declared if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for 
the difference in change from baseline in DAS28-4(CRP) at week 12 was <0.6.
RESULTS: At week 12, with tofacitinib MR 11 mg QD and IR 5 mg BID, respectively, 
the change from baseline in least squares mean DAS28-4(CRP) was -2.43 and -2.85; 
the mean difference was 0.43 (95% CI 0.17, 0.69). Non-inferiority of MR 11 mg QD 
to IR 5 mg BID was not met. Improvement of DAS28-4(CRP) ⩾1.2 was observed in 89 
and 85% of patients, respectively, corresponding to a clinically important, 
significant change in both groups. The frequency of adverse events (52.9 and 
51.4%, respectively) and serious adverse events (4.8 and 3.8%, respectively) was 
generally similar between treatments. No deaths were reported.
CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority of MR 11 mg QD to IR 5 mg BID was not met in this 
study. However, clinically meaningful improvements in RA were observed with both 
tofacitinib formulations in Japanese patients. The safety profile was similar 
with both formulations.

Is joint pain in patients with arthralgia suspicious for progression to 
rheumatoid arthritis explained by subclinical inflammation? A cross-sectional 
MRI study.

Author information:

Netherlands.
(2)Department of Rheumatology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The 
Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: The development of RA includes a phase of arthralgia preceding 
clinical arthritis. The aetiology of symptoms of arthralgia is unclear. Since 
subclinical joint inflammation is expected to be causally related to pain, we 
aimed to study associations between subclinical MRI-detected inflammation and 
pain in patients with arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA.
METHODS: Unilateral MRIs of the wrist, MCP (2-5) and MTP (1-5) joints of 325 
patients who fulfilled the EULAR definition of arthralgia suspicious for 
progression to RA were scored by two readers on subclinical inflammation 
(synovitis, bone marrow oedema and tenosynovitis). Associations between 
MRI-detected inflammation and overall pain severity at patient level (measured 
using the visual analogue scale), as well as with local joint tenderness, were 
studied. Analyses were stratified for ACPA.
RESULTS: At patient level, synovitis (β = 0.10, P = 0.048) and tenosynovitis (β 
= 0.11, P = 0.026) associated with the visual analogue scale pain. Of the 1620 
imaged joints, 447 (28%) were tender. MRI-detected synovitis associated 
independently with joint tenderness in all patients (odds ratio 1.74, P < 
0.001), and in the ACPA-negative stratum (odds ratio 1.96, P < 0.001). In the 
ACPA-positive stratum only bone marrow oedema (osteitis) was independently 
associated with tenderness (odds ratio 2.39, P = 0.005). Sensitivity analyses in 
patients who developed inflammatory arthritis during follow-up (n = 61) revealed 
similar associations. Subclinical inflammation was present in 51% of tender 
joints and 39% of non-tender joints.
CONCLUSION: In patients with arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA, 
MRI-detected subclinical inflammation is associated with overall pain and local 
joint tenderness. However, the association is partial, indicating that 
subclinical inflammation is not the sole explanation of the arthralgia.

    J Travel Med. 2018 Jan 1;25(1):

INTRODUCTION: Typhoid fever is a global health problem, causing significant 
morbidity and mortality. Currently, the most widely used vaccine is the typhoid 
Vi capsular polysaccharide (Vi-PS) vaccine. While epidemiological studies on its 
efficacy have been performed in children in endemic countries, there are no 
efficacy studies evaluating its use in travel medicine. Response to vaccination 
may differ in travellers receiving immunosuppressive therapy. This study 
investigates the humoral response to Vi-PS vaccination in travellers receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid disease.
METHODS: We recruited patients from the LUMC rheumatology outpatient clinic and 
travellers from the travel clinic who had previously received Vi-PS vaccination 
and also immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid disease. We analysed blood 
samples acquired from 42 patients over a period of 3 years. We estimated the 
length of persistence of protective titres using the survival analysis using 
multiple cut-off values for protection and measured titre half-life and the 
influence of immunosuppressive medication on titre half-life using mixed models.
RESULTS: Anti-Vi-PS antibody levels stayed above 10 EU/ml for a mean of 13.3 
years, above 15 EU/ml for a mean of 10.1 years and above 20 EU/ml for a mean of 
8.6 years after Vi-PS vaccination. Titre half-life was 7.5 years (95% CI 
5.0-14.7 years, P < 0.001). No significant influence of medication on titre 
half-life was found.
CONCLUSION: Both persistence of protective antibody titres and titre half-life 
are longer than expected based on other studies. This warrants further study in 
adult volunteers, both in healthy individuals and patients suffering from 
rheumatoid disease.

BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a multifunctional cytokine 
that has numerous biological processes. Earlier research indicates that protein 
and mRNA production of TGF-β1 are enhanced in the renal tissues of patients with 
diabetic nephropathy (DN). Our aim was to evaluate the role of TGF-β1 in early 
prediction of DN in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
METHODS: Fifty patients with T1DM were enrolled in an observational study. 
Patients were eligible to participate if at least 3 years had passed since T1DM 
diagnosis. Patients were classified into two groups (A and B) according to the 
presence or absence of microalbuminuria, respectively. Serum TGF-β1 was measured 
by ELISA in the patients.
RESULTS: Out of the 50 studied patients with T1DM, there were 23 (46%) patients 
with microalbuminuria. There was a significant difference between patients in 
group A and B as regards TGF-β1 (p < 0.001). HbA1c had very little influence in 
controlling for the relationship between TGF-β1 and disease duration. Diagnostic 
cutoff value of TGF-β1 was 358.5 pg/ml with sensitivity and specificity of 100%.
CONCLUSION: TGF-β1 was significantly higher in children with DN in comparison 
with children without. It could be used as an early indicator of DN in children 
with T1DM with high sensitivity and specificity.

Anti-NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is one of 
the most common paraneoplastic encephalitides. It occurs in both sexes, across 
all age ranges, and may occur in the presence or absence of an associated tumor. 
Its pathogenesis and clinical presentation relate to the presence of IgG1 or 
IgG3 antibodies targeting the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, leading to a 
disinhibition of neuronal excitatory pathways. Initial clinical manifestations 
may be nonspecific, resembling a viral-like illness; however, with disease 
progression, symptoms can become quite severe, including prominent psychiatric 
features, cognitive problems, motor dysfunction, and autonomic instability. 
Anti-NMDAR encephalitis may even result in death in severe untreated cases. 
Diagnosis can be challenging, given that initial laboratory and radiographic 
results are typically nonspecific. The majority of patients respond to first or 
second-line treatments, although therapeutic options remain limited, usually 
consisting of tumor removal (if there is confirmation of an underlying 
malignancy) in conjunction with prompt initiation of immunosuppressive 
medications along with intravenous immunoglobulins and/or plasma exchange. 
Although the clinical presentation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis overlaps with 
several other more common neurological and psychiatric disorders, early 
diagnosis and treatment is essential for a positive prognosis. Here, we 
concisely review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical management of this 
disease.

PURPOSE: To review and summarize the clinical features, presentations, 
diagnostic modalities, and management of ophthalmic manifestations of 
eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly Churg-Strauss 
Syndrome).
METHODS: A systematic PubMed search of all English articles on EGPA with 
ophthalmic involvement was performed. Emphasis was placed on English-language 
articles, but any article with an abstract translated into English was also 
included. Only those cases that satisfied the American Rheumatology criteria 
(1990) for diagnosis were included. Data examined included epidemiology, 
pathogenesis, presentations, diagnostic modalities, and management.
RESULTS: There was a wide range in ophthalmic manifestations of EGPA. In order 
of most frequent presentation to least frequent, these include central retinal 
artery or vein occlusion, ischemic optic neuropathy, conjunctival nodules, 
orbital myositis, proptosis, dacryoadenitis, retinal vasculitis/infarcts/edema, 
cranial nerve palsy, and amaurosis. The 46 qualifying cases were divided into 
the categories of ischemic vasculitis versus idiopathic orbital inflammation due 
to prognostic significance. Ischemic vasculitis cases tended to be older 
patients (p = 0.03), unilateral (p = 0.006), require immunosuppressive therapy 
beyond steroids (p = 0.015), and were less likely to show improvement on therapy 
(p = 0.0003).
CONCLUSIONS: Prompt diagnosis of EGPA by the ophthalmologist can decrease 
patient morbidity and mortality. This requires knowledge of likely ophthalmic 
EGPA presentations, as well as recommended workups and treatment.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Besides a distinct spectrum of demyelinating syndromes, 
encephalitis was observed in patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 
antibodies (MOG-abs).
METHODS: The clinical records of 690 patients with idiopathic demyelinating 
diseases of the central nervous system seen in our center from June 2015 to 
December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. All underwent serum aquaporin 4 
antibody (AQP4-ab) and MOG-ab detection by cell-based assays as a routine 
diagnostic approach. Patients with MOG-abs or AQP4-abs who had ever experienced 
an encephalitis-like illness during the disease course were identified. Whether 
diagnoses of possible or definite autoimmune encephalitis could be reached with 
regard to these particular episodes of encephalitis was determined. The 
incidence and clinical features of encephalitis in anti-MOG disease are 
described in detail and compared with those in anti-AQP4 disease.
RESULTS: Amongst the 690 patients, 87 were MOG-ab-positive whilst 140 were 
AQP4-ab-positive. 20.7% (18/87) of the MOG-ab-positive patients had typical 
presentations of encephalitis. Unique cortical lesions (72.2%, 13/18) were 
observed; fever (55.6%), intracranial hypertension (41.2%) and cerebrospinal 
fluid pleocytosis (64.7%) were common during MOG-ab-associated encephalitis. 
Sixteen of the 18 patients fulfilled the criteria of definite autoimmune 
encephalitis (specific disease with MOG-ab) during encephalitis, and five 
patients overlapped with anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor encephalitis 
(NMDARE). Only 3.6% (5/140) of the AQP4-ab-positive patients had encephalitis, 
and none overlapped with NMDARE. The Expanded Disability Status Scale scores and 
the Cerebral Functional System Scores at last follow-up were lower in patients 
with MOG-ab-associated encephalitis than in those with AQP4-ab-associated 
encephalitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Encephalitis should be recognized as an important clinical 
component in anti-MOG diseases.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatments for progressive-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) 
are lacking. To improve the disease management for progressive-onset MS, the 
differences between relapse-onset MS and progressive-onset MS in 
patient-reported disability, progression and symptoms were examined.
METHODS: A total of 1985 participants of the Australian Multiple Sclerosis 
Longitudinal Study were included. Associations between onset type and outcomes 
were assessed with negative binomial regression.
RESULTS: The severity of 17 of the 19 outcomes was significantly higher for 
progressive-onset MS patients than relapse-onset MS patients, including 
perspectives from disability, progression over the last year, fatigue, sensory, 
walking difficulties, pain, balance, spasticity, sexual dysfunction, bladder, 
bowel, anxiety, depression and the European quality of life (EQ-5D) (P < 0.05; 
adjusted mean ratio ranged from 1.11 to 1.52). The differences between the two 
onset types were most pronounced early in the disease process and reduced with 
increasing MS duration, and the interaction was significant for disability, 
progression over the last year, walking difficulties, bladder problems, bowel 
problems and spasticity.
CONCLUSION: Participants with progressive-onset MS were significantly worse off 
on nearly all patient-reported outcomes than relapse-onset MS participants, and 
the differences were most pronounced early in the disease course, highlighting 
the importance of early intervention for those with progressive-onset MS.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of perceived 
cognitive impairment (PCI) and explore its associations with lifestyle and 
disease characteristics in a large international cohort of people with multiple 
sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional analysis. Participants rated their 
cognitive function over the preceding 4 weeks using four questions in a subscale 
within the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life questionnaire (MSQOL-54). These 
questions assessed perceived concentration, attention and memory by the patient 
and family/friends. Four definitions of PCI were derived, ranging from lowest to 
highest specificity. Associations with PCI were assessed by log-binomial 
regression.
RESULTS: The prevalence of PCI in our sample ranged from 41.0% (95% confidence 
interval, 39.0-43.0) using the least-specific definition to 11.6% (95% 
confidence interval, 10.3-12.9) using the most specific definition. A number of 
factors were associated with PCI, increasing in magnitude as the definition 
specificity increased, including positive associations for smoking and body mass 
index, whereas physical activity, dietary quality and use of vitamin D/omega-3 
supplements were inversely associated with PCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports associations between healthy lifestyle behaviours 
and PCI in people with MS. Although reverse causality is a potential explanation 
for our findings, previous studies have shown comparable associations with 
healthy lifestyle and MS onset and progression. Subject to external validation, 
these results suggest benefits realized from a healthy lifestyle in people with 
MS.

BACKGROUND: An engineered glove measuring finger motor performance previously 
showed ability to discriminate early-stage multiple sclerosis (MS) patients from 
healthy controls (HCs). Radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) classifies 
asymptomatic subjects with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities 
suggestive of multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: Seventeen asymptomatic subjects with RIS and 17 HCs were assessed. They 
performed finger-to-thumb opposition sequences at their maximal velocity, 
metronome-paced bimanual movements and conventional and diffusion tensor MRI.
RESULTS: Subjects with RIS showed lower (P = 0.005) maximal velocity and higher 
(P = 0.006) bimanual coordination impairment than HCs. In RIS, bimanual 
coordination correlated with T2-lesion volume, fractional anisotropy and radial 
diffusivity in the white matter.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings point out the relevance of fine hand measures as a 
robust marker of subclinical disability.

Exosome-encapsulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as potential 
biomarkers in autoimmune diseases. However, little is known about the role of 
exosome-delivered miRNAs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we 
investigated the profile of specific exosomal miRNAs by microarray analysis of 
serum exosomes from three patients with RA and three healthy 
controls. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the 
aberrantly expressed exosomal miRNAs. A total of 20 exosome-encapsulated miRNAs 
were identified to be differently expressed in the serum of patients with RA 
compared with controls. Interestingly, we found that exosome-encapsulated 
miR-6089 was significantly decreased after validation by qRT-PCR in serum 
exosomes from 76 patients with RA and 20 controls. Besides, miR-6089 could 
inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cell proliferation and activation of 
macrophage-like THP-1 cells. TLR4 was a direct target for miR-6089. MiR-6089 
regulated the generation of IL-6, IL-29, and TNF-α by targetedly controlling 
TLR4 signaling. In conclusion, exosome-encapsulated miR-6089 regulates 
LPS/TLR4-mediated inflammatory response, which may serve as a novel, promising 
biomarker in RA.

Insulin pumps are used by a steadily increasing number of patients with 
diabetes. Avoiding certain disadvantages of conventional pumps (ie, the insulin 
infusion set) might make pump therapy even more attractive. Patch pumps are 
usually attached by means of an adhesive layer to the skin and have several 
additional advantages (smaller, more discrete, easier to use, and cheaper than 
conventional insulin pumps). This review provides a general overview of patch 
pumps, the technologies used, basic clinical requirements, why a number of 
developments failed, which clinical studies are needed to provide sufficient 
evidence for their usage, which costs are associated, what the patient 
preferences are (which might differ between certain patient groups), and what is 
the future of patch pumps (ie, artificial pancreas systems).

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of 
vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia. Endothelial dysfunction has 
been well documented in other types of vasculitis but not in EGPA. Thirty 
patients (10 men and 20 women) diagnosed with EGPA and remaining in a remission, 
and 58 controls (24 men and 34 women) matched for age, sex, and body mass index, 
were enrolled in the study. We assessed each participants for typical risk 
factors of cardiovascular diseases and measured serum levels of vascular cell 
adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and thrombomodulin. We also 
measured flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and intima-media 
thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery using ultrasonography. Patients 
with EGPA had 20% higher serum level of VCAM-1 (p < 0.001) and 41.9% of 
thrombomodulin (p < 0.001). They also had 38.8% lower relative increase of FMD 
(FMD%) (p < 0.001), indicating endothelial dysfunction. These differences 
remained significant also after adjustment for potential confounders. Laboratory 
and ultrasonographic parameters of endothelial injury were correlated to the 
markers of inflammation and impaired kidney function. Determinants of lower FMD% 
in a simple regression model were pack-years of smoking (β = - 0.3 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) - 0.5 to - 0.1]), serum level of IL-6 (β = - 0.36 [95% 
CI - 0.62 to - 0.1]), and thrombomodulin (β = - 0.34 [95% CI - 0.6 to - 0.08]). 
EGPA patients are characterized by inflammatory endothelial injury that is 
likely related to the pathogenesis of the disease. Proper immunosuppressive 
treatment is the best method to prevent atherosclerosis and future 
cardiovascular events, the patients may also benefit from additional preventive 
interventions.

miRNAs are noncoding RNA that play a critical role as fine regulators of gene 
expression at the posttranscriptional level within cells in numerous autoimmune 
diseases. miR-221/222 play a role in cancer by regulating cell proliferation, 
invasion and apoptosis. However, there have been insufficient studies on their 
role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This work is designed to analyze the 
miR-221/222 expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 
patients with RA in comparison with healthy controls using quantitative RT-PCR, 
in a group of 30 RA patients and 20 healthy controls. The fold change of 
miR-221/222 expression in PBMCs was significantly elevated (p < 0.01) in RA 
patients compared with healthy controls. A positive correlation between 
expression levels of miR-221 and miR-222 was recorded (r = 0.303; p < 0.05). 
High miR-221/222 expression levels appeared to be elevated with high activity. 
miR-222 expression in high activity group of RA patients was significantly 
increased in relation to moderate (p < 0.01) and low (p < 0.001) activity ones 
with positive correlation (r = 0.363; p < 0.05) between the progress of disease 
activity and change in miR-222 expression level. ROC analysis showed a 
sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 75% for miR-221. In miR-222, the 
sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 70% were recorded. Our data shed some 
light on the role of miR-221/222 expression in RA patients, and their great 
potential value as new novel noninvasive biomarkers for disease detection. 
Therefore; further investigations are warranted to fully elucidate their role in 
rheumatoid.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease that 
affects approximately 2.5 million people globally. Even though the etiology of 
MS remains unknown, it is accepted that it involves a combination of genetic 
alterations and environmental factors. Here, after performing whole exome 
sequencing, we found a MS patient harboring a rare and homozygous single 
nucleotide variant (SNV; rs61745847) of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) 
galanin-receptor 2 (GALR2) that alters an important amino acid in the TM6 
molecular toggle switch region (W249L). Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging 
showed that the hypothalamus (an area rich in GALR2) of this patient exhibited 
an important volumetric reduction leading to an enlarged third ventricle. Ex 
vivo experiments with patient-derived blood cells (AKT phosphorylation), as well 
as studies in recombinant cell lines expressing the human GALR2 (calcium 
mobilization and NFAT mediated gene transcription), showed that galanin (GAL) 
was unable to stimulate cell signaling in cells expressing the variant GALR2 
allele. Live cell confocal microscopy showed that the GALR2 mutant receptor was 
primarily localized to intracellular endosomes. We conclude that the W249L SNV 
is likely to abrogate GAL-mediated signaling through GALR2 due to the 
spontaneous internalization of this receptor in this patient. Although this 
homozygous SNV was rare in our MS cohort (1:262 cases), our findings raise the 
potential importance of impaired neuroregenerative pathways in the pathogenesis 
of MS, warrant future studies into the relevance of the GAL/GALR2 axis in MS and 
further suggest the activation of GALR2 as a potential therapeutic route for 
this disease.

Among the inflammatory rheumatic diseases, SLE is associated with the highest 
risk of herpes zoster reactivation relative to age. The reported incidence of 
herpes zoster infection in SLE ranges from 6.4 to 91.4/1000 patient-years, with 
main risk factors being major organ disease, immunosuppressive and biological 
therapies. Although herpes zoster in SLE is manageable with anti-viral 
treatment, complications such as superimposed bacterial infection, post-herpetic 
neuralgia may ensue. The low rate of herpes zoster vaccination in SLE is related 
to the lack of awareness, fear of the risk of vaccine-induced infection and 
disease flare, cost, as well as the lack of explicit recommendations of vaccine 
use for the paucity of data in immunocompromised and younger subjects. The 
recent availability of the non-live subunit and inactivated herpes zoster 
vaccines has provided more opportunities for SLE patients to be protected 
against this viral infection. More clinical trials are clearly needed in SLE to 
confirm safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the herpes zoster vaccines.

OBJECTIVE: With the rising incidence of Type 1 diabetes (T1DM), it is important 
to recognize deficiencies in care and areas of improvement to provide better 
access to resources and education for T1DM patients. The objective of this study 
was to recognize social factors and compliance barriers affecting glycated 
hemoglobin (A1c) level in T1D patients among the minority population.
METHODS: A total of 84 T1DM patients, ages 3 to 21 years, 49% males, 87% African 
American participated in the study. Study questionnaires assessing patient 
knowledge and other variables were distributed and patient charts were reviewed 
retrospectively to obtain relevant clinical data. T-tests, one-way ANOVA and 
spearman correlation were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Mean A1c in our study was 10.5% and mean knowledge score was 10.1 out 
of 14. There was no significant correlation (r = 0.12, p = 0.26) between A1c and 
patients' knowledge scores. Patients with more frequent blood sugar (BS) 
monitoring (3-4 times/day) had 2 points lower A1c (9.6 vs 11.6 %, 95% CI 
0.2-3.7, p = 0.03) than those with 2 or less times/day. No significant 
difference in A1c between 3-4 checks/day vs >4 checks/day BS checks. Most 
patients reported 'forgetfulness' (19%) followed by 'too time consuming' (17.9%) 
as barriers to daily BS monitoring. There was no significant difference in A1c 
between pen or pump users (10.5 vs 10.2 %, p = 0.55). Surprisingly, those with 
home supervision had higher A1c than those without (10.7 vs 9.6 %, p = 0.04) 
while there was no significant difference between those with or without nurse 
supervision at school (10.6 vs 9.8 %, p = 0.33). Those reporting happy mood 
interestingly had higher A1c than those with sad/depressed mood (10.7 vs 9.4 %, 
p = 0.04). On multiple linear regression analysis, frequency of BS checks, home 
supervision and mood were the most significant predictors of A1c and altogether 
explained 20% of the variability in A1c.
CONCLUSION: Frequent BS monitoring is associated with lower A1c. Supervision at 
home and school did not improve A1c, but it was self-reported information. Mood 
did not affect A1c contrary to that reported in other studies.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus is prone to recurrent attacks, and its 
treatment is related to disease activities. It is important to accurately assess 
the patient's disease activity. So, the purpose of this study was to investigate 
the relation between neutrophil-to-C3 ratio (NC3 R), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR), and disease activity in patients with Systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE).
METHODS: This was a retrospective study. One hundred and ninety-four patients 
with SLE and 71 healthy controls were included in this study. We divided the 
patients into two groups according to the SLE disease activity (SLEDAI). Group 1 
included patients with a score of >9 (patients with severe disease activity), 
and Group 2 included patients with a score of 9 and lower (patients with mild 
disease activity). Correlations between NC3 R, NLR, and disease activity were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: NC3 R and NLR in patients with SLE were obviously higher compared to 
healthy controls (P < 0.05). There was an obviously significant difference in 
NC3 R and NLR between Group 1 and Group 2 (P < 0.05). SLEDAI scores were 
positively correlated with NC3 R (r = 0.353, P < 0.01) and NLR (r = 0.237, 
P = 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that 
the cutoff value of NC3 R to identify SLE with high disease activity was 5.935, 
with sensitivity and specificity being 75.9% and 67.0%, while that of NLR was 
2.293, with sensitivity being 68.9% and specificity being 82.8%.
CONCLUSION: NC3 R and NLR are two useful inflammatory markers for evaluating 
disease activity in patients with SLE.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene FokI (rs2228570) polymorphism was postulated to 
influence outcome of several inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the influence of rs2228570 polymorphism on lipid profile and on outcome 
in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with etanercept. A 
total of 153 subjects (62 JIA patients and 91 controls) were screened for the 
rs2228570 using the PCR-RFLP method. Lipid profile (cholesterol, 
triacylglycerol, HDL-C, and LDL-C) was determined using standard biochemical 
analysis in controls, while in JIA patients, it was determined prior to and 
12 months after anti-TNF (etanercept) therapy. Clinical outcome was assessed 
using the JIA-American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. There 
were significant differences in the distribution of genotypes (p = 0.024) and 
alleles (p = 0.006; OR = 2.222, 95% CI 1.136-4.348) of the rs2228570 between 
patients and controls. Etanercept treatment significantly increased HDL-C levels 
(p = 0.006) in JIA patients with FF genotype in comparison to baseline values. 
No significant differences were seen in JIA-ACR 30/50/70 responses at month 12 
between FF and Ff/ff genotype carriers. This is the first study to demonstrate 
the protective effect of the VDR FokI FF genotype on lipid profile in JIA 
patients treated with etanercept. However, this has to be confirmed in a larger 
cohort of patients.

A seven-months-old girl under treatment for pneumonia presented with generalized 
edema, decreased urinary output and was found to have hypertension, 
muco-cutaneous fungal infection and pulmonary hypertension. Investigations 
revealed that she had heavy proteinuria, hypertriglyceridemia, hypoalbuminemia 
and elevated levels of free T3 and T4 with suppression of TSH levels in the 
serum. A diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) in thyrotoxic phase was made 
on the basis of clinical presentation and presence of anti-TPO antibodies and 
reduced uptake in thyroid (technetium) scintigraphy. The child responded to 
carbimazole therapy and propranolol. The case is presented to remind 
pediatricians about the rare occurrence of auto-immune thyroiditis in infancy 
with rare complications such as nephrotic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension.

OBJECTIVE: Children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are at risk for 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis. This can lead to pain, limited mouth 
opening, facial asymmetry, and malocclusion. Our objective was to characterize 
patients with JIA and TMJ involvement in a single center.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of children with JIA evaluated at 
Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Inclusion criteria were confirmed JIA and jaw 
complaints. Medical records were reviewed to document demographics, JIA 
information, age at first TMJ complaint, and involvement of other joints. 
Descriptive statistics were computed.
RESULTS: Majority of patients were white (mean age 13 years; range 5-18 years) 
with polyarticular rheumatoid factor (RF) negative or oligoarticular persistent 
JIA. Some were antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive, RF positive, or human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positive. Patients had involvement of other joints 
(e.g., fingers, knees, wrists). Of those with TMJ symptoms, 6 (10%) had TMJ 
arthritis.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, 60 (10%) of patients were diagnosed with TMJ 
arthritis. In this population, patients who are female, white, RF negative, 
HLA-B27 negative, ANA negative, and polyarticular RF-negative subtype and have 
involvement of other joints have a higher likelihood of having TMJ symptoms. If 
a patient meets these criteria, careful evaluation of TMJs should take place.

CONTEXT: Cathepsin S (CTSS) activity is elevated in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) 
patient tears.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal expression of tear and tissue CTSS activity 
relative to other disease indicators in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice.
METHODS: CTSS activity was measured in tears and lacrimal glands (LG) from male 
1-6 month (M) NOD and 1 and 6 M BALB/c mice. Lymphocytic infiltration was 
quantified by histopathology, while disease-related proteins (Rab3D, CTSS, 
collagen 1) were quantified using q-PCR and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: In NOD LG, lymphocytic infiltration was noted by 2 M and established by 
3 M (p < 0.01). IFN-ɣ, TNF-α, and MHC II expression were increased by 2 M 
(p < 0.01). Tear CTSS activity was significantly elevated at 2 M (p < 0.001) to 
a maximum of 10.1-fold by 6 M (p < 0.001). CTSS activity in LG lysates was 
significantly elevated by 2 M (p < 0.001) to a maximum of 14-fold by 3 M 
(p < 0.001). CTSS and Rab3D immunofluorescence were significantly increased and 
decreased maximally in LG acini by 3 M and 2 M, respectively. Comparable changes 
were not detected between 1 and 6 M BALB/c mouse LG, although Collagen 1 was 
decreased by 6 M in LG of both strains.
CONCLUSION: Tear CTSS activity is elevated with other early disease indicators, 
suggesting potential as an early stage biomarker for SS.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common disease in pediatric 
rheumatism. There is no specific symptom or examination finding for JIA, and the 
diagnosis is made by exclusion and differentiation. Because non-pediatric 
rheumatologists are sometimes involved in medical care, 'proposal for JIA 
guidance on diagnosis and treatment for primary care pediatricians and 
non-pediatric rheumatologists' was first published in 2007. In these 10 years, a 
number of new findings on pathophysiology and treatment of JIA have been 
published; therefore, we propose this guidance of 2018th edition aiming at 
updating and standardization of JIA medical care in Japan. This edition included 
the management of uveitis, macrophage activation syndrome, infectious diseases 
before and during treatment. Moreover, details of biologics are also described. 
Although this guidance is tailored to adaptation of examinations and drugs, we 
do not purpose to limit the physicians' discretion in clinical practice. This 
guidance should be viewed as recommendations and be individualized according to 
the condition of the patient. We hope that medical care for JIA will advance and 
more patients will get benefit based on this guidance. Then, further revisions 
are needed due to changes in future conditions.

The goal of this investigation was to examine clinical translation of glucose 
responsiveness of MK-2640, which is a novel insulin saccharide conjugate that 
can bind the insulin receptor or mannose receptor C type 1 (MRC1), the latter 
dependent upon glucose concentration. In a rising dose study in 36 healthy 
adults under euglycemic clamp conditions, rising exposures revealed saturation 
of MK-2640 clearance, likely due to saturation of clearance by MRC1. Potency of 
MK-2640 was ~25-fold reduced relative to regular human insulin. In a randomized, 
2-period crossover trial in 16 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus to 
evaluate glucose-responsiveness of i.v. administered MK-2640, we were unable to 
demonstrate a glucose-dependent change in MK-2640 clearance, although a 
significant glucose-dependent augmentation of glucose infusion rate was 
observed. These pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data provide 
crucial insights into next steps for developing an insulin saccharide conjugate 
as a clinically effective glucose-responsive insulin analog.

This review focuses primarily on the beneficial effects for human health of 
exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). UVR stimulates anti-inflammatory and 
immunosuppressive pathways in skin that modulate psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, 
and vitiligo; suppresses cutaneous lesions of graft-versus-host disease; and 
regulates some infection and vaccination outcomes. While polymorphic light 
eruption and the cutaneous photosensitivity of systemic lupus erythematosus are 
triggered by UVR, polymorphic light eruption also frequently benefits from 
UVR-induced immunomodulation. For systemic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, 
type 1 diabetes, asthma, schizophrenia, autism, and cardiovascular disease, any 
positive consequences of UVR exposure are more speculative, but could occur 
through the actions of UVR-induced regulatory cells and mediators, including 
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, interleukin-10, and nitric oxide. Reduced UVR 
exposure is a risk factor for the development of several inflammatory, allergic, 
and autoimmune conditions, including diseases initiated in early life. This 
suggests that UVR-induced molecules can regulate cell maturation in developing 
organs.

A kidney biopsy is done to determine the etiology of the glomerulonephritis (GN) 
and the severity of the lesion, to identify whether other lesions, related to or 
not related to the GN, are present on the kidney biopsy and finally to ascertain 
the extent of chronicity of the GN. The etiology of GN is based on the 
classification of GN into five groups: immune complex-mediated GN, 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated GN, anti-glomerular 
basement membrane (GBM) GN, monoclonal immunoglobulin-mediated GN and C3 
glomerulopathy. Immune complex GN includes multiple specific diseases such as 
lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, infection-related GN and fibrillary GN. ANCA 
GN, anti-GBM GN and C3 glomerulopathy are specific diseases in themselves, while 
monoclonal Ig GN includes proliferative GN with monoclonal Ig deposits and 
monoclonal Ig deposition disease. Thus identification of the class of GN and 
within it the specific disease determines the etiology of GN. Ancillary studies 
may be required to confirm the etiology of GN. The severity of the GN is 
revealed by the pattern of injury, such as crescentic, necrotizing, diffuse 
proliferative, exudative, membranoproliferative, mesangial proliferative or a 
sclerosing GN. Secondary diagnosis either related or unrelated to the GN, such 
as diabetic glomerulosclerosis, acute tubular necrosis or thrombotic 
microangiopathy, may also be present. The secondary diagnosis may sometimes be 
the reason for the kidney biopsy. The chronicity of GN is determined by 
evaluating the extent of glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial 
fibrosis and vascular sclerosis present on the biopsy. This review summarizes 
the approach to standardizing a kidney biopsy report that includes these 
components in a logical and sequential manner.

OBJECTIVES: This randomized, controlled clinical trial aims to compare the 
efficacy and safety of glucocorticoid combined with MMF and glucocorticoid 
monotherapy for patients with IgG4-related disease.
METHODS: Sixty-nine patients newly diagnosed with IgG4-related disease were 
randomly divided into two groups (35 patients in Group I and 34 patients in 
Group II). Patients in Group I received glucocorticoid monotherapy (0.6-0.8 
mg/(kg·day) and tapered gradually); patients in Group II received glucocorticoid 
combined with MMF therapy (1-1.5 g/day). All the patients were followed up at 1, 
3, 6 and 12 months. The primary endpoint was response rate in 12 months and the 
secondary endpoints were relapse, remission rate and adverse reactions.
RESULTS: Group I and Group II shared almost the same efficacy at the 1 month 
treatment, but during the follow-up, the complete response rate in Group II was 
much higher than that in Group I at different time points, and the cumulative 
relapse rate during 1 year of therapy was much higher in Group I than that in 
Group II (40.00 vs 20.59%). The remission rate was lower in Group I (51.42 vs 
76.47%). Relapses were more likely to happen in lung, lacrimal gland, salivary 
gland, paranasal sinus and kidney. MMF could reduce relapse, especially organs 
recurrence. No serious adverse reactions occurred in the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Combination treatment with glucocorticoid and MMF was more effective 
than the monotherapy, and the relapse of IgG4-related disease might be 
associated with the elevated levels of serum IgG4 and the low glucocorticoid 
maintenance dose.

BACKGROUND: Recent discoveries from animal models demonstrated that neutrophils 
can induce type 1 diabetes (T1D) through infiltrating into the islets. However, 
the evidence of their actions in T1D patients is relatively rare, and the change 
trend of neutrophil numbers and functions in different subtypes of diabetes has 
not been investigated.
METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed T1D (n = 189), latent autoimmune diabetes 
in adults (LADA) (n = 86), T2D (n = 235), and healthy controls (n = 709) were 
enrolled. Circulating neutrophil counts were measured, and their correlations 
with clinical parameters were analysed. Neutrophils were isolated by density 
gradient centrifugation and magnetic bead cell sorting method. Neutrophil 
migration rate and chemokine levels in the blood were explored by trans-well and 
ELISA, respectively. Neutrophil phagocytosis rate, adhesion molecules and 
chemokine receptors expression were investigated by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, neutrophil counts decreased in T1D patients but 
increased in T2D patients, with no change in LADA patients. The numbers showed a 
gradual increase trend from T1D, LADA to T2D. In autoimmune diabetes, neutrophil 
counts were associated with the number and titre of positive autoantibodies 
against β-cell antigens. No difference was found in neutrophil phagocytosis 
rate, but neutrophil migration in T1D patients was impaired and associated with 
CD62L expression, which was related closely to the titre of autoantibody.
CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil numbers and migration abilities displayed distinct 
levels in different types of diabetes. In T1D, CD62L seems to play an important 
role in the migration of neutrophils and β-cell autoimmunity.

To estimate the mortality and describe the causes of death in a large 
multicenter cohort of hospitalized patients with SLE in China. This was a 
retrospective study of a nationwide SLE cohort (10 centers, 29,510 hospitalized 
patients) from 2005 to 2014 in China. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were 
calculated for all death and were stratified by sex and age. Chi-square test was 
used to determine whether the major causes of death vary in age, sex, duration 
of SLE, disease activity, or medications. Comparison between dead patients and 
survival controls was used to identify the risk factors for mortality. Logistic 
regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for mortality. A total 
of 360 patients died during the study period, accounting for 1.22%. The overall 
SMR was 2.13 (95% CI 1.96, 2.30), with a particularly high SMR seen in subgroups 
characterized by younger age. Infection (65.8%) was the most common cause of 
death, followed by lupus nephritis (48.6%), hematological abnormality (18.1%), 
neuropsychiatric lupus/NPSLE (15.8%), and interstitial pneumonia (13.1%). 
Cardiovascular disease and malignancy contributed little to the causes of death. 
Infection, in particular severe pulmonary infection, emerged as the foremost 
risk factor for mortality, followed by lupus encephalopathy. However, lupus 
nephritis and hematological abnormalities occurred more frequently in survival 
patients. SLE patients at a younger age of diagnosis have a poorer prognosis. 
Infection dominated the causes of death in recent China. Ethnicity and 
medications might account for the differences in causes of death compared with 
western populations.

Fingolimod is an approved therapeutic option for patients with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that primarily functions by sequestering 
T cells in lymph nodes inhibiting their egress to the central nervous system. 
However, recent data suggests that Fingolimod may also directly affect the 
immune cell function. Here we examined the in vivo effects of Fingolimod in 
modulating the phenotype and function of T cell and Foxp3 regulatory T cell 
populations in patients with multiple sclerosis under Fingolimod treatment. 
Besides decreasing the cell numbers in peripheral blood and sera levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, Fingolimod inhibited the expression of Th1 and Th17 
cytokines on CD4+ T cells and increased the expression of exhaustion markers. 
Furthermore, treatment increased the frequency of regulatory T cells in blood 
and inhibited the Th1-like phenotype that is characteristic of patients with 
multiple sclerosis, augmenting the expression of markers associated with 
increased suppressive function. Overall, our data suggest that Fingolimod 
performs other important immunomodulatory functions besides altering T cell 
migratory capacities, with consequences for other autoimmune pathologies 
characterized by excessive Th1/Th17 responses and Th1-like regulatory T cell 
effector phenotypes.

A primary initiating epitope in the NOD mouse model of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) 
lies between residues 9 and 23 of the insulin B chain. The B:9-23 peptide can 
bind to the NOD MHC class II molecule (I-Ag7) in multiple registers, but only 
one, (register 3, R3), creates complexes able to stimulate the majority of 
pathogenic B:9-23-specific CD4+ T cells. Previously we generated a monoclonal 
antibody (mAb287) that targets this critical I-Ag7-B:9-23(R3) complex. When 
given weekly to pre-diabetic mice at either early or late stages of disease, 
mAb287 was able to delay or prevent T1D in the treated animals. Although the 
precise mechanism of action of mAb287 remains unclear, we hypothesized that it 
may involve deletion of antigen presenting cells (APCs) bearing the pathogenic 
IAg7-B:9-23(R3) complexes, and that this process might be rendered more 
efficient by re-directing cytotoxic T cells using a mAb287 chimeric antigen 
receptor (287-CAR). As anticipated, 287-CAR T cells secreted IFN-γ in response 
to stimulation by I-Ag7-B:9-23(R3) complexes expressed on artificial APCs, but 
not I-Ag7 loaded with other peptides, and killed the presenting cells in vitro. 
A single infusion of 287-CAR CD8+ T cells to young (5 week old) NOD mice 
significantly delayed the onset of overt hyperglycemia compared to untreated 
animals (p = 0.022). None of the 287-CAR CD8+ T cell treated mice developed 
diabetes before 18 weeks of age, while 29% of control-CAR T cell treated mice 
(p = 0.044) and 52% of the un-treated mice (p = 0.0001) had developed T1D by 
this time. However, the protection provided by 287-CAR CD8+ T cells declined 
with time, and no significant difference in overall incidence by 30 weeks 
between the 3 groups was observed. Mechanistic studies indicated that the 
adoptively transferred 287-CAR T cells selectively homed to pancreatic lymph 
nodes, and in some animals could persist for at least 1-2 weeks post-transfer, 
but were essentially undetectable 10-15 weeks later. Our study demonstrates that 
CAR T cells specific for a pathogenic MHC class II:peptide complex can be 
effective in vivo, but that a single infusion of the current iteration can only 
delay, but not prevent, the development of T1D. Future studies should therefore 
be directed towards optimizing strategies designed to improve the longevity of 
the transferred cells.

BACKGROUND: A relationship between non-neurological autoimmune (NNAI) disorders 
and psychosis has been widely reported but not yet subjected to meta-analysis. 
We conducted the first meta-analysis examining the association between NNAI 
disorders and psychosis and investigated the effect of 1) temporality (as 
determined by study design), 2) psychiatric diagnosis, and 3) specific 
autoimmune disorders.
METHODS: Major databases were searched for articles published until April 2018; 
31 studies, comprising data for >25 million individuals, were eligible. Using 
random-effects models, we examined the overall association between all NNAI 
disorders and psychosis; rheumatoid arthritis was examined separately given the 
well-established negative association with psychosis. Stratified analyses 
investigated the effect of temporality, psychiatric diagnosis, and specific NNAI 
disorders.
RESULTS: We observed a positive overall association between NNAI disorders and 
psychosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.41) that 
was consistent across study designs and psychiatric diagnoses; however, 
considerable heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 88.08). Patterns varied across 
individual NNAI disorders; associations were positive for pernicious anemia 
(OR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.29-2.84), pemphigoid (OR = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.62-2.24), 
psoriasis (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.51-1.91), celiac disease (OR = 1.53; 95% CI, 
1.12-2.10), and Graves' disease (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03-1.72) and negative for 
ankylosing spondylitis (OR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.98) and rheumatoid arthritis 
(OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: While we observed a positive overall association between NNAI 
disorders and psychosis, this was not consistent across all NNAI disorders. 
Specific factors, including distinct inflammatory pathways, genetic influences, 
autoantibodies targeting brain proteins, and exposure to corticosteroid 
treatment, may therefore underlie this association.

Chronic fatigue, mood alterations and cognitive impairment are frequent 
accessory symptoms of HCV infection. Fatigue and mood alterations have also been 
observed in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), 
but not in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infection, thus indicating an autoimmune 
response as possible cause of HCV infection-associated encephalopathy. Data, 
however, are sparse. This study aimed to prove that HCV patients feature similar 
to those with autoimmune liver disease but contrary to HBV patients regarding 
neuropsychiatric symptoms. A total of 132 noncirrhotic patients (HCV: 46, HBV: 
22, AIH: 27, PBC: 29, AIH/PBC: 8) completed questionnaires addressing the 
domains mentioned above. Eighty-eight underwent a comprehensive 
neuropsychological assessment. Patient groups were compared among each other and 
to 33 healthy controls. Fatigue, anxiety and depression scores were 
significantly increased, and the SF-36 mental score significantly decreased in 
all patient groups compared to controls. Fatigue was significantly more 
pronounced in HCV than in HBV patients. HCV patients scored significantly worse 
than HBV patients but not AIH and PBC patients in the SF-36. HCV, AIH and PBC 
but not HBV patients did significantly worse than controls in word learning. 
Recognition of words was impaired in HCV, AIH and PBC patients and recognition 
of figures in HCV patients, exclusively (P ≤ 0.002). HCV patients did also worse 
than controls and HBV patients concerning alertness and working memory 
(P ≤ 0.001). The neuropsychiatric profiles of HCV patients are similar to those 
of AIH and PBC patients but differ from those of HBV patients, suggesting an 
autoimmune response as a possible cause for these differences.

BACKGROUND: Salivary gland dysfunction is one of the main clinical features of 
Sjögren's syndrome (SS), manifested by xerostomia with subsequent complications 
and well-established effects on the person's quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: To determine firstly whether selected tests of salivary gland 
function and structure, unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (UWSFR), parotid 
flow rate (PFR), clinical oral dryness score (CODS) and ultrasound score (USS), 
can discriminate SS from non-SS sicca patients and secondly whether these tests 
can differentiate between patients in different subgroups of SS.
METHOD: Unstimulated whole salivary flow rate, PFR, CODS and USS were determined 
in 244 patients comprised of SS patients (n = 118), SS patients at higher risk 
of lymphoma (n = 30) or with lymphoma (n = 26), and non-SS sicca disease 
controls (n = 70).
RESULTS: All assessments showed a significant difference between the overall SS 
group and the disease control group, attributed mainly to the lymphoma subgroups 
of SS (p < 0.0001 for all parameters). There was a significant correlation 
(Spearman r = 0.7, p value <0.0001) and 87.3% agreement between USS and the 
histology focus scores of 119 patients.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that salivary gland tests including USS can aid 
in differentiating between SS and non-SS dry mouth, especially the subgroups of 
SS with lymphoma or at higher risk of developing lymphoma.

Factors impacting on the action of glucocorticoids in patients receiving 
glucocorticoid therapy.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are steroid hormones, which are essential for life. They 
are secreted by the adrenal cortex under the control of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoids are essential for the 
normal function of most organ systems and, in both, excess and deficiency can 
lead to significant adverse consequences. Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a rare, 
life-threatening disorder characterized by insufficient production of 
corticosteroid hormones. Primary AI is defined by the inability of the adrenal 
cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or 
mineralocorticoids despite normal or increased adrenocorticotropin hormone 
(ACTH). Secondary AI is adrenal hypofunction due to insufficient amount of ACTH 
produced by the pituitary gland. Conventional treatment of both primary and 
secondary adrenal insufficiencies involves lifelong glucocorticoid replacement 
therapy. The role of cortisol deficiency and the impact of hydrocortisone 
replacement on morbidity and mortality in this patient group are under 
increasing scrutiny. Established glucocorticoid replacement regimens do not 
completely mirror endogenous hormonal production, and their monitoring to ensure 
optimum therapy is hampered by the lack of reliable biomarkers of hormone 
sufficiency. A further confounding issue is the tissue-specific regulation of 
glucocorticoid through the two isozymes of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
(11β-HSD) with research focusing on the role of this prereceptor regulation in 
the development of adverse metabolic features in patients. This review defines 
the factors influencing glucocorticoid action in patients with adrenal 
insufficiency receiving glucocorticoid therapy.

AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of diabetes education and access 
to healthcare coverage on disease management and outcomes in Latin America.
METHODS: Data were obtained from a sub-analysis of 2693 patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus recruited from 9 Latin American countries as part of the 
International Diabetes Mellitus Practices Study (IDMPS), a multinational, 
observational survey of diabetes treatment in developing regions.
RESULTS: Results from the Latin American cohort show that only 25% of 
participants met HbA1c target value (< 7% [53 mmol/mol]). Attainment of this 
target was significantly higher among participants who had received diabetes 
education than those who hadn't (28% vs. 19%, p < 0.001), and among those who 
practiced self-management (27% vs. 21% no self-management, p = 0.001). 
Multivariate analysis showed that participants who had received diabetes 
education were more likely to manage their diabetes (OR:1.65 [95% CI: 1.24, 
2.19]; p = 0.001), and to attain HbA1c target values (OR:1.48 [95% CI: 1.14, 
1.93]; p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Given the association between uncontrolled diabetes and long-term 
complications, health authorities and care providers should increase efforts to 
ensure widespread healthcare coverage and access to self-management education to 
reduce the socioeconomic and humanistic burden of type 1 diabetes.

Backgraund and Objective: Anti-Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Antibodies (ASCA) that 
are considered to reflect immune response against increased intestinal 
permeability due to mucosal damage are among the serological markers of Crohn's 
Disease.
METHODS: This microbial seromarker was recently shown to be elevated in several 
autoimmune disorders such as celiac disease, autoimmune liver diseases, type 1 
diabetes, and Graves' disease. Despite that fact, ASCA seropositivity in 
Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome (APS) has never been reported before.
RESULTS: Herein, we present a 46-year-old woman who has uveitis, autoimmune 
thyroiditis, and primary ovarian failure.
CONCLUSION: Based on the coexistence of these diseases, the patient was 
diagnosed with APS type III. Moreover, ASCA seropositivity was detected although 
she has no overt intestinal disease.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) have to face 
important decisions with regard to their medical treatment. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate whether a targeted cognitive training reduces framing 
effects and thus improves medical judgments.
METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study enrolling 
patients with relapsing-remitting MS and healthy controls (HCs). Participants 
were randomly assigned to training order A (first week, numerical training; 
second week, control training) or B (reverse order). The primary endpoint was 
changed in a framing task score (framing effect). In the framing task, 
participants evaluated the success of fictive medications on a 7-point scale. 
Medications were described in either positive or negative terms.
RESULTS: A total of 37 patients and 73 HCs performed either training order A (n 
= 56) or B (n = 54). The framing effect decreased after the numerical training 
regardless of training order. No such decrease was found after the control 
training. Mean change in framing effect was -0.3 ± 0.8 after the numerical 
training and 0.03 ± 0.6 after the control training. This specific effect of 
training type was comparable between groups.
CONCLUSION: Judgments of medical information improve in both patients with 
relapsing-remitting MS and HCs after a targeted numerical training. Thus, a 
specific cognitive intervention may help patients making informed decisions.

BACKGROUND: Microalbuminuria represents vascular and endothelial dysfunction. 
Thyroid hormones can influence urine albumin excretion as it exerts crucial 
effects on the kidney and on the vascular system. This study explores the 
relationship between serum thyrotropin and urine albumin excretion in euthyroid 
patients with diabetes.
METHODS: A total of 433 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes were included in this 
retrospective cross-sectional study. Data included anthropometric measurements 
and biochemical parameters from diabetes clinic. Males with urine albumin 
creatinine ratio >2.5 and female's >3.5 mg/mmoL were considered to have 
microalbuminuria.
RESULTS: 34.9% of the patients had microalbuminuria. Prevalence of 
microalbuminuria increased according to TSH quartiles (26.9, 34.6, 38.5 and 
44.9%, P for trend = 0.02). In a fully adjusted logistic regression model, 
higher TSH concentrations were associated with high prevalence of 
microalbuminuria (adjusted odds ratio 2.06 [95% CI: 1.14-3.72]; P = 0.02), while 
comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of TSH. Multiple linear 
regression analysis showed an independent association between serum TSH and 
urine albumin creatinine ratio (β = 0.007, t = 2.03 and P = 0.04). The risk of 
having microalbuminuria was higher with rise in TSH concentration in patients 
with younger age (<65 years), raised body mass index (≥25 kg/m2), hypertension, 
type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and age was the most important determinant ( 
P for interaction = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Serum TSH even in the euthyroid range was positively associated with 
microalbuminuria in euthyroid patients with diabetes independent of traditional 
risk factors. This relationship was strongest in patients with components of the 
metabolic syndrome.

The role of neutralizing antibodies in Zika-induced Guillain-Barré syndrome 
(GBS) has not yet been investigated. We conducted a case-control study using 
sera from the 2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia to determine the neutralizing 
antibody activity against Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2). 
We observed increased neutralizing antibody titers against DENV2 in 
ZIKV-infected individuals compared with uninfected controls and higher titers to 
both ZIKV and DENV2 in ZIKV-infected patients diagnosed with GBS compared with 
non-GBS ZIKV-infected controls. These data suggest that high neutralizing 
antibody titers to DENV and to ZIKV are associated with GBS during ZIKV 
infection.

Pathogens and autoimmune hepatitis.

Main, Germany.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a severe form of hepatitis resulting in the 
autoimmune-mediated destruction of the liver parenchyma. Whereas many of the 
immunopathogenic events have been elucidated and some of the drivers of the 
disease have been identified, little is known about the aetiology of the 
disease. There are certain risk factors, such as particular human leucocyte 
antigen (HLA) haplotypes, that enhance the susceptibility for AIH or influence 
the severity of the disease. However, as for many other autoimmune diseases, the 
mere presence of such risk factors does not warrant the occurrence of the 
disease. Not all individuals carrying risk factors develop AIH, and not all 
patients with AIH are carriers of high-risk alleles. Thus, additional 
environmental factors need to be considered as triggers for AIH. Environmental 
factors include diet, sunlight exposure, stress, medication and hygiene, as well 
as pathogen infections and vaccinations. This review discusses if pathogens 
should be considered as triggers for the initiation and/or propagation of AIH.

Autoimmunity and immune system dysregulation in schizophrenia: IgGs from sera of 
patients hydrolyze myelin basic protein.

Several different theories of schizophrenia (SCZ) were discussed; the causes of 
this disease are not yet clear. Using ELISA, it was shown that titers of 
autoantibodies against myelin basic protein (MBP) in SCZ patients are ~1.8-fold 
higher than in healthy individuals but 5.0-fold lower than in patients with 
multiple sclerosis. Several rigid criteria were checked to show that the 
MBP-hydrolyzing activity is an intrinsic property of SCZ IgGs. Approximately 82% 
electrophoretically homogeneous SCZ IgGs purified using several affinity 
sorbents including Sepharose with immobilized MBP hydrolyze specifically only 
MBP but not many other tested proteins. The average relative activity of IgGs 
from patients with negative symptoms was 2.5-fold higher than that of patients 
with positive symptoms of SCZ, and it increases with the duration of this 
pathology. It was shown that abzymes are the earliest statistically significant 
markers of many autoimmune pathologies. Our findings surmise that the immune 
systems of individual SCZ patients can generate a variety of anti-MBP abzymes 
with different catalytic properties, which can attack MBP of the 
myelin-proteolipid shell of axons. Therefore, autoimmune processes together with 
other mechanisms can play an important role in SCZ pathogenesis. MBP-hydrolyzing 
antibodies were previously detected in the blood of 80% to 90% of patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, 
some similar neuropsychiatric indicators of disease common to SLE, MS, and SCZ 
were described in the literature. Thus, the destruction of the myelin sheath and 
the production of MBP-hydrolyzing antibodies can be a common phenomenon for some 
different diseases.

AIMS: To: (a) explore the prevalence of the symptoms perceived by patients with 
childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus; (b) identify the symptom clusters 
occurring in patients with childhood-onset Systemic lupus erythematosus; and (c) 
examine the association of the burden of each symptom cluster with sleep quality 
and depression.
BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus is an inflammatory autoimmune disease 
that may result in patients' perception of various symptoms, with possible 
negative effects on their quality of life. Understanding the prevalence of 
symptoms perceived by childhood-onset Systemic lupus erythematosus patients and 
the disease's symptom clusters may be helpful in managing such burdensome 
symptoms.
DESIGN: A correlational study design was used for this study in 2016.
METHODS: Self-reported data from the Systemic lupus erythematosus symptom 
checklist were used to assess the symptoms perceived by patients. Symptom 
clusters were analysed using cluster analysis.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included in this study. The most prevalent 
and burdensome symptom perceived by patients was fatigue. Five clusters were 
derived, including symptoms related to pain and itching; bruises and stomach 
complaints; weight gain; body image and circulatory problems; and fatigue. A 
poor sleeper may perceive a greater symptom burden in all five of the symptom 
clusters, except for cluster #3, which refers to symptoms related to weight 
gain.
CONCLUSION: Five symptom clusters were identified. It is hoped that this study 
will give useful knowledge for understanding the symptom clusters for patients 
with Systemic lupus erythematosus and for improving nursing care quality.

A 40-year-old male was hospitalized with renal impairment and severe 
hypercalcemia. His concentration of serum IgG4 was high, but serum whole PTH, 
1-25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and PTHrP were not elevated. Computed tomography showed 
swelling of the bilateral lacrimal glands and systemic lymphadenopathy. The 
histological findings of lacrimal gland biopsy fulfilled the diagnostic criteria 
of IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4ROD). Bone scintigraphy showed increased 
ectopic uptake in the stomach, heart, lungs, and kidneys. He died on day 16 of 
admission, although the therapies for hypercalcemia were continued. Autopsy 
results showed an increase of osteoclasts in the bone marrow and metastatic 
calcification in multiple organs, and excluded from the differential diagnosis 
other disorders which present lymph-node swelling and hypercalcemia such as 
cancer, lymphoma, Castleman's disease, and sarcoidosis. He was given a diagnosis 
of IgG4ROD with osteolytic hypercalcemia.

Our objective was to investigate whether a dietary pattern derived using 
inflammatory biomarkers is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk. We 
prospectively followed 79,988 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1984-2014) 
and 93,572 women in the NHSII (1991-2013); incident RA was confirmed by medical 
records. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were completed at baseline and 
approximately every 4 years. Inflammatory dietary pattern was assessed from FFQ 
data using the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP), including 18 
anti-/pro-inflammatory food/beverage groups weighted by correlations with plasma 
inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis 
factor-α receptor 2). We investigated associations between EDIP and RA using Cox 
regression. We identified 1185 incident RA cases over 4,425,434 person-years. 
EDIP was not associated with overall RA risk (p trend = 0.21 across EDIP 
quartiles). Among women ≤ 55 years, increasing EDIP was associated with 
increased overall RA risk; HRs (95% CIs) across EDIP quartiles were 1.00 
(reference), 1.14 (0.86-1.51), 1.35 (1.03-1.77), and 1.38 (1.05-1.83; p for 
trend = 0.01). Adjusting for BMI attenuated this association. Increasing EDIP 
was associated with increased seropositive RA risk among women ≤ 55 years (p for 
trend = 0.04). There was no association between EDIP and RA among women 
> 55 years (EDIP-age interaction, p = 0.03). An inflammatory dietary pattern was 
associated with increased seropositive RA risk with onset ≤ 55 years old, and 
this association may be partially mediated through BMI.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: It has been shown that children previously enrolled in 
follow-up studies have better glycaemic control during the early period after 
diabetes diagnosis. The aim of this study was to analyse glycaemic control over 
a longer period, past the period of partial remission, after diagnosis in 
children followed before diagnosis in the Swedish Diabetes Prediction in Skåne 
(DiPiS) study compared with children of equal age not enrolled in pre-diabetes 
follow-up, receiving equivalent diabetes care.
METHODS: HbA1c from diagnosis and for the following 5 years, as well as 
differences in insulin dosage, BMI, pump use, partial remission according to 
insulin dose-adjusted HbA1c and baseline demographics were compared between 
children who were enrolled in follow-up and had received information on diabetes 
risk (n = 51) and children not enrolled in follow-up (n = 78).
RESULTS: The group followed before diagnosis had a higher proportion of 
first-degree relatives (FDRs) with diabetes (28% vs 5.6%; p = 0.001) and a 
higher proportion of participants with mothers born in Sweden (100% vs 89%; 
p = 0.02). No significant differences in total daily insulin dose, pump use or 
other baseline sociodemographic factors were detected between the groups. Median 
HbA1c at diagnosis and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after diabetes diagnosis was 
significantly lower in children followed before diagnosis (all p < 0.05), and 
was not related to FDR status.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Compared with controls not previously enrolled in 
follow-up, our study shows that children enrolled in longitudinal follow-up 
before the diagnosis of diabetes have better glycaemic control, measured by 
HbA1c, up to 5 years after diagnosis and during the initial period of partial 
remission. Improved glycaemic control in the initial years of living with type 1 
diabetes could affect long-term outcome and complications and might also improve 
study enrolment in future longitudinal studies.

OBJECTIVES: The Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire (MSK-HQ) is a recently 
developed Patient Reported Outcome Measure for use across patients with 
musculoskeletal conditions. This study provides a validation of the MSK-HQ 
examining construct validity and reliability in inflammatory arthritis.
METHODS: 287 adults with inflammatory arthritis completed the MSK-HQ and other 
Patient Reported Outcome Measures at baseline and after 3 months. Construct 
validity was assessed using item response theory methods. Concurrent validity 
was considered in relation to the HAQ and EuroQol-5D in all patients, as well as 
the RA Impact of Disease (RAID), PsA Impact of Disease scales, and AS Quality of 
Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) in disease subtypes.
RESULTS: The MSK-HQ was approximately normally distributed with no evidence of 
floor or ceiling effects. A unidimensional structure was confirmed. Two items 
were less weakly related to the latent musculoskeletal health variable, 
providing some evidence of multidimensionality. Reliability was high (α = 0.93). 
The total score correlated highly with the HAQ (r = -0.81) and EuroQol-5D index 
(r = 0.80) in all patients, RAID in RA patients (r = -0.88), PsA Impact of 
Disease in PsA patients (r = -0.88), and ASQoL in AS patients (r = -0.86). 
Test-retest reliability was high (rICC = 0.73).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the validity and reliability of the 
MSK-HQ in people with inflammatory arthritis. The major advantage of the MSK-HQ 
is that it is not disease specific and has high content validity in 
rheumatological conditions. The MSK-HQ score will be of value in clinical 
rheumatology practice, providing a measure that can be used across disease 
areas.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate discriminative ability and clinical utility of the 
Timed Up and Go under single- and dual-task conditions between fallers and 
non-fallers in multiple sclerosis (MS).
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Neurology service in a tertiary hospital.
SUBJECTS: Participants were 101 people with MS and Expanded Disability Status 
Scale score of 3-6.5. One participant withdrew after the baseline assessment, 
and hence the data were analysed for 100 participants.
INTERVENTIONS: No specific intervention.
MAIN MEASURES: Timed Up and Go and Timed Up and Go-Cognitive. Three-month 
prospective diaries recorded falls.
RESULTS: Mean age was 52.6 (SD 10.7) and 66 were female. Majority of the 
participants had progressive MS (72) and 73 used a walking aid; 56 participants 
recorded 791 falls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
values for Timed Up and Go and Timed Up and Go-Cognitive in distinguishing 
fallers (person with ⩾1 fall) from non-fallers are 0.60 and 0.57, respectively, 
and in distinguishing multiple fallers (⩾2 falls) the values are 0.46 and 0.43. 
A Timed Up and Go score of ⩾9 seconds has a sensitivity of 0.82 and a 
specificity of 0.34 to identify fallers and a sensitivity of 0.79 and a 
specificity of 0.27 to identify multiple fallers. A Timed Up and Go-Cognitive 
score of ⩾11 seconds has a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.30 to 
identify fallers and a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.26 to identify 
multiple fallers.
CONCLUSION: The Timed Up and Go and Timed Up and Go-Cognitive do not demonstrate 
sufficient clinical utility or discriminative ability for assessing falls risk 
in MS.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease that 
classically presents as a symmetric pruritic vesicular eruption on extensor 
surfaces. Typical locations include elbows, knees, and buttocks. Facial 
involvement has been reported rarely. Here, we report a case of a 44-year-old 
woman with dermatitis herpetiformis presenting as pruritic vesicles on the face 
that had previously been misdiagnosed as allergic contact dermatitis. Diagnosis 
was confirmed with direct immunofluorescence demonstrating granular IgA in the 
papillary dermis. This eruption cleared with topical dapsone 5% gel and a 
gluten-free diet. We report this case to raise awareness of facial involvement 
in dermatitis herpetiformis as well as the possibility of topical dapsone as a 
therapeutic option.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are more frequent in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) patients when compared to controls. In particular, CVDs are 
linked with higher accumulation of lesions and advanced brain atrophy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CVDs contribute to accelerated lesion 
accumulation and brain atrophy over 5 years in patients with MS.
METHODS: 194 MS patients and 43 controls without neurologic disease were 
followed for 5 years. Full physical, neurological evaluation, and structured 
questionnaire investigating CVD and risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
heart disease, smoking, diabetes, obesity/overweight) were collected using 
interview-based questionnaire and further cross-reference with electronic 
medical records. Lesion and brain atrophy outcomes were assessed with 3T MRI. 
ANCOVA adjusted for age, gender, and disease duration were used accordingly. 
False discovery rate correction was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg 
correction.
RESULTS: Patients with diagnosis of heart disease showed higher white matter and 
whole brain volume loss compared to those without (-4.2% vs. -0.7%, P = 0.01 and 
-3.4% vs. -1.6%, P = 0.01, respectively). The percentage lateral ventricle 
volume change in MS patients with hypertension was higher compared to 
non-hypertensive patients (24.5% vs. 14.1%, P = 0.05). Hyperlipidemia, smoking, 
and obesity/overweight were not associated with progression of MRI-derived 
outcomes. CVDs did not contribute to larger lesion volume accrual over the 
5-year period. The presence of CVDs was not associated with MRI-derived changes 
in the controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension and heart disease contribute to advanced brain atrophy 
in MS patients. CVDs did not contribute to additional lesion accrual. CVD 
comorbidities in MS patients may contribute to neurodegenerative tissue injury 
that can be detected with brain MRI.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular pathology is increasingly acknowledged as a 
risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). Vascular density (VD) is reduced in the 
eyes of patients with MS on optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. We 
performed a 1-year prospective study to estimate VD variations over time and 
possible clinical correlates.
METHODS: A total of 50 patients with MS underwent spectral domain-OCT and OCT 
angiography at baseline and after 1-year follow-up. Mixed-effect linear 
regression models were used to assess variations of each OCT measure and its 
relation to treatment and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We observed an increase in parafovea VD (coefficient, 1.147; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.081-2.214; P = 0.035). Reduction in parafovea VD was 
associated with increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale score (coefficient, 
-0.969; 95% confidence interval, -1.732/-0.207; P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Retinal VD can improve over time in MS, particularly in patients 
experiencing disease stability. Longer follow-up, inclusion of early MS cases 
and combination with conventional markers of MS severity (i.e. brain atrophy) 
are needed to better define VD as a potential new biomarker.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and radiographic status, and to identify 
baseline predictors of functional status and erosive progression at 11 years' 
follow-up of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in the Danish investigator-initiated randomized 
controlled CIMESTRA trial, which investigated a 2 year treat-to-target 
intervention with methotrexate and intra-articular glucocorticoids with or 
without cyclosporine, were followed up. The 28-joint Disease Activity Score 
(DAS28), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, and total Sharp van der 
Heijde score (TSS) were assessed at baseline and 11 years. Baseline magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of unilateral wrists was scored (OMERACT RAMRIS). 
Multivariable linear regression analyses of baseline variables [TSS, HAQ, DAS28, 
age, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) status, gender, MRI erosion 
score, MRI synovitis score, MRI bone marrow oedema score] were performed in 96 
patients with HAQ11yrs and ∆TSS0-11yrs as dependent variables. Since outcomes 
were similar in the two treatment arms, data were pooled.
RESULTS: In total, 120 of 160 patients completed 11 years' follow-up. They were 
63 (55-72) years old, 68% were in DAS28 remission (≤ 2.4), HAQ11yrs was 0.25 
(0-0.75), mean ∆TSS0-11yrs was 0.96 ± 1.52 units/year; 53%, 20%, and 27% 
received conventional treatment, biologics, and no treatment, respectively; and 
34% had not progressed radiographically since baseline. Increased DAS28 
(p = 0.02) and anti-CCP (p = 0.03) predicted HAQ11yrs, whereas anti-CCP 
(p = 0.03) and MRI bone marrow oedema (p = 0.01) predicted ∆TSS0-11yrs in 
multivariable analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Early and strict synovitis suppression with methotrexate and 
intra-articular glucocorticoids led to persistently high remission rates and 
limited erosive progression at 11 years. In this well-treated cohort, baseline 
anti-CCP status, DAS28, and MRI bone marrow oedema predicted functional status 
and/or erosive progression.

Determine disease activity in a low income juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
cohort. 164 JIA patients from families with less than US$ 4500.00/capita mean 
annual income followed in Fortaleza-CE, Brazil, were cross-sectionally evaluated 
between May 2015-April 2016. Mean age was 14 ± 5.1 years (95 female) with 
10.31 ± 3.7 years disease duration. Polyarticular category predominated, with 63 
(38.4%) patients, followed by 40 (24%) enthesitis-related (ERA), and 36 (22%) 
oligoarticular. All but 1 out of 84 parents declared less than US$ 10,000.00 
annual family income. Eighty-eight (60.7%) were receiving methotrexate and 19 
(13%) leflunomide including 12 (63%) using both; 46 (28%) were on biologic DMARD 
including 20 (43.5%) adalimumab, 17 (41.5) etanercept, 5 (10.8%) tocilizumab, 2 
(4.2%) abatacept, and 1 (2.1%) each on infliximab and canakinumab. Mean CHAQ and 
JADAS27 were 0.36 ± 0.55 and 5.31 ± 8.5, respectively. Thirty-two (20%) out of 
159 patients had deformities. A bivariate analysis revealed that polyarticular 
had more deformities than oligoarticular patients (p = 0.002; OR = 2.389; 95% CI 
1.37-4.14). Logistic regression showed no association between high JADAS and 
family income (p = 0.339; OR = 1.45; 95% CI 0.67-3.31). A general linear model 
showed significantly lower CHAQ score in patients from families earning more as 
compared to those earning less than 300.00 US$ monthly (p = 0.002). This study 
reports JIA disease activity in a low income population. Low income apparently 
did not influence prognosis given the low mean JADAS27 and CHAQ scores vis-à-vis 
data from other cohorts.

OBJECTIVE: To test the current progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
diagnostic criteria by applying them to patients previously diagnosed with 
natalizumab (NTZ)-associated PML in a real-world clinical setting.
METHODS: Patients from the Dutch-Belgian NTZ-PML cohort (n=28) were reviewed at 
the time of first diagnostic work-up and during follow-up, using the PML 
diagnostic criteria as proposed in a consensus statement from the American 
Academy of Neurology.
RESULTS: At first diagnostic work-up, 18 patients (64.3%) met the criteria for 
high diagnostic certainty for PML ('definite PML' or 'probable PML'). During 
follow-up, this increased to 20 patients (71.4%) as JC virus DNA was detected in 
cerebrospinal fluid of two additional patients. Nonetheless, 28.6% of patients 
were still classified as 'possible PML' or 'not PML' (6 (21.5%) and 
2 (7.1%) patients, respectively) despite a very high suspicion for PML based on 
lesion evolution and signs of PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome on 
MRI, and development of compatible symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The current case definition of PML has low sensitivity for 
diagnosis of NTZ-PML in a real-world clinical setting in which MRI is frequently 
used for PML screening. This may delay diagnosis and appropriate management of 
PML, and may complicate a valid estimation of PML incidence during NTZ therapy.

The international classification criteria for definite antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS) include three laboratory measurements: lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgG and 
IgM isotypes of anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β2glycoprotein I antibodies 
(anti-β2GPI). When persistently elevated, they are specific for APS; however, 
many patients that fulfil clinical criteria may exhibit negative serological 
results. These "seronegative" APS (SN-APS) are exposed to an increased 
thrombotic risk. The aims of our cross-sectional, retrospective study of 
consecutive autoimmune patients' samples were to evaluate the association of 
non-criteria antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) with thrombosis and obstetric 
events, to calculate the risk score for adverse events and to assess the 
specific contribution of single aPL positivity in SN-APS. LA, aCL, anti-β2GPI 
and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies (aPS/PT) of IgG, IgM, and IgA 
isotypes were determined in sera of 323 patients with autoimmune disorders. 
Medical records of all patients were carefully analyzed. aCL, anti-β2GPI and 
aPS/PT of IgG and IgA isotypes were significantly associated with thrombosis 
while none of the IgM aPL showed such association. aPS/PT of all isotypes, aCL 
and anti-β2GPI of IgG and IgA isotype showed significant correlation to 
obstetric events. When considering results of aPS/PT ELISA, we could 
additionally identify 3% of thrombotic patients and 2% of obstetric patients. 
Thrombotic and obstetric risk scores were calculated showing significantly 
higher association to clinical events, as compared to evaluating individual risk 
factors. aPS/PT could represent an additional biomarker in SN-APS patients. IgA 
aPL are associated with thrombosis and obstetric complications. Risk scores 
accounting different aPL and conventional risk factors, better assesses risk for 
adverse event, as compared to evaluating individual factors alone.

Leptomeningitis is a rare central nervous system manifestation of rheumatoid 
arthritis, generally in patients with established chronic rheumatoid disease. We 
report a 41-year-old man without previous rheumatoid arthritis or psychiatric 
disorder who presented with an acute neuropsychiatric disturbance and 
polyarthralgia. His MR scan of brain showed asymmetric bifrontal 
leptomeningitis, confirmed on (18F)-fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission 
tomography. Other investigations showed highly positive serum and cerebrospinal 
fluid anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide. A leptomeningeal biopsy showed 
necrotising leptomeningeal inflammation with ill-defined granulomas and 
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate without organisms. Prolonged high-dose 
corticosteroids and then rituximab resulted in recovery. Chronic leptomeningitis 
can present with an acute neuropsychiatric disorder. We highlight that early 
rheumatoid disease can, rarely, cause a chronic leptomeningitis, reversible with 
immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) 
associated vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis with insufficient 
epidemiologic estimates in the United States. We aimed to determine demographic 
and clinical features of ANCA associated vasculitis patients presenting to a 
large tertiary care referral center in Upstate New York. Design, setting, 
participants, and measurements: A retrospective analysis of cases with 
pauci-immune GN on renal biopsy and clinical diagnosis of ANCA vasculitis 
presenting over 11 years was conducted. Outcomes of interest were: demographics, 
ANCA antibody positivity, patient and renal survival, and regional trends.
RESULTS: 986 biopsies were reviewed, 41 cases met the criteria for inclusion: 18 
GPA, 19 MPA, and 4 double positive (anti-GBM disease plus ANCA vasculitis). Mean 
age at presentation was 52.4 years (SD 23.7), 23 (56%) were male and median 
creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL. The median patient follow up was 77 weeks (IQR 10 - 
263 weeks), with a 3-month mortality rate of 5.7% and a 1-year estimated 
mortality rate of 12%. Thirteen patients required hemodialysis at the time of 
diagnosis; 7 patients came off dialysis, with median time to renal recovery of 
4.86 weeks (IQR 1.57 - 23.85 weeks). C-ANCA positivity (p < 0.001) and C-ANCA 
plus PR3 antibody pairing (p = 0.005) was statistically significant in GPA 
versus MPA. P-ANCA positivity was observed in MPA versus GPA (p = 0.02) and 
double positive versus GPA (p = 0.002), with P-ANCA and MPO antibody pairing in 
MPA versus GPA (p = 0.044). Thirty-seven of the 41 cases were referred locally, 
16 cases were from within a 15-mile radius of Albany, Schenectady, and Saratoga 
counties.
CONCLUSIONS: ANCA vasculitis is associated with end stage renal disease and 
increased mortality. Our study suggests the possibility of higher regional 
incidence of pauci-immune GN in Upstate New York. Further studies should 
investigate the causes of clustering of cases to specific regions.

INTRODUÇÃO E OBJETIVOS: A vasculite associada a anticorpos anticitoplasma de 
neutrófilo (ANCA) é uma vasculite de pequenos vasos com estimativas 
epidemiológicas insuficientes nos Estados Unidos. Nosso objetivo foi determinar 
características demográficas e clínicas de pacientes com vasculite associada à 
ANCA, apresentando-se a um grande centro de referência de atendimento terciário 
em Upstate New York. Formato, cenário, participantes e medidas: Foi realizada 
uma análise retrospectiva dos casos de GN pauci-imune em biópsias renais e 
diagnóstico clínico de vasculite ANCA por mais de 11 anos. Os resultados de 
interesse foram: dados demográficos, positividade de anticorpos ANCA, sobrevidas 
renal e de pacientes e tendências regionais.
RESULTADOS: 986 biópsias foram revisadas, 41 casos preencheram os critérios de 
inclusão: 18 GPA, 19 PAM, e 4 duplo-positivos (doença anti-MBG com vasculite 
ANCA). A média de idade na apresentação foi de 52,4 anos (DP 23,7), 23 (56%) 
eram do sexo masculino e mediana de creatinina de 2,6 mg/dL. O acompanhamento 
mediano dos pacientes foi de 77 semanas (IQR 10 - 263 semanas), com uma taxa de 
mortalidade de 3 meses de 5,7% e uma taxa de mortalidade estimada em 1 ano de 
12%. Treze pacientes necessitaram de hemodiálise no momento do diagnóstico; 7 
pacientes saíram da diálise, com tempo médio para recuperação renal de 4,86 
semanas (IQR 1,57 - 23,85 semanas). A positividade para C-ANCA (p < 0,001) e o 
pareamento de anticorpos C-ANCA mais PR3 (p = 0,005) foram estatisticamente 
significantes em GPA versus PAM. A positividade de P-ANCA foi observada em PAM 
versus GPA (p = 0,02) e duplo positivo versus GPA (p = 0,002), com pareamento de 
anticorpos P-ANCA e MPO em PAM versus GPA (p = 0,044). Trinta e sete dos 41 
casos foram encaminhados localmente, 16 casos foram de dentro de um raio de 15 
milhas dos condados de Albany, Schenectady e Saratoga.
CONCLUSÕES: A vasculite por ANCA está associada à doença renal terminal e 
aumento da mortalidade. Nosso estudo sugere a possibilidade de maior incidência 
regional de GN pauci-imune no norte do estado de Nova York. Novos estudos devem 
investigar as causas do acúmulo de casos em regiões específicas.

Tubulointerstitial inflammation (TI) has prognostic significance in the renal 
outcomes of lupus nephritis. Here, we aimed to determine whether non-albumin 
proteinuria is associated with TI severity and with the renal response in lupus 
nephritis. We included patients with biopsy-confirmed lupus nephritis at a 
tertiary medical center in Korea from January 2011 to April 2017. Patients in 
whom the urine protein/creatinine ratio (uPCR) and the urine albumin/creatinine 
ratio (uACR) were measured simultaneously were included. Laboratory data and 
renal pathology were reviewed. Non-albumin proteinuria was calculated by 
subtracting uACR from uPCR. The renal response was assessed by the amount of 
proteinuria present at 6 months after treatment with immunosuppressants. 
Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with 
TI severity and renal response. Out of 45 patients, 36 (80%) had no-to-mild TI, 
whereas 9 (20%) had moderate-to-severe TI. Proliferative (class III ± V/IV ± V) 
and nonproliferative (class II/V) glomerulonephritis (GN) were present in 38 
(84.4%) and 7 (15.6%) patients, respectively. In the logistic regression 
analyses, non-albumin proteinuria (uPCR - uACR) was associated with 
moderate-to-severe TI (odds ratio [OR] 3.166, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 
1.145-8.757, p = 0.026) and was inversely associated with complete renal 
response (adjusted OR 0.180, 95% CI 0.045-0.718, p = 0.015). In lupus nephritis, 
non-albumin proteinuria was associated with TI severity and with poor renal 
response after immunosuppressive treatment. Thus, the determination of 
non-albumin proteinuria can provide clinically valuable information on lupus 
nephritis.

BACKGROUND: Although multiple sclerosis (MS) is often diagnosed during young 
adulthood (18-30 years), there is a lack of knowledge on the psychological 
adjustment to the illness among recently diagnosed young adult patients.
OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The aims of the study were to describe the adjustment to 
MS (depression, positive and negative affect) in a group of young adult patients 
and to investigate the role of identity satisfaction and self-efficacy in MS on 
adjustment. We hypothesized that the relationship between identity satisfaction 
and adjustment was mediated by self-efficacy (goal setting and symptom 
management).
METHODS: The cross-sectional study involved 66 patients (63.6% women) with a 
mean age of 25.2 years (SD = 3.4) who had been diagnosed for no more than three 
years. Patients completed measures of identity satisfaction (Identity Motives 
Scale), Self-efficacy in MS (SEMS), Depression (CESD-10), Positive and Negative 
Affect (PANAS). Data were analyzed through factorial ANOVAs and hierarchical 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent of patients reported depressive symptoms and 
negative affect mean score was higher than in the general population. Higher 
identity satisfaction was directly related to lower depression. Self-efficacy in 
goal setting partially mediated the relationship between identity satisfaction 
and positive affect, whereas self-efficacy in symptom management totally 
mediated the effect of identity satisfaction on negative affect. All results 
were significant at p < 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the usefulness of addressing identity 
redefinition and self-efficacy in psychological interventions aimed at promoting 
young adults' adjustment to MS in an early phase of the illness.

A 60-year-old man with a history of Raynaud's phenomenon presented with 
bilateral intermittent claudication and an ulcer on his right toe. The 
ankle-brachial index of the right and left legs was 0.77 and 0.75, respectively. 
Laboratory data showed prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time 
and a positive result on the lupus anticoagulant test. Computed tomography 
angiography revealed isolated infrarenal aortic stenosis with irregular surface 
and noncalcified plaques. Intravascular ultrasonography examination demonstrated 
a noncalcified, irregular, and mobile plaque, suggestive of abdominal aortic 
thrombosis. In addition to anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy, 
endovascular treatment was performed. A total of three 40-mm-long 
balloon-expandable stents were successfully implanted on a 15-mm balloon. The 
final angiography showed good results except for minimal plaque shifting in the 
terminal aorta. Three months later, the ulcer resolved and a final diagnosis of 
primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was made. Clinicians should recognize 
that APS can affect the abdominal aorta, leading to aortic thrombosis. 
Endovascular treatment may be the one good treatment option for this rare 
condition.

BACKGROUND: The risk factors for rapid growth and early metastasis of papillary 
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and the role of coexisting Graves' disease in the 
clinical course of PTC remain uncertain in children.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on a Japanese girl, whose PTC rapidly grew and 
metastasized within 4 years. Graves' disease was diagnosed by the presence of 
serum TSH receptor antibodies at 8 years of age when thyroid ultrasonography 
detected no nodules. After 4 years of effective treatment with thiamazole, 
multifocal nodules - up to 47 mm in diameter - were detected on thyroid 
ultrasonography. Chest CT scan revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the lung. 
After total thyroidectomy, PTC was pathologically diagnosed. The patient 
underwent two courses of radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, but the pulmonary 
metastatic lesions did not take up the RAI. Molecular analyses of the PTC tissue 
identified a TFG/NTRK1 chimeric gene and disclosed the preserved expression of 
TSHR and the reduced expression of SLC5A5 compared with non-tumor thyroid 
tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid growth and early metastasis of PTC with coexisting Graves' 
disease in this patient can be related to a combination of multiple factors 
including preserved TSHR expression, reduced SLC5A5 expression, and TFG/NTRK1 
rearrangement.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the key prognostic tool in people with a 
clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). There is increasing interest in treating 
people following a CIS in the hope that conversion to multiple sclerosis (MS) 
will be prevented and future disability reduced. So far, the prognostic value of 
MRI for disability following a CIS has not been evaluated systematically. We 
systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE. Cohort studies were selected if they 
reported associations of MRI and disability following a CIS, included at least 
50 people with a CIS at baseline, had at least 5 years of follow-up and obtained 
at least one structural MRI measurement (T1 lesions, T2 lesions, T1 
contrast-enhancing lesions or brain atrophy). We assessed the studies for 
quality and rated the completeness of MRI reporting. In total, 13 studies were 
identified reporting on the following: T2 lesion number and volume, T2 
infratentorial lesion number and volume, T1 contrast-enhancing lesions and grey 
matter fraction. T2 brain lesion number determined soon after the occurrence of 
a CIS was associated with disability progression after 5-7 years, with an 
increased risk when 10 or more lesions were present. Infratentorial lesions were 
also associated with a higher risk of subsequent disability. The number and 
distribution of MRI-visible lesions soon after a CIS are associated with 
disability later on, and may offer additional useful information when making 
treatment decisions in people with early MS. Further work is required to 
determine whether other measures have a higher predictive potential.

The basement membrane zone (BMZ) is framed by hemidesmosomes and extracellular 
matrix (ECM) including collagen IV (COL4). Hemidesmosomes are multiprotein 
complexes that include collagen XVII (COL17). BMZ proteins can be targeted in 
autoimmune subepidermal blistering diseases, e.g., pemphigoid targeting COL17. 
The blistering mechanisms in pemphigoid have not been fully elucidated, 
especially in mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), which mainly affects the mucosa. 
In this study, we showed that oral lesions in pemphigoid may be attributed to 
the inhibition of protein-protein interactions by autoantibodies. Using 
immunoprecipitation, we revealed that COL17 directly binds to COL4 in normal 
human keratinocytes and normal human oral keratinocytes. In particular, the 
C-terminus of COL17 is binding site to COL4 in oral keratinocytes. The precise 
COL4-binding region on COL17 was determined by protein-protein binding assay to 
be from amino acid Gly1175 to Asp1340 on the C-terminus. MMP-IgG or mAb 
recognizing the C-terminus hindered the interaction of COL17 with COL4 in oral 
keratinocytes. Furthermore, keratinocyte adhesion strength to COL4-coated plates 
was significantly reduced by the treatment of mAb against the C-terminus. In 
addition, the inflammatory infiltrates around perilesions were significantly 
less in MMP compared to BP. These results indicate that pemphigoid IgG targeting 
the C-terminus plays a pathogenic role in blister formation in the oral mucosa 
to inhibit protein interactions with less inflammation.

Testing for antiphospholipid antibodies could be an important part in 
determining the cause of a cerebrovascular event (CVE). Currently, it is also 
unknown whether antiphospholipid antibodies represent a risk factor for the 
development of a CVE and whether the selected therapy options are efficacious. 
So, this study aimed at (1) determining the frequency of patients experiencing a 
CVE and fulfilling the laboratory criterion for an antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS), (2) investigating whether the persistent presence of antiphospholipid 
antibodies represented a risk factor for a CVE, and (3) focusing on the efficacy 
of the selected treatment strategy in the first year after the CVE. Eighty-nine 
patients with an acute CVE were prospectively followed for 1 year. At least two 
sera from each were tested for lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin, 
anti-β2-glycoprotein I, anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin and anti-annexin V 
antibodies. Twenty out of eighty-nine (22%) of CVE patients fulfilled the 
criteria for APS (17/20 for definitive and 3 for probable APS). There was a 
significant association between persistently present antiphospholipid antibodies 
and the CVE (OR, 4.62). No statistically significant difference was found in the 
CVE recurrence rate between APS-CVE and non-APS-CVE patients being treated 
mainly with acetyl salicylic acid. Antiphospholipid antibodies represent an 
independent risk factor for a CVE. In the first year after the CVE, antiplatelet 
therapy seemed to be sufficient in secondary CVE thromboprophylaxis in most APS 
patients.

OBJECTIVES: Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) or Hirata disease is a rare cause 
of autoimmune hypoglycemia with apparent high insulin levels and anti-insulin 
autoantibodies and was first described by Hirata in Japan in 1970. IAS cases are 
usually related to exposure to sulfhydryl-containing drugs, which stimulate the 
production of insulin autoantibodies. Among sulfhydryl-containing compounds, 
alpha lipoic acid (ALA) has recently emerged as a cause of IAS. After the first 
observations of ALA-induced IAS were reported in Japan in 2006, an increasing 
number of cases related to ALA administration have been described. An Italian 
group recently reported on six cases of IAS of which one was associated with 
HLA-DRB1*04:06 and the remaining five with HLA-DRB1*04:03. This suggests that 
the latter is potentially involved in the genetic susceptibility of people of 
European descent to IAS.
METHODS: Here, we describe two new cases of IAS in women that were triggered by 
ALA.
RESULTS: Both cases are associated with HLA-DRB1*04:03 and confirm the evidence 
that HLA-DRB1*04:03 rather than HLA-DRB1*04:06 is specifically related to IAS 
susceptibility in Europeans.
CONCLUSIONS: Case reports of ALA-induced hypoglycemic episodes highlight the 
need for greater care in prescribing ALA supplementation as well as the 
identification of specific and personalized therapeutic targets.

Purpose: To quantify biomechanical change associated with autoimmune diseases 
using Corvis ST deformation data. Methods: Cross-sectional, observational, case 
control study of 76 patients with systemic autoimmune disease and 21 control 
subjects. All patients underwent detailed ophthalmic examination with Corvis-ST 
(Oculus Optikgerate Gmbh, Germany) measurements for biomechanical properties of 
the eye. Corneal deformation and also deformation caused by the extracorneal 
tissue were recorded. Using a mathematical formula, the three parameters, 
namely, corneal stiffness (kc), extracorneal tissue stiffness (kg), and 
extracorneal tissue viscosity (μg), were defined. Results: The biomechanical 
analysis showed that kc and μg were significantly lower in patients with 
systemic autoimmune disease with eye manifestations than control group. However 
statistically, it was significant in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients only. 
Conclusion: The new parameters, namely, kc, kg, and μg, can provide a sensitive 
marker of the ocular activity of the collagen vascular diseases.

Glucocorticoid monotherapy has been the mainstay treatment of giant cell 
arteritis (GCA) for decades. We aimed to evaluate the role of leflunomide as a 
steroid-sparing agent in GCA. This open-label study included incipient GCA 
patients followed for at least 48 weeks at a single secondary/tertiary 
rheumatology centre. At the time of diagnosis, patients received 
glucocorticoids. At week 12 of follow-up, leflunomide 10 mg qd was recommended 
as an adjunctive therapy to all patients without contraindications. The decision 
to start the leflunomide was patient-dependent. The number of relapses, a 
cumulative glucocorticoid dose during follow-up and treatment-related adverse 
events (AE) were recorded and compared between glucocorticoid-only and 
leflunomide groups. Seventy-six patients (65.8% female, median (IQR) age 73.7 
(66.1-78.8) years) were followed for a median (IQR) 96 (86-96) weeks. Thirty out 
of 76 (39.5%) patients received leflunomide at week 12 (leflunomide group); the 
others continued treatment with glucocorticoid (glucocorticoid-only group). 
During the first 48 weeks of follow-up, 22 patients relapsed, 4 (13.3%) in 
leflunomide group and 18 (39.1%) in glucocorticoid-only group. The difference 
was statistically significant (p = 0.02; NNT 3.9 (95% CI 2.2-17.4)). 
Furthermore, 17/30 (56.7%) patients in the leflunomide group managed to stop 
glucocorticoid at week 48 (with one relapse (5.9%) shortly afterwards). The 
cumulative glucocorticoid dose at the last visit was lower in the leflunomide 
group than in the glucocorticoid-only group (p = 0.01). Our findings indicate 
the steroid-sparing effect of leflunomide in GCA.

BACKGROUND: The presence of neuropatic pain (NeP) is common in subjects with 
established Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and it can influence the disease 
remission. These aspects have not been investigated in patients with Early 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (ERA).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of NeP on the achievement of remission in 
patients with ERA.
METHOD: The study involved consecutive ERA patients with moderate or high 
disease activity. The painDETECT Questionnaire (PDQ), the 36-item Short Form 
Health Survey (SF-36), and the Euro- QoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) were administered 
to all the patients, and their co-morbidity data were used to calculate their 
modified Rheumatic Disease Comorbidity Index (mRDCI). After six months' 
follow-up, the presence or otherwise of NeP in each individual patient was 
calculated, and whether or not the Boolean remission criteria were satisfied.
RESULTS: The study was completed by 115 patients (76% females) whose PDQ scores 
indicated that 13% had probable NeP. At the end of the follow-up period, 25 
patients (21.7%) met the Boolean remission criteria. Logistic regression 
analysis showed that baseline PDQ scores (p=0.0023) and the mRDCI (p=0.0054) 
were the strongest predictors of not being in Boolean remission. Only one of the 
15 patients with concomitant NeP achieved Boolean remission.
CONCLUSION: The presence of NeP may affect the achievement of remission in ERA 
patients. The PDQ can be a useful tool to measure central pain sensitisation in 
such patients.

Purpose: To analyze the outcomes of surgical procedures on inciting eye of 
patients with Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO). Methods: Retrospective study of 
patients with SO who underwent surgical procedures on inciting eyes between 
January 2000 and December 2015. Outcome measures included flare up of 
inflammation in either eye and change in visual acuity in the inciting eye. 
Results: Four SO patients underwent surgeries in their inciting eyes after 
adequate control of inflammation. Surgical procedures included penetrating 
keratoplasty, glaucoma drainage device implantation, pars plana vitrectomy, and 
silicon oil removal. Keratoplasty, glaucoma surgery, and silicon oil removal 
were well tolerated, with no flare up of disease. The patient who underwent pars 
plana vitrectomy, however, had a poor outcome. Conclusions: Surgical 
intervention in inciting eyes of patients with SO, after being adequately 
treated with oral steroids and immunosuppression, is a viable option for 
improving anatomic and functional outcomes in these eyes.

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role of the fractalkine (FKN)/CX3 CR1 pathway in 
joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: We examined the effect of treatment with anti-mouse FKN (anti-mFKN) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) on joint destruction and the migration of osteoclast 
precursors (OCPs) into the joint, using the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
model. DBA/1 mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen to induce 
arthritis, and then treated with anti-mFKN mAb. Disease severity was monitored 
by arthritis score, and joint destruction was evaluated by soft x-ray and 
histologic analyses. Plasma levels of joint destruction markers were assessed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FKN expression on endothelial cells was 
detected by immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow-derived OCPs were labeled with 
fluorescein and transferred to mice with CIA, and the migration of the OCPs to 
the joints was then analyzed.
RESULTS: Both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with anti-mFKN mAb 
significantly decreased the arthritis and soft x-ray scores. Plasma levels of 
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and matrix metalloproteinase 3 decreased 
after treatment with anti-mFKN mAb. Histologic analysis revealed that anti-mFKN 
mAb inhibited synovitis, pannus formation, and cartilage destruction, as well as 
suppressed bone damage, with a marked reduction in the number of 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts. Anti-mFKN mAb strongly 
inhibited the migration of bone marrow-derived OCPs into the affected synovium.
CONCLUSION: Anti-mFKN mAb notably ameliorates arthritis and joint destruction in 
the CIA model, as well as inhibits migration of OCPs into the synovium. These 
results suggest that inhibition of the FKN/CX3 CR1 pathway could be a novel 
strategy for treatment of both synovitis and joint destruction in rheumatoid 
arthritis.

Technology for precise and efficient genetic editing is constantly evolving and 
is now capable of human clinical applications. Autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases are chronic, disabling, sometimes life-threatening, conditions that 
feature heritable components. Both primary genetic lesions and the inflammatory 
pathobiology underlying these diseases represent fertile soil for new therapies 
based on the capabilities of gene editing. The ability to orchestrate precise 
targeted modifications to the genome will likely enable cell-based therapies for 
inflammatory diseases such as monogenic autoinflammatory disease, acquired 
autoimmune disease and for regenerative medicine in the setting of an 
inflammatory environment. Here, we discuss recent advances in genome editing and 
their evolving applications in immunoinflammatory diseases. Strengths and 
limitations of older genetic modification tools are compared with CRISPR/Cas9, 
base editing, RNA editing, targeted activators and repressors of transcription 
and targeted epigenetic modifiers. Commonly employed delivery vehicles to target 
cells or tissues of interest with genetic modification machinery, including 
viral, non-viral and cellular vectors, are described. Finally, applications in 
animal and human models of inflammatory diseases are discussed. Use of chimeric 
autoantigen receptor T cells, correction of monogenic diseases with genetically 
edited haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, engineering of induced 
pluripotent stem cells and ex vivo expansion and modification of regulatory T 
cells for a range of chronic inflammatory diseases are reviewed.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between serum levels of IL-37 in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients and percentage of peripheral blood T lymphocytes expressing 
the activation marker CD26 and investigate their correlation with disease 
activity.
METHODS: The study included 48 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 42 age and sex 
matched healthy controls. Serum levels of IL-37 were determined using enzyme 
linked immunosorbent assay while percentage of CD3+CD26+T cells in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells was assayed using flowcytometry.
RESULTS: Serum levels of IL-37, as well as the percentage of CD3+CD26+T cells, 
were significantly higher in rheumatoid arthritis patients than in healthy 
controls. Also, serum IL-37 levels were higher in patients with severe disease 
activity than patients with moderate and low disease activity. In rheumatoid 
arthritis patients, both serum levels of IL-37 and percentage of CD3+CD26+T 
cells correlated with disease activity (DAS28), C-reactive protein levels and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, serum levels of the 
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 positively correlated with the percentage of 
CD3+CD26+T cells in peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a strong correlation between serum levels of 
IL-37 and frequency of activated T cells in peripheral blood of rheumatoid 
arthritis patients. Our results suggest that in an active disease status, 
activated T lymphocytes may be a contributing source to the elevated levels of 
IL-37 trying to down-regulate the active inflammatory process.

PURPOSE: OnabotulinumtoxinA is a well described treatment of neurogenic 
overactive bladder. While motor effects on the detrusor muscle have been 
extensively studied, the sensory effects have not. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the impact of intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA injection on brain 
activity in female patients with multiple sclerosis and neurogenic overactive 
bladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 12 women with stable multiple 
sclerosis and neurogenic overactive bladder using concurrent functional magnetic 
resonance imaging and urodynamic studies prior to and 6 to 10 weeks following 
onabotulinumtoxinA injection. Individual functional magnetic resonance imaging 
activation maps at the time of strong urgency were averaged before and after 
onabotulinumtoxinA injection where areas of significant activation were 
identified.
RESULTS: After onabotulinumtoxinA injection functional magnetic resonance 
imaging activation increased in the right cingulate body (p = 0.0012), the left 
posterior cingulate (p = 0.02), the left anterior cingulate (p = 0.0015), the 
right prefrontal cortex (p = 0.0015), the insula (p = 0.0138) and the pons 
micturition center (p = 0.05). Sparse areas showed decreased activity, including 
the left cerebellum (p = 0.001), the left fusiform gyrus (p = 0.065) and the 
bilateral lentiform nucleus (p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: Intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA appeared to increase 
the activity of most brain regions known to be involved in the sensation and 
process of urinary urgency in female patients with multiple sclerosis and 
neurogenic overactive bladder. To our knowledge this is the first study of its 
kind to evaluate the possible effects of onabotulinumtoxinA at the human brain 
level where sensory awareness is located. This activation pattern may be used to 
further phenotype patients to optimize therapy or determine the sensory effects 
of onabotulinumtoxinA beyond the bladder.

OBJECTIVE: There is scarce information regarding the performance of a specific, 
structured education program addressed to patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) including both routine use 
of the therapy and patient experience evaluation. We aimed to assess the routine 
use of CSII and patient's experience and satisfaction regarding a specific 
structured patient self-management education and care program.
METHODS: A retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study collecting CSII 
routine use downloaded data. Patient experience and satisfaction were evaluated 
using an anonymous online survey covering different aspects of CSII 
self-management education and care program.
RESULTS: 380 T1D subjects were included (aged 45.3±12.17 years, 62.1% women, 
diabetes duration 27.8±10.3 years, 9.7±4.7 years on CSII, HbA1c 7.7+1.0%; 
61.0±7.9mmol/mol). Participants with HbA1c≤7.5% (58mmol/mol, n=178) did more 
SMBGs per day (4.4±2.1 vs. 3.9±1.9); used more boluses (5.0±1.8 vs. 4.5±2.0); 
the percentage of insulin given as bolus was higher (50.1±12.8 vs. 44.9±13.2%); 
the night bolus wizard (BW) high glucose target was lower (125.9±4.4 vs. 
130.5±12.8mg/dl) and time on CSII therapy was shorter (8.9±4.6 vs. 10.3±4.6 
years. p<0.05 all comparisons). More SMBG/day, shorter duration of CSII 
treatment, a lower BW low glucose target at night, a lower BW high glucose 
target at night, total insulin dose per day and total number of carbohydrates 
per day were related with better HbA1c levels. 60% of 373 patients answered the 
questionnaire. The response to the different aspects of the educational program 
was homogeneously highly satisfactory. Seventy-seven percent of patients scored 
the program as very useful. Ninety-three percent of CSII users would not return 
to their previous insulin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of routine clinical use of CSII by T1D patients 
demonstrates that glucose control may be associated with some pump usage and 
adherence parameters. The overall user experience and satisfaction with our CSII 
self-management education and care program was remarkably favorable.

OBJECTIVE: African American patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are 
at high risk for poor outcomes. Both patient characteristics and the severity of 
the disease may influence physician-patient interactions, which in turn can 
impact disease outcomes. We aimed to examine whether patient perceptions of 
interpersonal processes of care (i.e. physician-patient interactions) varied by 
demographic characteristics, disease activity, and/or depression in African 
American patients with SLE.
METHODS: The Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) is a cohort drawn from a 
population-based registry of people with SLE. We conducted a cross-sectional 
analysis of patient-reported data collected in 2016-17 among 698 African 
American participants (out of 863 GOAL participants). We assessed 
physician-patient interactions (communication, patient-centered decision making, 
and physician interpersonal style) through the Interpersonal Processes of Care 
survey (IPC-29), disease activity through the Systemic Lupus Activity 
Questionnaire, and depression through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Mean 
scores of the IPC-29 scales were compared by gender, age and educational 
attainment with Wilcoxon rank-sum 2-sample test or Kruskal Wallis test. We 
conducted linear trend test to examine demographic-adjusted scores of IPC across 
severity of disease activity and depression, and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses to examine the association of disease activity and 
depression with suboptimal IPC scores.
RESULTS: Overall, the lowest mean scores were observed for the patient-centered 
decision making domain, and specifically about how often doctors assessed 
patients' problems to follow recommendations and treatment among females 
compared with males (mean scores 3.13 ± 1.42 and 3.64 ± 1.38, respectively; 
p = 0.015). Mean scores for the assumed socioeconomic level subdomain (how often 
doctors make assumptions about a patient's socioeconomic level) were worse in 
individuals aged 18-34 (mean score 1.59 ± 0.94), compared to those aged 35-55 
(mean score 1.47 ± 0.94; p = 0.033). Patients with some college or higher 
educational attainment reported poorer mean scores for most communication and 
interpersonal style scales than those who reported high-school or less. We found 
significant linear trends of poorer scores for all communication scales across 
more severe disease activity and depression symptoms, and poorer scores for all 
interpersonal style scales across more severe disease activity. Multivariate 
models revealed that while depression was associated with suboptimal quality of 
both communication (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.04-1.39) and interpersonal style (OR 1.12; 
95% CI 1.01-1.25), disease activity only increased the odds of suboptimal 
interpersonal style (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.03-1.25).
CONCLUSION: In the African American population with SLE, suboptimal interactions 
with providers may be explained in part by the mental and physical symptoms of 
the patient, regardless of age, gender and education. In addition to standard of 
care treatment, SLE patients with more severe disease activity and depression 
might need provider-based interventions focused on communication and 
interpersonal style.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the size of unmet needs in the treatment of early 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (eRA), using all the conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and/or biological DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) in a long-term observational study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 538 patients with eRA were evaluated. The 2010 ACR/EULAR 
classification criteria were used. All patients were csDMARDs and bDMARDs-naive 
with disease duration less than one year. They were treated according to EULAR 
and ACR recommendations for RA. All the csDMARDs and bDMARDs were used. 
Clinical, laboratory findings with the disease activity score-28 and treatment 
decisions were all recorded as well as adverse drug reactions, reason of therapy 
termination, disease complications and comorbidities.
RESULTS: Methotrexate (58%) and Infliximab (37%) where the first csDMARD and 
bDMARD choice respectively. During follow-up, 14 patients were lost and 7 
developed comorbidities. The final results are referred to 517 patients. Among 
those, 66% were treated with csDMARDs as monotherapy or in combination therapy 
with sustained low disease activity (LDA). However, 3.2% from this group neither 
achieved LDA, nor received bDMARDs, due to comorbidities. On the other hand, 34% 
were treated with bDMARDs with or without csDMARDs. The majority of them 
demonstrated sustained LDA. From this group, 17.7% never achieved LDA, despite 
that they switched and received all bDMARDs. Thus, 20.9% of our patients never 
achieved LDA.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the current recommendations for RA therapy we successfully 
treated the majority of our patients. However, we found that the size of gap and 
the unmet needs for treatment is about 20%.

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) secondary to anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare life-threatening 
condition presenting with severe respiratory failure. The management of 
AAV-related DAH consists of remission induction immunosuppressive therapy, which 
requires time to be effective, with significant fatality rates despite 
appropriate treatment. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support 
gas exchanges providing the time necessary for immunosuppressive treatment to 
control the underlying disease in cases refractory to the conventional 
ventilation techniques. Despite severe preexisting bleeding has been considered 
a relative contraindication, ECMO has proven to be life-saving in several cases 
of respiratory failure associated with pulmonary haemorrhage due to various 
causes, including AAV. We reviewed the clinical presentation and course of two 
patients affected by AAV-related DAH treated at our Institution between 2012 and 
2017, whose management required the use of veno-venous ECMO. We reviewed the 
current literature on the role of ECMO in the support of these patients. In both 
patients, ECMO provided life support and allowed disease control, in combination 
with immunosuppressive treatment. Despite systemic anticoagulation, clinical 
improvement was achieved without exacerbation of the pulmonary bleeding. We 
performed a literature review, and summarized available data confirming the 
effectiveness and safety of ECMO in AAV-related DAH. ECMO has a life-saving role 
in the management of patients with severe respiratory failure due to 
ANCA-associated pulmonary capillaritis.

OBJECTIVE: Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are commonly considered to be 
unaffected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite synovitis and bone marrow edema 
being associated with radiographic progression in hand osteoarthritis (OA) and 
hand RA, radiographic courses differ substantially. This study was undertaken to 
analyze incidence and progression of radiographically evident DIP joint OA in RA 
patients, in relation to RA activity and patient characteristics.
METHODS: In sequential radiographs of 1,988 RA patients in the Swiss Clinical 
Quality Management in Rheumatic Diseases registry, we evaluated and scored 
15,904 DIP joints. Scoring was based on the presence of central erosions and 
subchondral sclerosis and on the severity of osteophytes and joint space 
narrowing, according to the modified Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grade. The presence 
of DIP joint OA was defined as ≥1 joint with a K/L grade of ≥2, and progression 
was defined as an increase in a summed K/L grade. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 4.5 years (interquartile range 3.1-7.0), 
and the mean ± SD age was 56.1 ± 11.1 years. DIP joint OA was present in 60% of 
patients at baseline. Higher mean age (OR 1.09 [95% CI 1.08-1.10]), female sex 
(OR 1.37 [95% CI 1.08-1.74]), and higher mean body mass index (OR 1.03 [95% CI 
1.00-1.06]) were associated with the presence of DIP joint OA, but neither the 
presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) (OR 0.72 [95% CI 
0.50-1.03]) nor the presence of rheumatoid factor (OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.74-1.38]) 
were associated with it. Disease Activity Score using the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint erosions were not 
associated with DIP joint OA progression. RA disease duration had no relevant 
effect size associated with DIP joint OA progression (OR 0.97 [95% CI 
0.96-0.99]).
CONCLUSION: Known risk factors for DIP joint OA were replicated in patients with 
RA. The observation that RA activity, the presence of ACPA, and MCP joint 
erosions were not associated with the prevalence or progression of DIP joint OA 
indicates that there are distinct roles of inflammation in the pathogenesis of 
RA and DIP joint OA.

AIM: To evaluate whether β cells continue to undergo death in the later stages 
of type 1 diabetes (T1D).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fasting banked sera from a cross-section of 90 
participants in the T1D Exchange Registry with longstanding T1D (median duration 
of 9 years) were analysed. Subjects were determined to be C-peptide (-) or (+) 
based on mixed-meal tolerance testing. Results were compared with 54 adult 
non-diabetic controls. Stimulated samples were assayed in a subset of subjects. 
Levels of unmethylated and methylated preproinsulin (INS) DNA were analysed 
using digital droplet PCR.
RESULTS: Fasting and stimulated circulating unmethylated INS DNA levels were 
increased among both C-peptide (-) and C-peptide (+) subjects with longstanding 
T1D compared with non-diabetic controls (P < 0.01). Consistent with prior 
reports, unmethylated INS DNA values correlated with methylated INS DNA values, 
which were also elevated among T1D subjects (P < 0.001). There was wide 
variation in the effects of mixed-meal stimulation on DNA levels, with fasting 
values in the highest quartiles decreasing with stimulation (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results could reflect ongoing β cell death in individuals 
with longstanding T1D, even in the absence of detectable C-peptide production, 
suggesting that therapies targeting β cell survival could be beneficial among 
individuals with longstanding T1D.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) develops from various etiologies, and it is 
often difficult to distinguish the etiology of TMA in kidney transplantation. 
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is one of the differential diagnoses for TMA 
that may cause acute loss of graft function or fatal thrombotic complications. 
This report details a 66-year-old male patient with polycythemia after 
ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. Antibody screening tests were negative 
before transplant. Despite administration of an adequate desensitization therapy 
including plasmapheresis and rituximab, he developed acute graft dysfunction on 
postoperative day 112 and graft biopsy revealed prominent microvascular 
inflammation in the glomerular capillaries without immunoglobulin deposits. Flow 
cytometric panel-reactive antibody screening failed to detect donor-specific 
antibodies at both pre-transplant and episode biopsies. Anticardiolipin antibody 
was repeatedly positive, but neither thrombosis nor previous thrombotic episodes 
were detected. After excluding several differential diagnoses, the graft 
dysfunction with unexplained TMA was treated with steroid pulse, plasmapheresis 
and rituximab re-induction. Anticardiolipin antibody disappeared after this 
intensive treatment and graft function recovered gradually and stabilized for 
52 months. This report suggests that asymptomatic anticardiolipin antibody may 
be associated with acute graft dysfunction. Even if thrombotic episodes are not 
observed, an exist of anticardiolipin antibody may be one of the risk factors of 
renal TMA after kidney transplantation.

Epidemiological data for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) differ according to ethnicity 
and geographical region. Moreover, despite of clear RA management guidelines, 
the implementation of treat-to-target (T2T) strategy often remains incomplete. 
Our objectives were to determine the incidence rate of RA, the clinical 
characteristics, and the level of adherence to the T2T guidelines in Slovenia. 
We analyzed prospectively the collected data of adult patients diagnosed with RA 
from 2014 through 2016 at the Department of Rheumatology, University Medical 
Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. The department provides rheumatology 
services to a well-defined region with a population of 704,000 adult residents. 
During the 3-year observation, we identified 341 incipient cases of RA (75% 
females, median (IQR) aged 64 (52.0-75.4) years), resulting in an annual 
incidence rate of 16.1 per 100,000 adults (95% CI 14.5-17.9). The incidence rate 
peaked in the 70-79-year age interval. The median time from the onset of 
symptoms suggestive of RA to rheumatology consultation was 12.9 (4.4-26.1) 
weeks, and the median time from referral to consultation was 1 (1-3) day. Within 
12 weeks of symptom onset, 161 (47.2%) incipient RA patients were examined by a 
rheumatologist, and 123 (36.1%) were started on DMARD therapy. The estimated 
incidence rate was in line with the available epidemiological data. Our early 
interventional clinic enabled us to identify and manage a substantial portion of 
RA patients within the recommended time frame.

(1)1 Diabetes Technology Consultants, Arlington, VA, USA.

Newly developed patch pumps are starting to occupy a noticeable fraction of the 
insulin delivery market. New entrants, using novel technologies, promise 
accurate, flexible insulin delivery at lower costs. In the section, we review 
the currently available devices, discuss some of the devices on the horizon, and 
speculate about some fascinating new approaches. In this first article, we 
provide an overview of the simplified devices-V-Go, PAQ, and One Touch Via-and 
of the more complex devices-Omnipod, Cellnovo, JewelPump, Solo, SFC Fluidics 
pump, Libertas, Medtronic pump, and EOPatch. We also discuss controllers, 
smartphones, and cybersecurity.

OBJECTIVE: Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) causes salivary gland impairment leading to 
oral dryness. Parotid sialo-cone-beam computerized tomography (sialo-CBCT) 
demonstrates ductal architecture and to a lesser extent gland activity. This 
study characterizes radiographic features of patients suspected for SjS and 
looks for a possible correlation with the diagnosis of SjS.
METHODS: The clinical and radiographic data of suspected SjS/dry mouth patients 
referred for sialo-CBCT in 2011-2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Two 
observers studied the scans for various radiographic features including duct 
morphology, level of branching, ductopenia and sialectasia. These features were 
analysed taking the specific clinical data and two sets of SjS criteria: The 
2002 American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and the 2012 American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) Group.
RESULTS: Sialo-CBCT scans of 67-referred patients suffering from dry mouth (115 
parotid glands) were included. Intraradiographic association was found between 
ductopenia and all other radiographic parameters. Minimal, yet important, 
radiographic differences were found between left and right parotid glands. 
AECG-confirmed-SjS patients showed strong correlation with radiographic 
features, whereas ACR 2012-confirmed-SjS patients did not.
CONCLUSION: Sialo-CBCT demonstrates novel radiographic features which may 
clarify the diagnosis of SjS. Further studies are needed to determine the role 
of sialo-CBCT in diagnosis of SjS.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis in individuals older than 
50 years, characterized by headaches, visual disturbances, painful scalp, jaw 
claudication, impairment of limb arteries, and systemic inflammation, among 
other symptoms. GCA diagnosis is confirmed by a positive temporal artery biopsy 
(TAB) or by imaging modalities. A prominent acute phase response with 
inflammation is the hallmark of the disease, predominantly targeting large- and 
medium-sized arteries leading to stenosis or occlusion of arterial lumen. To 
date, there are no reliable tissue markers specific for GCA. Scarce reports have 
indicated the importance of epigenetics in GCA. The current systematic review 
reports significantly changed candidate biomarkers in TABs of GCA patients 
compared to non-GCA patients using qPCR.

Artificial pancreas system (APS) is a viable option to treat diabetic patients. 
Researchers, however, have not conclusively determined the best control method 
for APS. Due to intra-/inter-variability of insulin absorption and action, an 
individualized algorithm is required to control blood glucose level (BGL) for 
each patient. To this end, we developed model predictive control (MPC) based on 
artificial neural networks (ANNs), which combines ANN for BGL prediction based 
on inputs and MPC for BGL control based on the ANN (NN-MPC). First, we developed 
a mathematical model for diabetic rats, which was used to identify individual 
virtual subjects by fitting to empirical data collected through an APS, 
including BGL data, insulin injection, and food intake. Then, the virtual 
subjects were used to generate datasets for training ANNs. The NN-MPC determines 
control actions (insulin injection) based on BGL predicted by the ANN. To 
evaluate the NN-MPC, we conducted experiments using four virtual subjects under 
three different scenarios. Overall, the NN-MPC maintained BGL within the normal 
range about 90% of the time with a mean absolute deviation of 4.7 mg/dl from a 
desired BGL. Our findings suggest that the NN-MPC can provide subject-specific 
BGL control in conjunction with a closed-loop APS. Graphical abstract ᅟ.

OBJECTIVE: Cardiac involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is often 
undiagnosed in its early phases. Specific heart biomarkers may identify patients 
at risk. We sought to investigate the prevalence and associated factors for such 
biomarkers in SLE.
METHODS: Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were 
measured simultaneously in 151 consecutive patients with no history of heart 
disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). None had electrocardiographic 
abnormalities suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Cross-sectional comparisons 
and logistic regression analyses were performed. Patients with abnormal 
biomarkers were investigated to delineate the specific cause.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients (16/151, 10.6%) had elevated BNP, and 9 of them also 
had abnormal cTnI. Compared to subjects with normal biomarkers, they were older, 
had longer disease and antimalarial (AM) use duration, and more frequently 
persistent creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation. Multivariable regression 
analysis showed prolonged AM treatment (> 5.6 yrs) and persistent CPK elevation 
to be important predictors for elevated cardiac biomarkers. Six patients were 
diagnosed with definite (based on endomyocardial biopsy, n = 2) or possible 
(based on cardiac magnetic resonance after exclusion of other causes) AM-induced 
cardiomyopathy (AMIC); all had both BNP and cTnI elevated. Alternative causes 
were identified in 5, while no definitive diagnosis could be made in the 
remaining patients.
CONCLUSION: About 10% of patients with SLE had elevated myocardial biomarkers, 
in the absence of prior cardiac disease or PAH. One-third of them were diagnosed 
with AMIC. Prolonged AM therapy and persistent CPK elevation conferred an 
increased risk for abnormal BNP and cTnI, which might predict AMIC.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity in the 
Portuguese population has not yet been estimated. However, the national 
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome remains high. The association of thyroid 
pathology with cardiovascular risk has been addressed but is still unclear. Our 
study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity 
and to assess the associations of thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid 
hormones and antibodies with metabolic syndrome, its components, and other 
possible determinants in a national sample.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study included a subsample of 486 randomly 
selected participants from a nationwide cross-sectional study sample of 4095 
adults. A structured questionnaire was administered on past medical history and 
socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics. Blood pressure and 
anthropometric measurements were collected, and the serum lipid profile, 
glucose, insulin, hs- CRP, TSH, FT4, FT3 and thyroid antibodies were measured.
RESULTS: In our sample, the prevalence of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and 
undiagnosed dysfunction was 4.9%, 2.5% and 72.2%, respectively. Overall, the 
prevalence of positivity for the thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies 
was 11.9% and 15.0%, respectively. A positive association was found between free 
triiodothyronine and metabolic syndrome (OR: 2.019; 95% CI: 1.196, 3.410). 
Additionally, thyroid peroxidase antibodies had a negative association with 
metabolic syndrome (OR: 0.465; 95% CI: 0.236, 0.917) and its triglyceride 
component (OR: 0.321; 95% CI: 0.124, 0.836).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of undiagnosed thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity 
was high. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negatively associated with 
metabolic syndrome and its triglyceride component, whereas the free 
triiodothyronine level was positively associated with metabolic syndrome.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) disease characterized 
by chronic neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage. Infiltration of 
activated lymphocytes and myeloid cells are thought to be primarily responsible 
for white matter damage and axonopathy. Several United States Food and Drug 
Administration-approved therapies exist that impede activated lymphocytes from 
entering the CNS thereby limiting new lesion formation in patients with 
relapse-remitting forms of MS. However, a significant challenge within the field 
of MS research is to develop effective and sustained therapies that allow for 
axonal protection and remyelination. In recent years, there has been increasing 
evidence that some kinds of stem cells and their derivatives seem to be able to 
mute neuroinflammation as well as promote remyelination and axonal integrity. 
Intracranial infection of mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse 
hepatitis virus (JHMV) results in immune-mediated demyelination and axonopathy, 
making this an excellent model to interrogate the therapeutic potential of stem 
cell derivatives in evoking remyelination. This review provides a succinct 
overview of our recent findings using intraspinal injection of mouse CNS neural 
progenitor cells and human neural precursors into JHMV-infected mice. 
JHMV-infected mice receiving these cells display extensive remyelination 
associated with axonal sparing. In addition, we discuss possible mechanisms 
associated with sustained clinical recovery. Developmental Dynamics 248:43-52,

OBJECTIVE: To report on the case of a patient with neonatal pemphigus that had 
extensive and critical skin lesions at birth.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A newborn male with extensive vesico-bullous lesions on the 
anterior side of his chest and abdomen at birth. He was admitted to the 
pediatric ward of a hospital for an etiological diagnosis and for treatment. 
Based on maternal history and a clinical evaluation, the patient was diagnosed 
with neonatal vulgar pemphigus. His progression was satisfactory and, in the 
end, he did not need pharmacological interventions.
COMMENTS: The cases reported in the literature and the references evaluated 
reveal that neonatal pemphigus is rare, but that knowledge about the disease 
allows for an early diagnosis to be made. This has great clinical relevance 
considering that the disease usually manifests itself in the form of extensive 
epidermal lesions, even though it is transient and benign, it does not require 
specific treatment, and it does not have any relation with possible future 
diseases.

neonatal. O paciente apresentou evolução satisfatória, sem a necessidade de 
intervenção farmacológica.
COMENTÁRIOS: Os casos descritos na literatura e as referências avaliadas revelam 
o pênfigo neonatal como uma doença de ocorrência rara, porém cujo conhecimento e 
diagnóstico precoce têm grande relevância clínica, considerando-se que 
geralmente se manifesta com lesões epidérmicas extensas e de aspecto crítico, 
embora apresente curso clínico transitório e benigno, sem necessidade de 
tratamento específico e sem relação com doença futura.

BACKGROUND: The clinicopathological significance of immunofluorescent findings 
in IgA nephropathy remains controversial.
METHODS: The relations of the deposition of IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q and 
fibrinogen (Fib) with pathological findings, baseline clinical findings, and 
renal outcome were evaluated in 688 patients with IgA nephropathy. Pathological 
features included cellular or fibrocellular crescents, endocapillary or 
mesangial hypercellularity, segmental or global glomerulosclerosis and the 
Oxford classification.
RESULTS: The median age at biopsy was 30 years. There were 289 men. With 
74 months median follow-up, 32% of patients received steroids. Twelve percent of 
patients developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The degree of IgA was closely 
related to the degree of C3, IgG and IgM deposition. The degree of IgA, C3, IgG 
and Fib deposition was significantly related to the percentage of glomeruli with 
crescent, endocapillary and mesangial hypercellularity. IgM deposition showed 
significant association with crescent, mesangial hypercellularity, segmental 
sclerosis, global glomerulosclerosis and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis. 
In the patients treated with steroids, the risk for ESRD in patients with 
2-3+ IgA deposition was significantly lower with reference of 1+ IgA deposition.
CONCLUSION: We found the different roles of glomerular immune reactants' 
deposition in the inflammatory process from acute to chronic stage. IgA 
deposition together with IgG, Fib and C3 may produce acute inflammatory injury. 
IgM deposition might occur in the early stage of inflammation and remains until 
late sclerotic stage. The prominent deposition of IgA related to low risk for 
ESRD in patients who received steroids might suggest effectiveness of steroids 
in such patients.

PURPOSE: To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of conventional 18F-FDG PET/CT of 
cranial arteries in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA).
METHODS: The study was a retrospective case-control study. The reference 
diagnosis was fulfillment of the 1990 ACR criteria for GCA. All patients had 
new-onset GCA. Conventional 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed before glucocorticoid 
treatment. Controls were age- and sex-matched patients with a previous history 
of malignant melanoma (MM) undergoing surveillance PET/CT >6 months after MM 
resection. PET images were evenly cropped to include only head and neck and were 
assessed in random order by four nuclear medicine physicians blinded to 
reference diagnosis. Temporal (TA), maxillary (MA) and vertebral (VA) arteries 
were visually rated for 18F-FDG uptake. Interreader agreement was evaluated by 
Fleiss kappa.
RESULTS: A total of 44 patients and 44 controls were identified. In both groups, 
the mean age was 69 years (p = 0.45) and 25/44 were women. 35/41 GCA 
patients were temporal artery biopsy positive (TAB). Considering only FDG uptake 
in TA and/or MA, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was 64 and 100%. 
Including VA, sensitivity increased to 82% and specificity remained 100%. 
Interreader agreement was 91% and Fleiss kappa 0.82 for the PET diagnosis based 
on the cranial arteries.
CONCLUSION: Conventional 18F-FDG PET/CT is an accurate and reliable tool to 
diagnose cranial arteritis in glucocorticoid-naïve GCA patients. The high 
diagnostic specificity suggests that TAB can be omitted in patients with 18F-FDG 
uptake in cranial arteries. 18F-FDG PET/CT performed in patients with suspected 
vasculitis should always include the head and neck.

BACKGROUND: We compared pre-emptive transplant rates between SLE and non-SLE 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) and 
investigated the potential influence of frequency matching and primary ESRD 
causes in the non-SLE group.
METHODS: 4830 adult SLE patients with incident ESRD from USRDS 2005-2009 were 
frequency matched by age, sex and race to 4830 patients with incident non-SLE 
ESRD. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of 
pre-emptive transplantation in SLE and non-SLE, and with the non-SLE subgroups 
by primary ESRD cause.
RESULTS: The odds ratios (OR) of receiving a pre-emptive transplant were similar 
among non-SLE and SLE (referent group): OR = 1.18 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.50; 
p = 0.20). However, the ORs for receiving a pre-emptive transplant were 0.19 
(95% CI: 0.08, 0.42) in type 2 diabetes ESRD, 0.42 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.75) for 
hypertension-associated ESRD, 1.67 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.54) in type 1 diabetes ESRD, 
and 2.06 (95% CI: 1.55, 2.73) for "other" ESRD. In contrast to non-SLE, younger 
SLE patients were less likely to receive a pre-emptive transplant than older SLE 
patients.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide compelling evidence that major 
improvements need to be made in optimizing access to pre-emptive transplantation 
in SLE by addressing sociodemographic disparities and the unique challenges 
faced by SLE patients. Applying careful matching and selecting appropriate 
comparison groups in future studies may facilitate the development of effective 
strategies to address these barriers and to increase the number of pre-emptive 
renal transplants among SLE patients.

Cancer patients occasionally have anemia with high mean corpuscular volume in 
addition to iron deficiency anemia. Secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) 
following cancer is also observed with low frequency. To date, no causal 
mechanisms for these disease states have been reported. Here, we present the 
case of an 80-year-old woman with AIHA that was resistant to prednisolone. 
Further examinations revealed primary adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon and 
primary squamous cell carcinoma in the right lung. After resections of these 
tumors, her anemia partially improved until a colon cancer-derived metastatic 
tumor was detected in the left lung. Immunoprecipitation of erythrocyte membrane 
proteins with an autoantibody followed by mass spectrometry/Western blotting 
identified band 3 as the target of the autoantibody. Immunohistochemical 
analysis revealed ectopic expression of band 3 in the colon adenocarcinoma. To 
our knowledge, this is the first report that identifies the cause in a case of 
anemia without bleeding in a cancer patient and that defines a mechanism 
underlying secondary AIHA following cancer progression.

BACKGROUND: Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterised by 
exocrinopathy mainly involving the salivary and lacrimal glands. In addition, it 
is a multisystemic condition (i.e., affecting multiple organs and systems). 
Neurological involvement has been reported in ~20% of cases, with peripheral 
manifestations being the most frequent.
METHODS: We analysed four cases in which neurological manifestations were the 
first symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome.
RESULTS: In all four cases, neurological symptoms preceded sicca symptoms. In 
addition, immunosuppressive treatment with steroids and, in some cases, 
cyclophosphamide showed improvement.
CONCLUSION: Neurological involvement in Sjögren's syndrome is common and often 
occurs as the first clinical manifestation. Since evidence is limited, more 
studies are required in order to determine appropriate diagnostic methods and 
treatments for each manifestation of Sjögren's syndrome.

A 73-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis 
(AIP) without kidney lesions. She was treated with prednisolone (PSL) 30 mg/day, 
and her AIP symptoms promptly improved, after which the PSL dose was gradually 
tapered to 5 mg/day. Her renal function had remained normal (serum creatinine 
0.7 mg/dL) until 1 year before the current admission without any imaging 
abnormalities in the kidney. However, during this past year her renal function 
gradually declined (serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL). Follow-up computed tomography 
incidentally revealed unilateral renal atrophy, which rapidly progressed during 
the subsequent 10-month period without left kidney atrophy. A diagnosis of 
IgG4-RKD probably due to TIN was made, and we increased the dose of prednisolone 
to 30 mg/day. 1 month after administration, multiple low-density lesions on both 
kidneys were improved slightly but almost all lesions persisted as atrophic 
scars. Our case suggested that unilateral renal atrophy can develop in patients 
with IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis without hydronephrosis caused by 
retroperitoneal fibrosis, and that monitoring the serum creatinine levels is not 
always sufficient, thereby highlighting the importance of regular imaging 
monitoring to detect newly developing kidney lesions.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common vasculitis in adults aged 
≥ 50 years in Europe. Recently, colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDS) and 
positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) have improved the 
diagnostic sensitivity. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of 
GCA in a well-defined Slovenian region, supported by the temporal artery (TA) 
biopsy (TAB) or CDS or PET/CT. This prospective study was conducted at the 
University Medical Centre Ljubljana, the only secondary/tertiary centre in the 
region, serving a population of 323,297 residents aged ≥ 50 years. Patients with 
suspected GCA are referred either to the Department of Rheumatology, or in case 
of severe visual disturbances, to the Department of Ophthalmology. We included 
all GCA cases diagnosed between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2017. We 
diagnosed cranial GCA (c-GCA) using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
1990 classification criteria and a positive TAB or TA-CDS. Large vessel GCA 
(lv-GCA) was diagnosed using CDS or PET/CT. During the 6-year observation, we 
identified 169 incipient GCA cases (66.3% female, median (IQR) age of 75.1 
(68.6-80.0) years). Forty-two (24.8%) patients had lv-GCA, and the others had 
c-GCA. The estimated annual incidence rates of GCA were overall 8.7 (95% CI 
7.5-10.1), c-GCA 6.5 (95% CI 5.5-7.8) and lv-GCA 2.2 (95%CI 1.6-2.9) per 100,000 
aged ≥ 50 years. GCA is the most common vasculitis in adults aged ≥ 50 years, 
with an annual incidence rate of 8.7 per 100,000.

OBJECTIVE: There are variable reports of risk of concordance for progression to 
islet autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes in identical twins after one twin is 
diagnosed. We examined development of positive autoantibodies and type 1 
diabetes and the effects of genetic factors and common environment on 
autoantibody positivity in identical twins, nonidentical twins, and full 
siblings.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention 
Study (N = 48,026) were screened from 2004 to 2015 for islet autoantibodies (GAD 
antibody [GADA], insulinoma-associated antigen 2 [IA-2A], and autoantibodies 
against insulin [IAA]). Of these subjects, 17,226 (157 identical twins, 283 
nonidentical twins, and 16,786 full siblings) were followed for autoantibody 
positivity or type 1 diabetes for a median of 2.1 years.
RESULTS: At screening, identical twins were more likely to have positive GADA, 
IA-2A, and IAA than nonidentical twins or full siblings (all P < 0.0001). 
Younger age, male sex, and genetic factors were significant factors for 
expression of IA-2A, IAA, one or more positive autoantibodies, and two or more 
positive autoantibodies (all P ≤ 0.03). Initially autoantibody-positive 
identical twins had a 69% risk of diabetes by 3 years compared with 1.5% for 
initially autoantibody-negative identical twins. In nonidentical twins, type 1 
diabetes risk by 3 years was 72% for initially multiple autoantibody-positive, 
13% for single autoantibody-positive, and 0% for initially autoantibody-negative 
nonidentical twins. Full siblings had a 3-year type 1 diabetes risk of 47% for 
multiple autoantibody-positive, 12% for single autoantibody-positive, and 0.5% 
for initially autoantibody-negative subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of type 1 diabetes at 3 years is high for initially multiple 
and single autoantibody-positive identical twins and multiple 
autoantibody-positive nonidentical twins. Genetic predisposition, age, and male 
sex are significant risk factors for development of positive autoantibodies in 
twins.

BACKGROUND: Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) have yielded promising efficacy 
signals in early-phase clinical trials of ischemic and nonischemic 
cardiomyopathy. The potential efficacy of CDCs in acute myocarditis, an 
inflammatory cardiomyopathy without effective therapy, remains unexplored. Given 
that CDCs produce regenerative, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and 
anti-fibrotic effects (all of which could be beneficial in acute myocarditis), 
we investigated the efficacy of intracoronary delivery of CDCs in a rat model of 
experimental autoimmune myocarditis.
METHODS: Lewis rats underwent induction of experimental autoimmune myocarditis 
by subcutaneous footpad injection of purified porcine cardiac myosin 
supplemented with Mycobacterium tuberculosis on days 1 and 7. On day 10, rats 
were randomly assigned to receive global intracoronary delivery of 500 000 CDCs 
or vehicle. Global intracoronary delivery was performed by injection of cells or 
vehicle into the left ventricular (LV) cavity during transient occlusion of the 
aortic root. Rats were euthanized 18 days after infusion. Cardiac volumes and 
systolic function were assessed by serial echocardiography, performed on days 1, 
10, and 28. Myocardial inflammation, T-cell infiltration, and cardiac fibrosis 
were evaluated by histology.
RESULTS: Experimental autoimmune myocarditis was successfully induced in 14/14 
rats that completed follow-up. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and 
volumes were comparable on days 1 and 10 between groups. CDC infusion resulted 
in increased LVEF (81.5% ± 3% vs 65.4% ± 8%, P < .001) and decreased LV 
end-systolic volume (43 ± 15 vs 100 ± 24 μL, P < .001) compared to placebo 
administration at 18 days post-infusion. Cardiosphere-derived cell infusion 
decreased myocardial inflammation (7.4% ± 7% vs 20.7% ± 4% of myocardium, P = 
.007), cardiac fibrosis (16.6% ± 13% vs 38.1% ± 3% of myocardium, P = .008), and 
myocardial T-cell infiltration (30.4 ± 29 vs 125.8 ± 49 cells per field, P = 
.005) at 18 days post-infusion compared to placebo administration.
CONCLUSION: Intracoronary delivery of CDCs attenuates myocardial inflammation, 
T-cell infiltration, and fibrosis while preventing myocarditis-induced systolic 
dysfunction and adverse remodeling in rats with experimental autoimmune 
myocarditis.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) can be 
associated with the development of immune-system dysfunctions.The aim of this 
work is to correlate SNPs of miRNA-146a and its target gene, IRAK1, with 
susceptibility, clinical manifestations, and diseases progression in patients 
with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Genotyping 
for miRNA-146a (rs2910164) and its target gene IRAK1 (rs3027898) was performed 
using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 80 patients with SLE and 
70 patients with MS, as well as 120 healthy control individuals. A statistically 
significant difference was found between the frequencies of the genotypes and 
alleles of miRNA-146a (rs2910164) and IRAK1 (rs3027898), compared with the 
control group. Also, whereas the mutant allele G of miRNA-146a may be a factor 
in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis, the mutant allele C of IRAK1 may play a 
role in lupus arthritis. Both genes may contribute to the susceptibility of 
patients to SLE and MS.

AIMS: To assess HbA1c values and hospitalization rates before, during and after 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy.
METHODS: Demographic and hospitalization data were extracted from 161 
individuals with Type 1 diabetes who received continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion (CSII) therapy between 2002 and 2013 at the Leeds Children and Young 
People's Diabetes Service for those aged < 20 years. The median (range) age at 
CSII start was 11.9 (1.1-17.6) years. The median (range) follow-up time was 2.3 
(0-8.1) years. Random intercept models were used to compare HbA1c values before 
and during CSII initiation (and after CSII for those who discontinued it). 
Hospitalization rates were calculated for diabetic ketoacidosis and severe 
hypoglycaemia.
RESULTS: The mean HbA1c concentration decreased by 7 mmol/mol [95% CI 6-8; 0.6% 
(95% CI 0.5-0.7%)]. For the discontinued group (n=30), mean HbA1c decreased by 5 
mmol/mol [95% CI 2-8; 0.4% (95% CI 0.2-0.7%)]. HbA1c returned to pre-CSII start 
levels at the end of this therapy. Diabetic ketoacidosis admissions increased 
threefold during CSII compared with before CSII start [2.2 per 100 person-years 
(95% CI 1.3 to 3.6) vs 7.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 5.1 to 10.8)] and was 
highest during the first year of CSII. No difference in severe hypoglycaemia 
incidence rate was found during CSII compared with the pre-CSII period.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant reductions in HbA1c levels for individuals 
treated with CSII, improvements are needed to reduce diabetic ketoacidosis 
hospitalizations for those new to the therapy.

Type 1 Diabetes-related Autoantibodies in Different Forms of Diabetes.

Medicine and Health Sciences, NTNU, Norwegian University of Science and 
Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

Autoantibodies against Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GADA), insulinoma antigen-2 
(IA- 2A), insulin (IAA) and the most recently Zinc Transporter 8 (ZnT8A) are one 
of the most reliable biomarkers for autoimmune diabetes in both children and 
adults. They are today the only biomarkers that can distinguish Latent 
Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) from phenotypically type 2 diabetes. As the 
frequency of autoantibodies at diagnosis in childhood type 1 diabetes depends on 
age, GADA is by far the most common in adult onset autoimmune diabetes, 
especially LADA. Being multiple autoantibody positive have also shown to be more 
common in childhood diabetes compared to adult onset diabetes, and multiple 
autoantibody positivity have a high predictive value of childhood type 1 
diabetes. Autoantibodies have shown inconsistent results to predict diabetes in 
adults. Levels of autoantibodies are reported to cause heterogeneity in LADA. 
Reports indicate that individuals with high levels of autoantibodies have a more 
type 1 diabetes like phenotype and individuals with low levels of autoantibody 
positivity have a more type 2 diabetes like phenotype. It is also well known 
that autoantibody levels can fluctuate and transient autoantibody positivity in 
adult onset autoimmune diabetes have been reported to affect the phenotype.

Genetic Aspects of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults: A Mini-Review.

Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Diabetes is a multifactorial disease, caused by a complex interplay between 
environmental and genetic risk factors. Genetic determinants of particularly 
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) have been studied extensively, 
whereas well-powered studies of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) are 
lacking. So far available studies support a clear genetic overlap between LADA 
and T1D, however, with smaller effect sizes of the T1D-risk variants in LADA as 
compared to T1D. A genetic overlap between LADA and T2D is less clear. However, 
recent studies, including large numbers of LADA patients, provide different 
lines of evidence to support a genetic overlap between T2D and LADA. The genetic 
predisposition to LADA is yet to be explored in a study design, like a genome- 
wide association study, which allows for analyses of the genetic predisposition 
independently of prior hypothesis about potential candidate genes. This type of 
study may facilitate the discovery of risk variants associated with LADA 
independently of T1D and T2D, and is central in order to determine if LADA 
should be considered as an independent diabetic subtype. Extended knowledge 
about the genetic predisposition to LADA may also facilitate stratification of 
the heterogeneous group of LADA patients, which may assist the choice of 
treatment. This mini-review summarizes current knowledge of the genetics of 
LADA, and discusses the perspectives for future studies.

Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1 Engagement Inhibits T 
Cell-B Cell Interaction and Diminishes Interleukin-6 Production and Plasmablast 
Differentiation in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

OBJECTIVE: Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1) 
homophilic interactions promote immunoglobulin production and T cell-B cell 
cross-talk. SLAMF1 is overexpressed on T and B cells in patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study was undertaken to determine the role of 
SLAMF1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in modulating T cell-B cell interaction and B 
cell activation.
METHODS: Anti-IgM-prestimulated naive or total B cells from either healthy 
donors or patients with SLE were cocultured with autologous T cells under 
CD3/CD28 stimulation, in the presence or absence of the SLAMF1 mAb. Naive B 
cells were stimulated with anti-IgM and CD40L in the presence of the SLAMF1 
antibody. Cytokine production by CD4+ T cells and B cells was examined by flow 
cytometry and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Plasmablast formation 
and T cell and B cell conjugates were assessed by flow cytometry. IgG and 
antinuclear antibody production was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay.
RESULTS: SLAMF1 ligation in a human peripheral blood T cell-B cell culture 
system reduced the following in both healthy controls and patients with SLE: 
conjugate formation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by B cells, IL-21 and 
IL-17A production by T cells, and Ig and autoantibody production. Whereas the 
SLAMF1 mAb directly affected the function of isolated peripheral B cells by 
decreasing IL-6 and Ig production in vitro, it did not affect cytokine 
production by isolated T cells stimulated in vitro.
CONCLUSION: The SLAMF1 antibody inhibits T cell-B cell interaction and 
suppresses B cell cytokine production and differentiation, thereby acting as a 
potential therapeutic tool in the treatment of patients with SLE.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prophylactic effect of sulfasalazine against 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
METHODS: We used a nationwide Japanese multicenter RA database to extract data 
from 2005 and 2014. To identify PJP cases, we selected patients hospitalized for 
PJP and verified their diagnosis. Two control groups, one unmatched and the 
other matched for age, sex, glucocorticoid, methotrexate, and tacrolimus dosage, 
and the use (and type, if used) of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drug were selected by incidence-density sampling. The odds ratios for PJP 
associated with sulfasalazine use and other clinical factors were estimated by 
exact and standard conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: From 18,668 participants, 60 cases, 356 unmatched controls, and 337 
matched controls were selected. None of the cases received sulfasalazine before 
PJP onset. A comparison of the cases with the unmatched controls showed that 
sulfasalazine use carried a decreased risk of PJP (adjusted odds ratio 0.18, 95% 
confidence interval 0.00-0.92). A comparison of the cases and matched controls 
also showed that sulfasalazine use had a decreased risk of PJP (0.08, 
0.00-0.36). In an analysis of the cases and unmatched controls who did not 
receive sulfasalazine, an increased risk of PJP was associated with lung disease 
(3.88, 1.89-7.95) and the use of glucocorticoid (5.71, 2.68-12.19), methotrexate 
(5.25, 2.01-13.74), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (2.32, 1.10-4.93).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this nested case-control study demonstrated the 
preventive effect of sulfasalazine against PJP. The results await confirmation 
by future prospective studies.

INTRODUCTION: We sought to translate, cross-culturally adapt, and evaluate the 
internal consistency and validity of the Chinese version of the 15-Item 
Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life (MG-QOL15).
METHODS: Translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the MG-QOL15 were 
performed. We used Cronbach's α to test internal consistency, one-way analysis 
of variance to test construct validity, and Pearson or Spearman correlations to 
test discriminant and concurrent validity.
RESULTS: We enrolled 168 outpatients. Internal consistency was excellent 
(Cronbach's α = 0.928). The MG-QOL15 discriminated MG severity as stratified by 
the MG Composite (MGC; P < 0.001) and Osserman class (P = 0.01). Concurrent 
validity was low to moderate with the subscales of the 36-item Short Form (-0.31 
to ∼-0.59), MGC (r = 0.46), and Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living 
profile (r = 0.54).
DISCUSSION: The Chinese MG-QOL15 showed comparable construct, discriminant and 
concurrent validity, and internal consistency with to the original version.

Gelsemium elegans Benth. is a toxic plant that has been used as an ancient 
Chinese herbal remedy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and nervous pain, 
spasticity, skin ulcers, and cancers. Koumine, one of its representative 
alkaloids, shows numerous promising pharmacological activities, including 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Here, we investigated the analgesic 
effect of koumine on the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model of RA and 
explored the potential pharmacological mechanisms underlying the analgesia. In 
the CIA rats, repeated koumine treatments significantly reduced pain compared to 
controls and attenuated the collagen-induced increase in levels of glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour 
necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Cultured astrocytes showed 
reduced astrocyte reactivation and decreased production of both tested 
cytokines. Based on our results, koumine exerted both analgesic and 
anti-inflammatory effects on the CIA rat model that were apparently mediated by 
inhibiting astrocyte reactivation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

Inflammasomes are protein complexes activated by infection and cellular stress 
that promote caspase-1 activation and subsequent inflammatory cytokine 
processing and cell death. It has been anticipated that inflammasome activity 
contributes to autoimmunity. However, we previously showed that macrophages from 
autoimmune New Zealand Black (NZB) mice lack NLRP3 inflammasome function, and 
their absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome responses are compromised by high 
expression of the AIM2 antagonist protein p202. Here we found that the point 
mutation leading to lack of NLRP3 expression occurred early in the NZB strain 
establishment, as it is shared with the related obese strain New Zealand Obese, 
but not with the unrelated New Zealand White (NZW) strain. The first cross 
progeny of NZB and NZW mice develop more severe lupus nephritis than the NZB 
strain. We have compared AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasome function in macrophages 
from NZB, NZW, and NZB/W F1 mice. The NZW parental strain showed strong 
inflammasome function, whereas the NZB/W F1 have haploinsufficient expression of 
NLRP3 and show reduced NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome responses, particularly at 
low stimulus strength. It remains to be established whether the low inflammasome 
function could contribute to loss of tolerance and the onset of autoimmunity in 
NZB and NZB/W F1. However, with amplifying inflammatory stimuli through the 
course of disease, the NLRP3 response in the NZB/W F1 may be sufficient to 
contribute to kidney damage at later stages of disease.

AIM: To survey the model of care and workforce that manages children and 
adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Australasia along with glycaemic 
outcomes.
METHODS: Tertiary and regional paediatric clinics in Australia and New Zealand 
(NZ) caring for children and adolescents with diabetes were invited to complete 
an online survey assessing health-care professional (HCP) workforce numbers and 
available clinical data for the 2016 calendar year.
RESULTS: A total of 38 sites responded - 25 Australian (10 tertiary, 15 
regional), 13 NZ (4 tertiary, 8 regional) - representing 9715 children with T1D. 
HCP resourcing varied across sites, with overall HCP/100 patient ratios of: 
doctors: 0.36 (0.08-1.07), nurses: 0.72 (0-1.8), dieticians: 0.19 (0-0.49) and 
psychologist/social workers: 0.13 (0-0.36). Overall, 39% of patients used 
insulin pump therapy (CSII) (29.5% NZ, 40.8% Australia). Databases were being 
used locally by 26 sites. Thirty-two sites reported the mean clinic HbA1c, mean 
HbA1c 66 mmol/mol (8.2%) (NZ = 69 mmol/mol (8.5%), Australia = 66 mmol/mol 
(8.2%)), with 29% of patients attaining the recommended HbA1c target of 
<58 mmol/mol (7.5%) (NZ = 28%, Australia = 29%).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest Australasian paediatric T1D workforce survey to 
date. HCP to patient ratios remain well below international recommendations and 
have not changed over the last 5-7 years. Glycaemic outcomes in this population 
were below recommended levels in the majority of patients. There is an urgent 
need to reform models of care and workforce and to institute systematic 
benchmarking in both countries in order to prevent acute and chronic 
complications of T1D.

The objectives of this study are to determine whether the 2016 European League 
Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology/Paediatric Rheumatology 
International Trials Organization classification criteria for macrophage 
activation syndrome (MAS) complicating systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(SJIA) can be used to identify MAS in patients with adult-onset Still's disease 
(AOSD). Using laboratory data from 76 AOSD patients with and without MAS, we 
analyzed the ability of the collective and individual constitutive elements of 
the 2016 MAS in SJIA criteria and additional laboratory measures to discriminate 
between AOSD patients with (n = 16) and without (n = 60) MAS. Cutoff values to 
determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated 
from receiver operating characteristic curves, and modified classification 
criteria for MAS in AOSD were evaluated. The 2016 MAS in SJIA classification 
criteria had an overall sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 70.0%, positive 
predictive value of 47.1%, and negative predictive value of 100% to discriminate 
between AOSD patients with and without MAS based on laboratory data. Among the 
individual criteria, the sensitivity of triglycerides (46.7%) and the 
specificity of ferritin (15.0%) for MAS in AOSD were particularly low. The 
sensitivity and specificity for classifying MAS in AOSD patients were increased 
to 100 and 93%, respectively, by excluding triglycerides and changing the cutoff 
values for other criteria in the 2016 MAS in SJIA classification. The 2016 
classification criteria for MAS in SJIA had higher sensitivity but lower 
specificity to identify MAS in AOSD patients compared with SJIA patients.

Retrospective analysis of a single-center clinical experience toward development 
of curative treatment of 123 pemphigus patients with a long-term follow-up: 
efficacy and safety of the multidrug protocol combining intravenous 
immunoglobulin with the cytotoxic immunosuppressor and mitochondrion-protecting 
drugs.

Immunology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a life-long IgG autoantibody-mediated 
blistering disease affecting the mucosal surfaces lined by the stratified 
epithelium (oral, nasal, genital) and sometimes also the skin. While 
corticosteroid treatment is life saving, the high dose and prolonged courses 
required for disease control are associated with significant adverse effects, 
including death. Although introduction of rituximab (RTX) provided for a 
favorable outcome, the high relapse rate, that is, up to 80%, precludes 
successful use of RTX as a monotherapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is 
being increasingly utilized as off-label therapy for a variety of autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases, including PV and pemphigus foliaceus (PF).
AIMS: The goal of pemphigus research is to develop an effective treatment 
modality that would allow patients to achieve and maintain a stable clinical 
remission without the need for additional treatments, or cure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article summarizes clinical outcome of 123 pemphigus 
patients treated with a combination of IVIg, an immunosuppressive cytotoxic drug 
(ICD) and mitochondrion-protecting drugs in the Blistering Disease Clinic at the 
University of California, Irvine from 2007 to 2017.
RESULTS: The mean time to disease control was 0.2 months and time to complete 
remission - 1.7 months. Duration of complete remission on drugs until relapse or 
end of treatment was 19.3 months. The mean duration of complete remission off 
drugs until relapse was 15.8 months. That until end of follow up was 48.4 
months, with a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 91 months. The overall complete 
remission rate off all drugs was 100%, with 12% overall relapse rate. Most 
relapses, 8.1 vs. 3.3%, occurred during the time of treatment, compared to 
posttreatment. No patients had more than a single relapse. The duration of the 
posttreatment follow-up ranged from 9 to 97 months with a mean of 64.8 months, 
or 5.4 years. The total number of IVIg cycles ranged from 26 in patients without 
a relapse to 37 in patients with a relapse. The clinical outcome in patients 
that received IVIg with RTX or another ICD were found to be very similar.
DISCUSSION: Thus, the multidrug IVIg regimen allowed to achieve three principal 
treatment objectives: (i) rapid control of pemphigus symptoms; (ii) stable 
disease remission; and (iii) overall safety of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: While the individualized therapeutic approaches to eradicate the 
autoreactive B cell clones causing disease in each particular PV or PF patient 
are being developed, all pemphigus patients can benefit from the treatment 
protocol described in this study.

INTRODUCTION: The early suspension of Altitude trial in recent years has induced 
most nephrologists and cardiologists to abandon Aliskiren use. Consequently, the 
potential usefulness of the direct renin inhibition in IgA glomerulonephritis 
remained an under-investigated therapeutic option.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 53 years old IgA GMN patient unresponsive 
to all conventional anti-angiotensin-2 agents, steroids and immunosuppressants, 
in which the administration of Aliskiren permitted to achieve and maintain a 
complete proteinuria remission in the absence of any adverse event.
CONCLUSION: Aliskiren might represent a valid and safe therapeutic option in IgA 
GMN, although further investigations would be needed to confirm this conclusion.

This randomized control trial investigated glucose control with closed-loop (CL) 
versus threshold-low-glucose-suspend (TLGS) insulin pump delivery in 
pre-pubertal children with type 1 diabetes in supervised hotel conditions. The 
patients [n = 24, age range: 7-12, HbA1c: 7.5 ± 0.5% (58 ± 5 mmol/mol)] and 
their parents were admitted twice at a 3-week interval. CL control to range or 
TLGS set at 3.9 mmoL/L were assessed for 48 hour in randomized order. Admissions 
included three meals and one snack, and physical exercise. Meal boluses followed 
individual insulin/carb ratios. While overnight (22:00-08:00) per cent 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time below 3.9 mmol/L (primary outcome) was 
similar, time in ranges 3.9 to 10.0 and 3.9 to 7.8 mmoL/L and mean CGM were all 
significantly improved with CL (P < 0.001). These results were confirmed over 
the whole 48 hour. Disconnections between devices and limited accuracy of 
glucose sensors in the hypoglycaemic range appeared as limiting factors for 
optimal control. CL mode was well accepted while fear of hypoglycaemia was 
unchanged. CL did not minimize nocturnal hypoglycaemia exposure but improved 
time in target range compared to TLGS. Although safe and well-accepted, CL 
systems would benefit from more integrated devices.

AIMS: Recent studies report that approximately 50% of patients with type 1 
diabetes (T1D) are overweight or obese. This work studies the effects of 
intensive multidisciplinary weight management (IMWM) in patients with T1D and 
obesity.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 68 patients with T1D and obesity who 
enrolled in a 12-week IMWM program (IMWM cohort: mean age, 42 ± 11 years; HbA1c, 
8.3% ± 1.0%; body weight, 104.3 ± 18.2 kg; BMI, 36.2 ± 4.9 kg/m2 ). We matched 
them 1:1 with a similar cohort of patients receiving standard care (SC cohort: 
mean age, 42 ± 12 years; HbA1c, 8.3% ± 1.0%; body weight, 102.4 ± 17.9 kg; BMI, 
36.1 ± 4.7 kg/m2 ). Data were collected at baseline and at 12 months.
RESULTS: Participants in the IMWM cohort had a body weight change of -6.6 ± 1.8 
kg or -6.4% ± 1.6% of their initial body weight, while participants in the SC 
cohort had no change (P < 0.01 for group*time interaction). Participants in the 
IMWM cohort had a change in HbA1c of -0.4% ± 0.1% from baseline (P < 0.01), 
while participants in the SC cohort had no change. There was no difference in 
glycaemic control between cohorts at 12 months. Total daily insulin dose changed 
by -5.9 ± 1.8 units/d from baseline in the IMWM cohort while there was no change 
in the SC cohort (P < 0.01 for group*time interaction).
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to standard care, patients with T1D and obesity who 
participated in an IMWM programme achieved significant weight loss and 
significant reduction in daily insulin dose at 1 year. Weight reduction was 
associated with improvements in glycaemic control compared to baseline.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare, chronic, heterogeneous, papulosquamous 
inflammatory dermatosis of unknown etiology. Although erythematous scaly patches 
characterize the classic presentation of PRP, a broad range of clinical 
presentations has been reported. Histologically, PRP is characterized by 
psoriasiform acanthosis with alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis and 
rarely small acantholytic foci. In this article, we report a patient who 
presented with diffuse erythroderma and extensive acantholysis mimicking 
pemphigus vulgaris histologically.

AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of retinopathy prevalence 
in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 22 Arab countries.
METHODS: We systematically searched 4 different literature databases (PubMed, 
Science Direct, Web of Science and Embase), from the date of inception until 
December 2017, to collect all the information about patients with T1D who 
developed retinopathy complications; for statistical analysis, we used MetaXL to 
evaluate the pooled prevalence estimate and the subgroup prevalence estimates 
employing double arcsine transformation and inverse variance heterogeneity 
models.
RESULTS: Our search strategy returned 475 studies, of which 39 met our inclusion 
criteria; of those, 16 were eligible for meta-analysis that were captured only 
in 15 Arab countries, through 45 years (1969-2014). The number of retinopathy 
patients was 396 out of 1,931 patients with T1D. The prevalence of retinopathy 
was 19% (95% CI 10-28%). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (Q 240.78, p < 
0.0001, I2 93.77%, 95% CI 91.35-95.52%); however, no single study considerably 
affected the overall pooled prevalence estimate.
CONCLUSION: Almost one fifth of T1D patients in 15 Arab countries have diabetic 
retinopathy, therefore it is important to improve the care of patients with T1D 
and in Arab countries to avoid the development of such a devastating 
complication.

Challenges in Orphan Drug Development: Identification of Effective Therapy for 
Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy.

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), the ocular manifestation of Graves' 
disease, is a process in which orbital connective tissues and extraocular 
muscles undergo inflammation and remodeling. The condition seems to result from 
autoimmune responses to antigens shared by the thyroid and orbit. The 
thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), expressed at low levels in orbital tissues, is a 
leading candidate antigen. Recent evidence suggests that another protein, the 
insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), is overexpressed in TAO, and 
antibodies against IGF-IR have been detected in patients with the disease. 
Furthermore, TSHR and IGF-IR form a physical and functional complex, and 
signaling initiated at TSHR requires IGF-IR activity. Identification of therapy 
for this rare disease has proven challenging and currently relies on nonspecific 
and inadequate agents, thus representing an important unmet need. A recently 
completed therapeutic trial suggests that inhibiting IGF-IR activity with a 
monoclonal antibody may be an effective and safe treatment for active TAO.

AIMS: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a seasonal influenza vaccine 
in a cohort of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving different 
immunomodulating/immunosuppressive therapies and assess predictors of immune 
response.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, non-randomized observational study 
including 108 patients receiving a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination was 
conducted. Influenza-specific antibody titers (H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B) were 
measured to evaluate rates of seroprotection and seroconversion/significant 
titer increase. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to 
identify prognostic factors of vaccination outcomes.
RESULTS: Regarding the whole cohort, seroprotection rates >70% were achieved for 
each influenza strain. Interferon-treated patients reached high seroprotection 
rates (>84%). Good seroprotection rates were seen in patients treated with 
glatiramer acetate. In particular for H3N2, response rates were low in 
natalizumab-treated patients and in the small subgroup of fingolimod-treated 
patients. Patients with a previous disease-modifying therapy and a longer 
disease duration were less likely to respond sufficiently. No severe adverse 
events were reported. MS disease activity was not increased after a one-year 
follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Vaccination led to good immunogenicity, especially in MS patients 
treated with interferons and glatiramer acetate. At least for the H1N1 strain, 
rates of seroprotection and seroconversion/significant titer increase were high 
(>70% and >60%, respectively) for all therapeutic subgroups. Patients with a 
longer duration of the disease are exposed to an increased risk of insufficient 
immune response to vaccination.

For individuals aged 10 to <40 years with type 1 diabetes and dyslipidaemia, US 
national guidelines recommend consideration of statin therapy based on age, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and other cardiovascular risk 
factors. We evaluated dyslipidaemia prevalence, statin therapy use, and 
associations between not meeting target LDL-C [<100 mg/dL (<5.55 mmol/L)] and 
other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in individuals aged 10 to <40 
years in the T1D Exchange clinic registry. In 7223 participants, statin use was 
2% in 10 to <18 year olds, 4% in 18 to <25 year olds, and 21% in 25 to <40 year 
olds. Individuals not on statin therapy with LDL-C above target were more likely 
to have ≥1 additional CVD risk factor(s) than those with LDL-C in the target 
range for all age groups (all P < 0.01). While most individuals not on statin 
therapy had LDL-C in the target range, those who did not were more likely to 
have ≥1 additional CVD risk factor(s), and therefore longitudinal study of lipid 
levels and statin use is needed to see if treatment of dyslipidaemia to target 
LDL-C levels may lower the risk of future CVD in individuals aged 10 to <40 
years with type 1 diabetes.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, and 
neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It is 
characterized by demyelination and neuronal loss that is induced by attack of 
autoreactive T cells to the myelin sheath and endogenous remyelination failure, 
eventually leading to functional neurological disability. Although recent 
evidence suggests that MS relapses are induced by environmental and exogenous 
triggers such as viral infections in a genetic background, its very complex 
pathogenesis is not completely understood. Therefore, the efficiency of current 
immunosuppression-based therapies of MS is too low, and emerging 
disease-modifying immunomodulatory agents such as fingolimod and dimethyl 
fumarate cannot stop progressive neurodegenerative process. Thus, the cell 
replacement therapy approach that aims to overcome neuronal cell loss and 
remyelination failure and to increase endogenous myelin repair capacity is 
considered as an alternative treatment option. A wide variety of preclinical 
studies, using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS, have 
recently shown that grafted cells with different origins including mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs), neural precursor and stem cells, and induced-pluripotent stem 
cells have the ability to repair CNS lesions and to recover functional 
neurological deficits. The results of ongoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
therapy studies, with the advantage of peripheral administration to the 
patients, have suggested that cell replacement therapy is also a feasible option 
for immunomodulatory treatment of MS. In this chapter, we overview cell sources 
and applications of the stem cell therapy for treatment of MS. We also discuss 
challenges including those associated with administration route, immune 
responses to grafted cells, integration of these cells to existing neural 
circuits, and risk of tumor growth. Finally, future prospects of stem cell 
therapy for MS are addressed.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient and public involvement in clinical practice 
guideline development is recommended to increase guideline trustworthiness and 
relevance. The aim was to engage multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and caregivers 
in the definition of the key questions to be answered in the European Academy of 
Neurology guideline on palliative care of people with severe MS.
METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used: an international online survey 
launched by the national MS societies of eight countries, after pilot 
testing/debriefing on 20 MS patients and 18 caregivers, focus group meetings of 
Italian and German MS patients and caregivers.
RESULTS: Of 1199 participants, 951 (79%) completed the whole online survey and 
934 from seven countries were analysed: 751 (80%) were MS patients (74% women, 
mean age 46.1) and 183 (20%) were caregivers (36% spouses/partners, 72% women, 
mean age 47.4). Participants agreed/strongly agreed on inclusion of the nine 
pre-specified topics (from 89% for 'advance care planning' to 98% for 
'multidisciplinary rehabilitation'), and <5% replied 'I prefer not to answer' to 
any topic. There were 569 free comments: 182 (32%) on the pre-specified topics, 
227 (40%) on additional topics (16 guideline-pertinent) and 160 (28%) on 
outcomes. Five focus group meetings (three of MS patients, two of caregivers, 
and overall 35 participants) corroborated the survey findings. In addition, they 
allowed an explanation of the guideline production process and the exploration 
of patient-important outcomes and of taxing issues.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple sclerosis patient and caregiver involvement was resource 
and time intensive, but rewarding. It was the key for the formulation of the 10 
guideline questions and for the identification of patient-important outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Although a role for CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of Sjögren's 
syndrome (SS) has been documented, the pathogenic significance of CD8+ T cells 
is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CD8+ T cells in 
the development of SS.
METHODS: Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analyses were utilized to detect 
T cell infiltration within the labial salivary glands of patients with primary 
SS. In parallel, p40-/- CD25-/- mice were used as a murine model of SS. In 
addition, mice with genetic knockout of CD4, CD8a, or interferon-γ (IFNγ) were 
crossed with p40-/- CD25-/- mice to study the pathogenic significance of 
specific lineage subpopulations, including functional salivary gland tests as 
well as histopathologic and serologic data. A CD8+ T cell-specific depletion 
antibody was used in this murine SS model to evaluate its potential as a 
therapeutic strategy.
RESULTS: CD8+ T cells with a tissue-resident memory phenotype outnumbered CD4+ T 
cells in the labial salivary glands of patients with SS, and were primarily 
colocalized with salivary duct epithelial cells and acinar cells. Furthermore, 
infiltrating CD8+ T cells with a CD69+CD103+/- tissue-resident phenotype and 
with a significant elevation of IFNγ production were dominant in the 
submandibular glands of mice in this murine SS model. CD8a knockout abrogated 
the development of SS in these mice. Knockout of IFNγ decreased CD8+ T cell 
infiltration and gland destruction. More importantly, depletion of CD8+ T cells 
fully protected mice against the pathologic manifestations of SS, even after the 
onset of disease.
CONCLUSION: These data reveal the pathogenic significance of CD8+ T cells in the 
development and progression of SS in the salivary glands. Treatment directed 
against CD8+ T cells may be a rational therapy for the management of SS in human 
subjects.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with nonspecific signs 
and symptoms that are also found in other conditions. This study aimed to 
evaluate manifestations at disease onset and to compare early SLE manifestations 
to those of diseases mimicking SLE.
METHODS: Academic lupus centers in Asia, Europe, North America, and South 
America collected baseline data on patients who were referred to them during the 
previous 3 years for possible SLE and who had a symptom duration of <1 year. 
Clinical and serologic manifestations were compared between patients diagnosed 
as having SLE and those diagnosed as having SLE-mimicking conditions. Diagnostic 
performance of the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) SLE 
classification criteria and the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating 
Clinics (SLICC) SLE classification criteria was tested.
RESULTS: Data were collected on 389 patients with early SLE and 227 patients 
with SLE-mimicking conditions. Unexplained fever was more common in early SLE 
than in SLE-mimicking conditions (34.5% versus 13.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). 
Features less common in early SLE included Raynaud's phenomenon (22.1% versus 
48.5%; P < 0.001), sicca symptoms (4.4% versus 34.4%; P < 0.001), dysphagia 
(0.3% versus 6.2%; P < 0.001), and fatigue (28.3% versus 37.0%; P = 0.024). 
Anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-β2 -glycoprotein I antibodies, positive Coombs' 
test results, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hypocomplementemia, and leukopenia 
were more common in early SLE than in SLE-mimicking conditions. Symptoms 
detailed in the ACR and SLICC classification criteria were significantly more 
frequent among those with early SLE. Fewer patients with early SLE were not 
identified as having early SLE with use of the SLICC criteria compared to the 
ACR criteria (16.5% versus 33.9%), but the ACR criteria demonstrated higher 
specificity than the SLICC criteria (91.6% versus 82.4%).
CONCLUSION: In this multicenter cohort, clinical manifestations that could help 
to distinguish early SLE from SLE-mimicking conditions were identified. These 
findings may aid in earlier SLE diagnosis and provide information for ongoing 
initiatives to revise SLE classification criteria.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are thought to play an important role in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but are also found in healthy donors (HDs). Previous 
studies examined variable region sequences of these autoantibodies at a time 
when knowledge of the human germline repertoire was incomplete. Here we 
collected and analyzed RF sequence data from the literature to elucidate how RFs 
develop and whether their characteristics differ between RA patients and HDs.
METHODS: A database was built containing nucleotide sequences of RF heavy and 
light chain variable domains and characteristics including affinity, isotype and 
specificity, all collected from published papers. Gene usage and mutation 
frequencies were analyzed using IMGT/HiV-QUEST. Selection strength was assessed 
with the BASELINe tool.
RESULTS: Sequences were retrieved for 183 RF clones (87 RA; 67 HDs; 29 other). 
No biased gene usage was observed for RA and HDs. However, there does appear to 
be skewed gene usage in RFs from patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia. Mutation 
frequency varies considerably between RFs, and isotype-switched clones have 
significantly more mutations. Monospecific RFs carry more mutations than 
polyspecific RFs; no difference was found for RA- versus HD-derived RFs. 
Overall, reported affinity is low (median 1 µM), with a non-significant trend 
toward higher affinity of RA-derived RFs. Mutation frequency and affinity did 
not appear to be correlated. BASELINe analysis suggests an overall lack of 
positive selection and less negative selection strength in RA-derived RFs.
CONCLUSIONS: RFs derived from RA patients have similar properties as those 
derived from HDs. The RF response can be characterized as a moderately matured 
autoantibody response, with variable levels of somatic hypermutation, but low 
affinity.

OBJECTIVES: Management of type 1 diabetes is often challenging. Smartphone 
mobile applications (apps) may provide additional support and help to improve 
glycemic control and clinical outcomes. The objectives of this study were to 
examine the literature evaluating the use of mobile apps (stand-alone and text 
messaging/feedback) in type 1 diabetes and to review top-rated mobile apps 
applicable to type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: Medline, Cochrane and Embase databases were systematically searched to 
identify studies published from inception to February 2018. Top-rated relevant 
apps from Google Play Store and Apple App Store were reviewed in July 2017.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 3,462 studies. Of these studies, 9 
evaluated the stand-alone apps; 3 showed significant improvement in glycated 
hemoglobin (A1C) levels (0.5%, p<0.05, 0.57%, p<0.05, and 0.58%, p=0.02); 3 
demonstrated improved adherence to glucose monitoring; and 1 study demonstrated 
a reduction in hypoglycemic events (glucose<3.0 mmol/L) in 6 of 10 participants 
who completed the study. Also, 5 studies evaluated a mobile app plus 
text-messaging/feedback system. Only 1 showed a significant reduction in severe 
hypoglycemic events (mobile app+text, IQR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.63; vs. 
control, IQR 2.29, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.91), while another single study demonstrated 
a reduction in median glycated hemoglobin levels (0.3%; p<0.001). Most top-rated 
mobile apps logged parameters relevant to diabetes management, and some provided 
graphic analysis and set reminders.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for larger and longer studies to 
explore the efficacy of apps to optimize outcomes in type 1 diabetes, the 
populations that would benefit most from these tools and the resources needed to 
support mobile apps plus text-messaging/feedback systems.

OBJECTIVE: Intensive self-monitoring of blood glucose levels by patients with 
diabetes achieves optimal glucose control, hence reducing the likelihood of 
complications.
METHODS: This is a prospective, cross-sectional study targeting adults with 
diabetes through community pharmacies and patient groups in Central and West 
London over a period of 10 weeks.
RESULTS: In all, 195 adults with diabetes were included in the analysis of the 
results. When monitoring adherence was examined, 43.4% (n=33/76) of participants 
with type 1 diabetes reported that their health care professionals had asked 
them to monitor their blood glucose levels between 3 and 4 times per day; 
however, 10% of this group was not following their health-care professionals' 
directions. Participants with type 2 diabetes were asked the same question; 
42.9% (n=51/119) were asked to monitor their blood glucose between 3 and 4 times 
a day, but only 2.5% (n=3/119) were following their health-care professionals' 
directions. When questioned about their reasons for poor adherence, the cohort 
indicated that it was due to the painful (29.2%, n=57/195), uncomfortable 
(33.8%, n=66/195) or inconvenient (36.9%, n=72/195) nature of testing. In 
addition, 75.3% (n=147/195) of the participants expressed their desire for a 
noninvasive monitoring device, and 74.3% (n=145/195) said they would be 
satisfied to use one of the preselected advanced technologies to monitor their 
blood glucose levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The favoured advanced technology, selected by 49.7% (n=97/195) of 
participants, was the wristband. Statistical significance was seen between the 
type of diabetes and the device selected; patients with type 1 diabetes 
preferred contact lenses (p<0.05) and tattoos (p<0.0001), whereas participants 
with type 2 diabetes preferred earlobe sensors (p<0.0001) and saliva analyzers 
(p<0.0001). Participants' gender, age and ethnicity also influenced device 
selection.

OBJECTIVES: Copeptin, a surrogate marker for vasopressin, is elevated in 
participants with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. Whereas adults 
with type 1 diabetes also demonstrate elevated copeptin concentrations and IR 
compared to controls without diabetes, the relationship between copeptin and IR 
in type 1 diabetes is unclear.
METHODS: Participants with (n=209) and without (n=244) type 1 diabetes in the 
Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study were assessed for 
serum copeptin, vitals, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio, glycated hemoglobin and lipid panels. Estimated 
insulin sensitivity (eIS) was calculated by validated equations in participants 
with and without type 1 diabetes. The relationships among copeptin, IR, waist 
circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) were examined with unadjusted and 
adjusted linear regression models.
RESULTS: Copeptin was correlated with eIS (R=-0.17, R2=0.029), WC (R=0.16, 
R2=0.026) and BMI (R=0.22, R2=0.048) for type 1 diabetes and with eIS (R=-0.37, 
R2=0.14), WC (R=0.40, R2=0.16) and BMI (R=0.25, R2=0.063) in non-type 1 
diabetes. In multivariable analysis, copeptin correlated with total cholesterol 
(beta±SE: -0.12±0.04, p=0.008) and low-density lipoprotein (beta±SE: -0.11±0.04, 
p=0.01) in type 1 diabetes. In non-type 1 diabetes, copeptin was associated with 
WC (beta±SE: 0.14±0.04, p=0.0024), BMI (beta±SE: 0.13±0.04, p=0.007) and eIS 
(beta±SE: -0.14±0.04, p=0.0013).
CONCLUSIONS: Copeptin does not correlate with markers of IR in type 1 diabetes 
but strongly correlates in non-type 1 diabetes. Thus, elevated vasopressin 
activity and IR appear to be independent risk factors for vascular complications 
in type 1 diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the factors associated with fatigue focusing on 
comorbidities in a large cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses were performed on RA patients from the French 
COMEDRA cohort study, a nurse-led program for comorbidities management. Fatigue 
was assessed using Question 3 of the Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease 
(RAID) score on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS). Fatigue was defined as 
acceptable if ≤ 2, moderate if 3 or 4, or severe if ≥ 5 out of 10. Using 
univariate and multivariate models, the relationship between fatigue and 
demographics, social, disease characteristics, comorbidities (cardiovascular, 
infections, cancer, pulmonary, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders), 
physical activity, quality of life, and treatments was investigated.
RESULTS: In total, 962 patients were analyzed. The mean fatigue score was 
3.8 ± 2.7, 40% of patients reported severe fatigue. Patients had an average of 
1.8 additional morbid conditions, with anxiety/depression the most common (52%). 
In univariate analysis, severe fatigue was more frequent in women, in patients 
not working, and in those with less physical activity. It was associated with 
disease duration and activity, mHAQ, pain, sleeping and emotional difficulties. 
Severe fatigue correlated with Multimorbidity index assessing the number of 
morbid conditions and was associated with obesity, hypertension, COPD, and 
anxiety/depression. In multivariate models, the risk of severe fatigue was 
associated with female gender, disease activity, mHAQ, current treatment with 
NSAIDs and biologics, multimorbidity, obesity and anxiety/depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of comorbidities, psychological health and physical 
activity should be taken into account in order to address frequent RA-related 
severe fatigue.

and neuropathological study.

Alpers' syndrome is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder often caused by 
biallelic pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of 
polymerase-gamma (POLG) which is essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
replication. Alpers' syndrome is characterized by intractable epilepsy, 
developmental regression and liver failure which typically affects children aged 
6 months-3 years. Although later onset variants are now recognized, they differ 
in that they are primarily an epileptic encephalopathy with ataxia. The disorder 
is progressive, without cure and inevitably leads to death from drug-resistant 
status epilepticus, often with concomitant liver failure. Since our 
understanding of the mechanisms contributing the neurological features in 
Alpers' syndrome is rudimentary, we performed a detailed and quantitative 
neuropathological study on 13 patients with clinically and 
histologically-defined Alpers' syndrome with ages ranging from 2 months to 18 
years. Quantitative immunofluorescence showed severe respiratory chain 
deficiencies involving mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits of complex I 
and, to a lesser extent, complex IV in inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal 
neurons in the occipital cortex and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. 
Diminished densities of these neuronal populations were also observed. This 
study represents the largest cohort of post-mortem brains from patients with 
clinically defined Alpers' syndrome where we provide quantitative evidence of 
extensive complex I defects affecting interneurons and Purkinje cells for the 
first time. We believe interneuron and Purkinje cell pathology underpins the 
clinical development of seizures and ataxia seen in Alpers' syndrome. This study 
also further highlights the extensive involvement of GABAergic neurons in 
mitochondrial disease.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is a widespread autoimmune disease and 
inflammation and bone destruction are two main issues in rheumatoid arthritis.
OBJECTIVE: To discussing metformin effects on rheumatoid arthritis 
complications.
METHODS: We conducted a narrative literature search including clinical trials, 
experimental studies on laboratory animals and cell lines. Our search covered 
Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar databases from 1999 until 2018. We used the 
terms" Metformin; Rheumatoid arthritis; Cardiovascular disease; Cancer; 
Osteoblastogenesis.
DISCUSSION: Inflammatory pro-cytokines such as Interlukin-6 play important roles 
in T. helper 17 cell lineage differentiation. Interlukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis 
Factor-α activate Janus kinase receptors signal through signaling transducer and 
activator of transcription signaling pathway which plays important role in 
inflammation, bone destruction and cancer in rheumatoid arthritis patients. 
Interlukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α synergistically activate signaling 
transducer and activator of transcription and Nuclear Factor-kβ pathways and 
both cytokines increase the chance of cancer development in rheumatoid arthritis 
patients. Metformin is AMPK activators that can suppress mTOR, STAT3 and HIF-1 
so AMPK activation plays important role in suppressing inflammation and 
osteoclastogenesis and decreasing cancer.
CONCLUSION: Metformin effect on AMPK and mTOR pathways gives the capability to 
change Treg/Th17 balance and decrease Th17 differentiation and inflammation, 
osteoclastogenesis and cancers in RA patients. Metformin can be useful in 
protecting bones especially in first stages of RA and it can decrease 
inflammation, CVD and cancer in RA patients so Metformin beside DAMARs can be 
useful in increasing RA patients' life quality with less harm and cost.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine alterations in axonal 
excitability in tibial nerve as compared with median nerve axonal excitability 
in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy.
METHODS: Six patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and 10 patients with diabetes 
mellitus without polyneuropathy were enrolled.
RESULTS: Compared with diabetic patients without polyneuropathy, the tibial 
nerve strength-duration time constant was significantly longer and 
supernormality was lower in those with polyneuropathy. Threshold electrotonus 
studies showed abnormalities in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy, in which 
smaller threshold changes from long-depolarizing and hyperpolarizing 
conditioning, termed "fanning-in," were found.
DISCUSSION: This study confirms that axonal excitability is significantly 
altered in the tibial nerve of patients with diabetic polyneuropathy. Evaluating 
the axonal excitability of the median and tibial nerves may reveal the presence 
of length-dependent polyneuropathy at an early stage. Muscle Nerve 59:76-81,

The advent of magnetic resonance imaging has improved our understanding of the 
pathophysiology and natural course of multiple sclerosis (MS). The ability of 
magnetic resonance imaging to show the evolution of MS lesions on sequential 
scans has brought it to be one of the endpoints in clinical trials for 
disease-modifying therapies. Based on the most updated consensus guidelines from 
the American (Consortium of MS Centers) and European (Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
in MS) boards of experts in MS, this document shows the most relevant landmarks 
related to imaging findings, diagnostic criteria, indications to obtain a 
magnetic resonance, scan protocols and sequence options for patients with MS. 
Although incorporating the knowledge derived from the research arena into the 
daily clinical practice is always challenging, in this article, the authors 
provide useful recommendations to improve the information contained in the 
magnetic resonance report oriented to facilitate communication between 
radiologists and specialized medical teams involved in MS patients' 
multidisciplinary care.

OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoinflammatory disease caused by 
genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers, which include infectious 
agents. Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that frequently colonizes the stomach, 
is associated with the development of certain autoinflammatory disorders. This 
study examined a possible association between H. pylori infection and RA.
METHOD: This cohort study was performed in the Central Denmark Region. Patients 
were enrolled from primary healthcare centres after a urea breath test (UBT) for 
H. pylori and followed for a median of 8 years. Nationwide administrative 
registries provided information about the patients' diagnoses, country of birth, 
and gender. Comorbidity was determined using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. We 
compared the prevalence of RA via odds ratios (ORs) and incidences using Cox 
regression to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) by comparing H. pylori-positive 
and H. pylori-negative individuals and adjusting for confounding variables.
RESULTS: A total of 56 000 people diagnosed as H. pylori positive or negative 
had similar rates of comorbidity. No link was found between H. pylori and RA. 
There was no difference in RA prevalence until time of UBT [OR = 0.91, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.19)] or incidence of new RA cases after UBT 
(HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.56-1.13) between H. pylori-positive and -negative subjects. 
Validation via four other RA definitions provided similar results.
CONCLUSION: This study found no association between H. pylori infection and RA. 
This result does not support the involvement of H. pylori in a gut-joint axis of 
importance for RA development.

The immune system is a major contributor to brain homeostasis and pathogenesis 
of neurological diseases. However, the role of B lymphocytes (cells) in the 
brain is poorly understood. In this review, we describe the functions of the 
different subtypes of B cells in brain development and neurological diseases. B 
cells are classified into several subtypes according their function and gene 
expression. B-1a cells, which participate in innate immunity by producing 
natural antibodies, are abundant in the developing brain, and mediate 
oligodendrocyte development. In conditions such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis, 
spinal cord injury, and stroke, B-2 cells exacerbate the pathology by producing 
pathogenic autoantibodies. On the other hand, regulatory B cells suppress 
inflammation by secreting interleukin-10 and play beneficial roles in 
pathological conditions. Here, we summarize the distribution and function of B 
cells during brain development and neurological diseases.

BACKGROUND: Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) is an unexpected death caused by heart 
dysfunction. Autoantibodies against cardiac proteins may be potentially involved 
in the occurrence and progression of cardiac disease and SCD. The first report 
on the role of autoantibodies in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy appeared in 
the 1980s. In recent years new studies on the effects of the presence of 
specific autoantibodies and their relationship to ventricular arrhythmias and 
SCD were published. The purpose of the current mini-review is to analyze the 
results of the research studies focused on the relationship between 
anti-cardiomyocyte autoantibodies and SCD with respect to autoimmune disorders.
CONCLUSION: According to our analysis, more research is needed to understand the 
role of these autoantibodies against cardiac proteins in the SCD pathogenesis, 
and potentially employ this knowledge for improving prognosis of SCD.

Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in the Adult, LADA has been investigated less than 
"classical" type 1 and type 2 diabetes and the criteria for and the relevance of 
a LADA diagnosis has been challenged. Despite the absence of a genetic 
background that is exclusive to LADA, this form of diabetes displays phenotypic 
characteristics that distinguish it from other forms of diabetes. LADA is 
heterogeneous in terms of the impact of autoimmunity and lifestyle factors, 
something that poses problems as to therapy and follow-up perhaps particularly 
in those with marginal positivity. Yet, there appears to be clear clinical 
utility in classifying individuals as LADA.

Environmental (Lifestyle) Risk Factors for LADA.

Carlsson S(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: In order to prevent diabetes it is important to identify common, 
modifiable risk factors in the population. Such knowledge is extensive for type 
2 diabetes but limited for autoimmune forms of diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims at summarizing the limited literature on potential 
environmental (lifestyle) risk factors for LADA.
METHODS: A PubMed search identified 15 papers estimating the risk of LADA in 
relation to lifestyle. These were based on data from two population-based 
studies; one Swedish case-control study and one Norwegian cohort study.
RESULTS: Studies published to date indicate that the risk of LADA is associated 
with factors promoting insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes such as 
overweight, physical inactivity, smoking, low birth weight, sweetened beverage 
intake and moderate alcohol consumption (protective). Findings also indicate 
potential effects on autoimmunity exerted by intake of coffee (harmful) and 
fatty fish (protective). This supports the concept of LADA as being a hybrid 
form of diabetes with an etiology including factors associated with both insulin 
resistance and autoimmunity.
CONCLUSION: LADA may in part be preventable through the same lifestyle 
modifications as type 2 diabetes including weight loss, physical activity and 
smoking cessation. However, current knowledge is hampered by the small number of 
studies and the fact that they exclusively are based on Scandinavian 
populations. There is a great need for additional studies exploring the role of 
lifestyle factors in the development of LADA.

Treatment of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults: What is Best?

Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA), although formally classified as 
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), very often (at least in Western countries) appear 
clinically with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)-like features as overweight and insulin 
resistance. LADA patients do not need exogenous insulin at the time they are 
diagnosed with diabetes, but a large percentage will within a few years develop 
need for such treatment. The decline in beta cell function progresses much 
faster in LADA than in T2D, presumably because of the ongoing autoimmune assault 
in LADA, and therefore necessitates insulin therapy much earlier in LADA than in 
T2D. Despite high prevalence of LADA (about 10% of the total diabetic population 
in many countries), the treatment of LADA patients is far less elucidated than 
is the case for T1D and T2D. Finding a treatment strategy for LADA from the time 
of diagnosis, that can reduce the decline of beta cell function, ensure adequate 
metabolic control and thereby reduce the risk of diabetic complications is thus 
an important clinical challenge. Conclusions from the randomized treatment 
studies so far do not indicate an optimal treatment strategy in LADA. This 
review aims to give an overview of current practices for the medical treatment 
of LADA as well as an update on results from recent studies on the treatment of 
the disease.

Cardiovascular (CV) risk in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is increased. In 
this study, we evaluated the differences in major markers of CV risk between 
patients with T1DM and healthy controls by a systematic review and 
meta-analysis. Literature from PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library 
comparing CV risk markers between patients with T1DM and controls was obtained. 
The overall standard mean differences (SMDs) of carotid intima-media thickness 
(cIMT), endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD%), carotid-femoral 
pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), and glyceryl trinitrate-mediated dilatation (GTN%) 
with its 95% confidence interval (CI) between patients with T1DM and control 
groups were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effect model. Heterogeneity 
was evaluated using the Cochran Q and I2 statistics. The results showed that 
patients with T1DM had a significantly greater cIMT (SMD: 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.69-1.09; P < .001), significantly lower FMD% (SMD: -1.45%; 95% CI, -1.74 to 
-1.17; P < .001), significantly increased cf-PWV (SMD: 0.57; 95% CI, 0.03-1.11; 
P < .001), and significantly decreased GTN% (SMD: -1.11; 95% CI, -1.55 to -0.66; 
P < .001) than controls. Our results support the current evidence for an 
elevated CV burden in patients with T1DM and affirm the clinical utility of 
markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in the management of these patients.

OBJECTIVE: The production of class-switched high-affinity autoantibodies derived 
from organized germinal centers (GCs) is a hallmark of many autoimmune 
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TANK-binding kinase 
1 (TBK-1) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the maturation of GC 
follicular helper T (Tfh) cells downstream of inducible costimulator signaling. 
We undertook this study to assess the therapeutic potential of TBK-1 inhibition 
using the small-molecule inhibitor WEHI-112 in antibody-dependent models of 
inflammatory arthritis.
METHODS: Using the models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), antigen-induced 
arthritis (AIA), and K/BxN serum-transfer-induced arthritis (STIA), we 
determined the effectiveness of WEHI-112 at inhibiting clinical and histologic 
features of arthritis in C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice. We used immunohistochemistry to 
characterize GC populations during CIA development, and we used enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays to determine levels of Ig autoantibodies in 
WEHI-112-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice.
RESULTS: WEHI-112, a tool compound that is semiselective for TBK-1 but that also 
has activity against IKKε and JAK2, abolished TBK-1-dependent activation of 
interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 and inhibited type I IFN responses in 
vitro. In vivo, treatment with WEHI-112 selectively abrogated clinical and 
histologic features of established, antibody-dependent CIA, but had minimal 
effects on an antibody-independent model of AIA or on K/BxN STIA. In keeping 
with these findings, WEHI-112 reduced arthritogenic type II collagen-specific 
IgG1 and IgG2b antibody production. Furthermore, WEHI-112 altered the GC Tfh 
cell phenotype and GC B cell function in CIA.
CONCLUSION: We report that TBK-1 inhibition using WEHI-112 abrogated 
antibody-dependent CIA. As WEHI-112 failed to inhibit non-antibody-driven joint 
inflammation, we conclude that the major effect of this compound was most likely 
the targeting of TBK-1-mediated mechanisms in the GC reaction. This approach may 
have therapeutic potential in RA and in other GC-associated autoantibody-driven 
inflammatory diseases.

Comment in
    J Rheumatol. 2019 Feb;46(2):127-129.

OBJECTIVE: Polysymptomatic distress (PSD) is the underlying metric of 
fibromyalgia (FM), and levels of PSD can identify criteria-positive FM with > 
90% accuracy. We used levels of the PSD scale to test whether symptom levels in 
primary FM (PFM) and secondary FM (SFM) were the same and whether symptoms were 
equivalent in persons not meeting FM criteria.
METHODS: We studied 1525 patients with a clinical diagnosis of FM and 12,037 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We used regression models to compare 
patients with potential and actual PFM to RA patients with potential and actual 
SFM for 17 key clinical variables.
RESULTS: When controlled for PSD values, the widespread pain index, symptom 
severity scale, and pain, global, quality of life, and physical and mental 
component scores were essentially the same or only slightly different in PFM and 
SFM. Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index scores were slightly 
higher in SFM (0.21 units), as was the painful joint count (1.6 joints). 
Overall, higher PSD scores were associated with more severe symptoms or abnormal 
status. PSD scores in patients not satisfying FM criteria and in patients 
satisfying criteria operated similarly.
CONCLUSION: PFM and SFM are equivalent regarding symptom burden. PSD scores are 
more informative about severity and severity within diagnosis than 
dichotomization into FM/non-FM. Studies of FM versus "healthy individuals," or 
FM versus other diseases, are inherently defective, while studies of FM and PSD 
in RA offer the opportunity to have meaningful comparison groups, because there 
are no readily available unbiased appropriate controls for PFM.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of preconceptional cardiovascular (CV) 
health, measured by American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, on pregnancy 
outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: The study included patients in the Hopkins Lupus Pregnancy Cohort. Body 
mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, and blood pressure (BP) in the most recent 
clinic visit prior to conception or first trimester were used to determine CV 
health (ideal, intermediate, or poor health) based on AHA definitions. Outcomes 
included preterm birth, gestational age at birth, and small for gestational age 
(SGA). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models with generalized 
estimating equations estimated the association of each CV health factor and 
outcome.
RESULTS: The analysis included 309 live births. There were 95 preterm births 
(31%), and of the 293 pregnancies with birth weights, 18% were SGA. Ideal BMI, 
total cholesterol, and BP were reported in 56%, 85%, and 51% of pregnancies, 
respectively. Intermediate BMI was associated with decreased odds of SGA (OR 
0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.63), adjusted for race and prednisone use. Intermediate/poor 
total cholesterol was associated with increased odds of preterm birth (OR 2.21, 
95% CI 1.06-4.62). Intermediate/poor BP was associated with decreased 
gestational age at birth (β -0.96, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.29).
CONCLUSION: Poor/intermediate preconception CV health affects pregnancy outcomes 
of preterm birth and SGA infants among women with SLE. Efforts to maintain BMI, 
total cholesterol, and BP within the recommended ideal range prior to pregnancy 
is important to improve pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE.

OBJECTIVE: We analysed the correlation between magnetic resonance images of the 
parotid and submandibular glands and the salivary flow rate in patients with 
Sjögren's syndrome.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed magnetic resonance images (heterogeneous 
signal-intensity distribution and gland volume on T1- and fat-suppressed 
T2-weighted images, and multiple high-signal-intensity spots on magnetic 
resonance sialograms in the parotid and submandibular glands) obtained from 66 
patients who were diagnosed with Sjögren's syndrome. We evaluated the 
relationship between these imaging features and their salivary flow rates in 
stimulated and unstimulated conditions.
RESULTS: We found that as the disease progressed, both the heterogeneous 
signal-intensity distribution and the volumes of the parotid and the 
submandibular glands were significantly related to the stimulated and the 
unstimulated salivary flow rate. These imaging features were more highly 
correlated in assessments of the submandibular gland than in those of the 
parotid gland for both stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance image features of heterogeneity and smaller 
volume in the submandibular gland are reliable for predicting hyposalivation 
related to the progression of Sjögren's syndrome.

We aimed to estimate the frequency of overlap of antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) with systemic autoimmune diseases. 
Retrospective single-center study to identify patients with AAV diagnosis and 
concomitant autoimmune systemic diseases, simultaneously, before or after the 
diagnosis of AAV. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as comorbidities; 
follow-up time; type of AAV; disease duration; relapses; treatment and response; 
clinical, serological, and histological characteristics; disease activity and 
damage; prognosis; dialysis requirements, and death were assessed. Twenty-eight 
of two hundred and forty-seven patients (11.3%) with AAV had a concomitant 
diagnosis of autoimmune disease. The predominant AAV type was renal-limited 
vasculitis (39%), followed by granulomatosis with polyangiitis (29%), 
mycroscopic polyangiitis (25%), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (7%). Mean age at AAV diagnosis was 50 ± 17 years and 24/28 were 
ANCA positive. The main clinical manifestations were renal (79%), 
otorhinolaryngologic (43%), and pulmonary and peripheral neuropathy (32%). 
Sixteen patients (57%) experienced partial or total remission at a median 
follow-up of 34 months, and four patients (14%) died. The most frequent 
autoimmune disease overlapped was rheumatoid arthritis (39%), followed by 
Sjögren's syndrome and systemic sclerosis (14%), mixed connective tissue disease 
(11%), systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (7%), and 
ankylosing spondylitis and IgG4-related disease (4%). In nine patients (32%), 
both diagnoses were simultaneous; in the rest, median time elapsed between the 
autoimmune disease and AAV diagnosis was 173 months. The prevalence of overlap 
AAV with other autoimmune diseases was low. The most common AAV phenotype was 
renal-limited vasculitis, and the most frequent overlap disease was rheumatoid 
arthritis.

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness. We 
systematically reviewed studies published from Jan 1, 1980, to Jan 7, 2018, 
assessed the methodological quality, and described variations in incidence of 
diabetic retinopathy by region with a focus on population-based studies that 
were conducted after 2000 (n=8, including two unpublished studies). Of these 
eight studies, five were from Asia, and one each from the North America, 
Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. The annual incidence of diabetic retinopathy 
ranged from 2·2% to 12·7% and progression from 3·4% to 12·3%. Progression to 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy was higher in individuals with mild disease 
compared with those with no disease at baseline. Our Review suggests that more 
high-quality population-based studies capturing data on the incidence and 
progression of diabetic retinopathy with stratification by age and sex are 
needed to consolidate the evidence base. Our data is useful for 
conceptualisation and development of major public health strategies such as 
screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy.

Several studies confirmed the association of HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 alleles with 
altered risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, data from individual studies 
based on small sample sizes yielded often conflicting findings in African Arabs. 
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at comprehensively 
evaluating this association with T1D, using molecular HLA data. Relevant studies 
were identified through systemic search of Medline/PubMed, Cochrane, Science 
Direct, ResearchGate, and EMBASE databases. Statistical analysis was carried out 
using RevMan, and Comprehensive Meta-analysis programs. Given the heterogeneity 
of African Arabs, we also performed subgroup analysis according to ethnicity. 
Analysis of sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias were performed to 
validate the outcome of the findings. This meta-analysis included 862 T1DM 
cases, along with 1,390 normoglycemic control, and comprised ten comparisons. 
Our study indicates that DRB1*03 (OR = 2.86), DRB1*04 (OR = 2.78), and DQB1*02 
(OR = 2.29), are positively associated with increased risk of T1DM, while 
DRB1*07 (OR = 0.48), DRB1*11 (OR = 0.20), DRB1*13 (OR = 0.47), DRB1*15 
(OR = 0.30), DQB1*05 (OR = 0.39), and DQB1*06 (OR = 0.27) were negatively 
associated with T1D, suggesting a protective role against T1D. This 
meta-analysis was characterized by low heterogeneity, sensitivity, and 
publication bias, indicating the robustness and reliability of the results.

BACKGROUND: Adequate testing of delivery accuracy of insulin pumps is under 
discussion. Especially for patch pumps, test settings are challenging. In 
addition, evaluation and presentation of accuracy results in a way that is 
reasonable and useful for clinicians, not only for technicians, is important.
METHODS: Test setups based on IEC 60601-2-24 were used and, in addition, 
different setups for patch pumps were compared to identify an adequate 
alternative for pumps without external infusion set. These setups are applicable 
for both bolus and basal rate accuracy testing. In addition, evaluation 
procedures considering clinical relevance were compiled.
RESULTS: A setup for patch pumps that provides reliable results could be 
realized. Evaluation of basal rate accuracy data should also consider the actual 
clinical use of insulin pumps and thus, deviating from IEC 60601-2-24, compose 
the whole measurement period without excluding the first 24 hours. In addition 
to the presentation using trumpet curves, accuracy of 1-hour windows should be 
evaluated and displayed.
CONCLUSIONS: This article proposes an approach on how to test, evaluate, and 
present bolus and basal rate accuracy of insulin pumps from a clinical 
perspective.

ADAM15 in Apoptosis Resistance of Synovial Fibroblasts: Converting Fas/CD95 
Death Signals Into the Activation of Prosurvival Pathways by Calmodulin 
Recruitment.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate mechanisms underlying the capability of ADAM15 to 
transform FasL-mediated death-inducing signals into prosurvival activation of 
Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts 
(RASFs).
METHODS: Caspase 3/7 activity and apoptosis rate were determined in RASFs and 
ADAM15-transfected T/C28a4 cells upon Fas/CD95 triggering using enzyme assays 
and annexin V staining. Phosphorylated Src and FAK were analyzed by 
immunoblotting. Interactions of ADAM15 and CD95 with calmodulin (CaM), Src, or 
FAK were analyzed by pull-downs using CaM-Sepharose and coimmunoprecipitations 
with specific antibodies. Protein binding assays were performed using 
recombinant CaM and ADAM15. Immunofluorescence was performed to investigate 
subcellular colocalization of ADAM15, Fas/CD95, and CaM.
RESULTS: The antiapoptotic effect of ADAM15 in FasL-stimulated cells was 
demonstrated either by increased apoptosis of cells transfected with an ADAM15 
construct lacking the cytoplasmic domain compared to cells transfected with 
full-length ADAM15 or by reduced apoptosis resistance of RASFs upon RNA 
interference silencing of ADAM15. Fas ligation triggered a Ca2+ 
 release-activated Ca2+ /calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 
(CRAC/Orai1) channel-dependent CaM recruitment to Fas/CD95 and ADAM15 in the 
cell membrane. Simultaneously, Src associated with CaM was shown to become 
engaged in the ADAM15 complex also containing cytoplasmic-bound FAK. 
Accordingly, Fas ligation in RASFs led to ADAM15-dependent phosphorylation of 
Src and FAK, which was associated with increased survival. Pharmacologic 
interference with either the CaM inhibitor trifluoperazine or the CRAC/Orai 
inhibitor BTP-2 simultaneously applied with FasL synergistically enhanced 
Fas-mediated apoptosis in RASFs.
CONCLUSION: ADAM15 provides a scaffold for formation of CaM-dependent 
prosurvival signaling complexes upon CRAC/Orai coactivation by FasL-induced 
death signals and a potential therapeutic target to break apoptosis resistance 
in RASFs.

OBJECTIVE: The Japan Research Committee for Intractable Vasculitis has fully 
revised the clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) to improve and 
standardize the medical treatment of the disease in Japan.
METHODS: The previous CPG was published in a classical review style in Japanese 
in 2011 and 2014. We adopted the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation system for this revision, and various stakeholders, 
including patients, participated in it. The expected users of this CPG are AAV 
patients in Japan and their families and healthcare professionals, including 
both AAV specialists and non-specialists. We set clinical questions concerning 
the three important clinical topics of remission induction therapy, plasma 
exchange, remission maintenance therapy, and developed eight recommendation 
statements.
RESULTS: For remission induction therapy for newly developed AAV, we weakly 
recommend glucocorticoid (GC) plus intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse (IVCY) or 
oral cyclophosphamide (POCY) rather than GC alone, and IVCY rather than POCY. We 
also weakly recommend CY rather than rituximab. In the case of AAV with severe 
renal impairment, we weakly recommend plasma exchange as a conjunction therapy. 
We weakly recommend azathioprine for remission maintenance therapy.
CONCLUSION: The revised CPG has demonstrated evidence-based treatment 
recommendations for AAV.

OBJECTIVES: Body mass index (BMI) might affect rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
outcomes. Clinical assessment of swollen joint count (SJC) might also be 
affected by obesity in terms of obesity-related excess adipose tissue. In this 
study, we compared ultrasonography (US) and clinical examination in assessing 
the effect of BMI on RA disease activity assessment.
METHODS: This was a single-centre study including RA (ACR/EULAR criteria) 
patients. US assessment was performed by one trained rheumatologist blinded to 
clinical data. US synovitis was defined as grey-scale score ≥2 and/or power 
Doppler score ≥1. The primary outcome measure was difference in SJC (ΔSJC) 
between clinical and US assessment (US-clinical examination). The secondary 
outcome was to evaluate the difference between clinical and US assessment of the 
Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (ΔDAS28) in the 3 BMI subgroups according to 
the WHO classification.
RESULTS: We included 76 RA patients (mean age 53.8 ± 11.8 years; 67% female). 
Overall, 28 (36.8%), 33 (43.4%) and 15 (19.7%) were normal weight, overweight 
and obese, respectively. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the 3 
BMI subgroups. US-determined SJC was significantly higher than 
clinical-determined SJC for overweight and obese RA patients: p=0.001 and 
p=0.049, respectively. The DAS28 was higher with US than clinical examination 
within the overweight group only (p=0.002). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
revealed a significant difference between ΔDAS28 among the 3 BMI subgroups 
(p=0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: In high BMI RA patients both SJC and DAS28 seem to be undervalued 
by clinical assessment when compared to US.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate short-term costs associated with non-medical switch 
(NMS) from originator biologics to biosimilars among stable patients with 
autoimmune conditions in rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology from a 
US provider's and third-party payer's perspective.
METHODS: An economic model was constructed to estimate switching costs related 
to physician time and healthcare resource utilisation (HRU) at the initial NMS 
visit and over 3 months. The proportion of patients with relevant conditions 
treated with originators and expected NMS rate, physician time, HRU, and payer 
reimbursement were derived from a physician survey. Switching costs were 
estimated for a practice of 1,000 patients with relevant conditions by 
therapeutic area and for an insurance plan with 1 million individuals by 
therapeutic area and all areas combined. Switching cost drivers were assessed 
with one-way sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Physicians expected extra 6 minutes for the NMS visit and 22 minutes 
over 3 months; NMS rates of 14.4%, 15.5%, and 17.7%; and 11.3%, 16.2%, and 33.2% 
of time not reimbursed for gastroenterology, rheumatology, and dermatology, 
respectively. The total switching costs for payer's were $771,460 (for n = 3,609 
patients with an NMS rate of 16.6%), mostly due to follow-up visits and 
additional laboratory tests/procedures. In sensitivity analyses, the NMS rate 
was the main cost driver. Increasing the NMS rate to 25% and 50% increased 
payer's total switching costs to $1.19 and $2.39 million, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Originator-to-biosimilar NMS in stable patients with autoimmune 
conditions could result in considerable switching costs for both providers and 
payers.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the value of serum miRNA for 
evaluating renal tissue activity in patients with class IV lupus nephritis (LN).
METHODS: First, we used a microRNA array to identify miRNAs differentially 
expressed between class IV LN patients and healthy volunteers (n=4/group). Then, 
we analysed the association between these identified miRNAs and renal tissue 
activity in class IV LN patients. Finally, to validate the results, 20 class IV 
LN patients (confirmed by renal biopsy) and 20 healthy control volunteers were 
further studied.
RESULTS: We found 23 miRNAs to be significantly differentially expressed between 
the 2 groups. We selected 5 of these miRNAs (miR-3165, miR-4762-5p, miR-146a-5p, 
miR-151a-3p, and miR-21-5p) for further experiments. In validation experiments, 
expression of miRNA-151a-3p was significantly down-regulated in the class IV LN 
group compared to that in the control group (p<0.01) and was negatively 
correlated with the activity index (AI) in the class IV LN group(r=-0.526, 
p=0.017); the internal correlation was described with a linear fitting equation 
(p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum miR-151a-3p expression was decreased in class IV LN patients 
compared with healthy control volunteers and was negatively correlated with 
renal tissue activity. Thus, miR-151a-3p may play a employed for diagnosing 
class IV LN and evaluating renal tissue activity.

OBJECTIVES: Microbial infections and mucosal dysbiosis influence morbidity in 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In the oral cavity, 
periodontal bacteria and subgingival plaque dysbiosis provide persistent 
inflammatory stimuli at the mucosal surface. This study was undertaken to 
evaluate whether exposure to periodontal bacteria influences disease parameters 
in SLE patients.
METHODS: Circulating antibodies to specific periodontal bacteria have been used 
as surrogate markers to determine an ongoing bacterial burden, or as indicators 
of past exposure to the bacteria. Banked serum samples from SLE patients in the 
Oklahoma Lupus Cohort were used to measure antibody titres against periodontal 
pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and 
Treponema denticola) and commensals (Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Streptococcus 
gordonii) by ELISA. Correlations between anti-bacterial antibodies and different 
clinicalparameters of SLE including, autoantibodies (anti-dsDNA, anti-SmRNP, 
anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La), complement, and disease activity (SLEDAI and 
BILAG) were studied.
RESULTS: SLE patients had varying amounts of antibodies to different oral 
bacteria. The antibody titres against A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, 
T. denticola, and C. ochracea were higher in patients positive for anti-dsDNA 
antibodies, and they showed significant correlations with anti-dsDNA titres and 
reduced levels of complement. Among the periodontal pathogens, only antibodies 
to A. actinomycetemcomitans were associated with higher disease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure to specific pathogenic 
periodontal bacteria influences disease activity in SLE patients. These findings 
provide a rationale for assessing and improving periodontal health in SLE 
patients, as an adjunct to lupus therapies.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 10-year clinical course of patients with 
seronegative arthritis with the emphasis of reclassification of diagnoses when 
applicable.
METHODS: A total of 1030 patients including 435 seronegative cases were 
classified as early RA in 1997-2005 at Jyväskylä Rheumatology Centre and 
prospectively scheduled for a ten-year follow-up. Clinical data from the 
follow-up visits and the case-reports until and including the 10-year visit or 
death, whichever happened earlier, were retrospectively collected and reviewed 
with re-classification of the cases when applicable. Descriptive statistics were 
used.
RESULTS: Among the 435 seronegative cases (69 % women, baseline mean age was 59 
years), 13 (13/435 [3%]) could be reclassified as seropositive or erosive RA: 4 
turned seropositive (2 for ACPA and 2 for RF [> 2x reference level]) and 9 
developed erosions typical for RA. Reclassification revealed 68 (16%) cases of 
polymyalgia rheumatica, 46 (11%) psoriatic arthritis, 45 (10%) osteoarthritis, 
38 (8.7%) spondyloarthritis, 15 (3.4%) plausible reactive arthritis, 10 (2.3%) 
gout, 17 (3.9%) pseudogout, 6 (1.4%) paraneoplastic arthritis, 6 (1.4%) juvenile 
arthritis, 2 (0.5%) haemochromatosis, 3 (0.7%) ankylosing spondylitis, 2 (0.5%) 
giant cell arteritis, and 8 miscellaneous diagnoses. The other 140 patients 
(32%) could not be reclassified in any clear-cut diagnosis and had features of 
transient arthritis (n=41), seronegative spondyloarthritis (n=47), while 49 
remained unspecified.
CONCLUSIONS: Over a 10-year follow-up period, reclassification revealed 
significant heterogeneity in the diagnosis of seronegative RA. Therefore, 
seronegative arthritis should not be studied as a homogenous entity.

OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have shown that a combination treatment of 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus (TAC) may be an option for lupus 
nephritis (LN) patients that do not adequately respond to initial treatment. We 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment of MMF and TAC in 
LN patients with suboptimal response to prior MMF or TAC treatments.
METHODS: In this multicentre study, we retrospectively enrolled 62 patients with 
class III, IV, or V LN who inadequately responded to MMF or TAC treatment. Those 
patients were then treated with a combination of MMF and TAC for 6 months. The 
primary outcome was complete remission (CR) at 6 months, and secondary outcomes 
included overall response and adverse events.
RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment with the drug combination, CR was achieved 
in 14 of 62 patients (22.6%), and 35 (56.5%) patients responded. A significant 
reduction in proteinuria and lupus disease activity score was observable after 3 
months. After 1 year, the CR rate increased to 36.4% (20 of 55 patients), and 
the overall response rate (n=38, 69.1%) also increased from 6 months. Twenty-one 
patients reported 29 adverse events, including severe infection requiring 
hospitalisation (n=3, 10.3%), infection not requiring hospitalisation (n=2, 
6.9%), and herpes zoster (n=4, 13.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a combined MMF and TAC treatment, with a 
favourable adverse-event profile, may be a beneficial option for LN patients 
with inadequate response to either MMF or TAC treatments.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory 
disease of unknown etiology, characterised by symmetric erosive synovitis, 
leading inevitably to the destruction of cartilage and bone as well as bursa and 
tendon sheaths of joints. Our aim of this study was to decipher the differential 
expression of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the plasma of RA 
patients with active disease, using magnetic bead-based Luminex Multiple Analyte 
Profiling (xMAP) technology, for precision medicine.
METHODS: We obtained plasma samples from RA patients (n=25) from the 
Rheumatology Clinic at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) after written informed consent for their inclusion 
in this study. Besides, we have used the plasma samples from inflammatory 
osteoarthritis (OA) patients (n=10) and healthy volunteers (n=10) for comparison 
analyses. Plasma samples were examined using the Human Cytokine Magnetic 30-plex 
panel (Novex®), Invitrogen, USA) and analysed by MAGPIX® instrument (Luminex 
Corporation, USA).
RESULTS: Though several pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth 
factors present in the 30plex magnetic bead panel were not significantly 
(p>0.05) increased in the plasma of RA patients, the levels of plasma Th1 
associated proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, and IL-6 and Th2 associated cytokines 
such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were significantly (p<0.05) upregulated compared to 
OA and normal controls. The proinflammatory IL-12 as well as anti-inflammatory 
IL-10 and IL-1RA were significantly (p<0.05) upregulated in the plasma of RA 
patients compared to normal controls. Also, the chemokines such as IP-10, RANTES 
and IL-8 as well as growth factors such as EGF, and VEGF were significantly 
(p<0.05) increased in RA.
CONCLUSIONS: The MAGPIX data showed that the cytokines, chemokines and growth 
factors were differentially regulated systemically in patients with active RA 
compared to OA and normal controls. Hence, the Luminex xMAP technology-based 
multiplex immunoassays offer clues to formulate effective therapeutic strategies 
for RA patients with active disease irrespective of their treatment regimen and 
duration of treatment and, thus, an indispensable tool in precision medicine.

OBJECTIVES: The presence of serological markers associated with inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) has been studied in spondyloarthritis with conflicting 
results. The anti-glycan antibodies: anti-laminaribioside, anti-chitobioside, 
and anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibodies (ALCA, ACCA, and AMCA) are 
serological markers previously associated with IBD. We aim to investigate the 
prevalence of these antibodies in spondyloarthritis in comparison with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from consecutive patients with 
spondyloarthritis and were compared to RA and healthy controls. Anti-glycan 
antibodies - ALCA, ACCA and AMCA - were assessed using ELISA (Glycominds Ltd, 
Israel). Demographic characteristics, family history, disease pattern, skin 
evaluation (for PsA), disease activity and a questionnaire for gastrointestinal 
symptoms were recorded.
RESULTS: Seventy patients were recruited: 36 ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 28 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). No difference in ALCA or AMCA levels was observed 
between all the study groups. Significantly higher levels of ACCA were observed 
in RA patients, compared to healthy controls (p=0.002). One or more of the 
anti-glycan antibodies was found in 16.7%, and 3.6% of patients with AS and PsA, 
respectively, compared to 7.3% in healthy controls and 27% in RA (p=0.09). No 
correlation was found between the presence of anti-glycan antibodies and 
gastrointestinal symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data fail to show an increased prevalence of anti-glycan 
antibodies in AS or PsA patients. ACCA were found to be significantly higher in 
RA patients than in controls, and may serve as an inflammatory biomarker. The 
present results do not support a role for antiglycan antibodies as biomarkers 
for spondyloarthritis.

INTRODUCTION: A new insulin pump system was tested under everyday conditions for 
user evaluation and safety assessment prior to its launch in Europe. This 
insulin pump is focused on easy handling and uses prefilled cartridges.
METHODS: The pump system was used by 35 adult subjects with type 1 diabetes, 
experienced in insulin pump therapy, under everyday conditions for approximately 
one month each. All subjects rated various aspects of the system after home use; 
technical issues and safety parameters were assessed throughout the study.
RESULTS: All 35 subjects completed the study as planned and used the system for 
a total of 1013 days. After home use, 74% of the subjects were very satisfied or 
quite satisfied with the new pump. The subjects confirmed that the system is 
easy to use, especially considering general handling, bolus delivery and basal 
rate settings, infusion set, and cartridge change. Potential for improvements 
was seen in the touchscreen, warnings and alarms, the blind bolus function, the 
availability of a bolus calculator (was not available at time of study), and the 
cartridge size as rated by the study participants. Safety analysis did not raise 
any concerns for the use of this system.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the users testing the system were satisfied with the 
novel insulin pump system and the system was safe for use under everyday 
conditions by this study population.

BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to medication is a challenging problem in daily 
clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To assess reasons for non-adherence in patients with chronic 
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) in a direct comparison including 
evaluation of treatment necessity and concerns.
METHODS: ALIGN was a non-interventional, multicountry, multicentre, 
self-administered, cross-sectional, epidemiologic survey study. Here, we 
investigate the German, Austrian and Swiss (DACH) cohort. Six hundred thirty-one 
patients with different IMIDs (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, 
psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) 
under systemic therapies were evaluated concerning adherence, beliefs of 
necessity and concerns towards treatment in patients with IMIDs.
RESULTS: The DACH cohort had significantly different levels of adherence 
depending on the IMID (P < 0.05) and the type of therapy (P < 0.05). Based on 
the significant influence of concerns on treatment adherence (P < 0.05) and the 
high belief of treatment necessity, patients could be classified in four 
attitudinal segments, which were unequally distributed throughout various IMIDs. 
High concerns had a significant influence on non-adherence, whereas necessity 
did not. Older age, female sex, TNFi mono-, conventional combination and TNFi 
combination therapy are positively associated with adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: In the DACH region, patients are less concerned about medication 
and believe in the necessity of treatment. Therefore, we suggest adapting the 
communication in the various patient groups.

OBJECTIVES: To provide evidence for the revision of clinical practice guideline 
(CPG) for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody 
(ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) by the Japan Research Committee for 
Intractable Vasculitis.
METHODS: PubMed, CENTRAL, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society were searched 
for articles published between January 1994 and January 2015 to conduct 
systematic review (SR), and the quality of evidence was assessed with GRADE 
approach.
RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two non-RCTs were adopted 
for remission induction therapy, three RCTs and two non-RCTs for plasma 
exchange, and five RCTs and one non-RCT for remission maintenance therapy. A 
significant difference was found in efficacy and safety for the following 
comparisons. In the non-RCT adopted for remission induction therapy, 
glucocorticoid (GC) + cyclophosphamide (CY) was significantly superior to GC 
monotherapy regarding remission. GC + intravenous CY for remission induction 
therapy was superior to GC + oral CY regarding death at one year, serious 
adverse events, and serious infection. Concomitant use of plasma exchange for 
remission induction therapy of AAV with severe renal dysfunction reduced risk of 
end-stage renal disease versus non-users at month 3.
CONCLUSION: This SR provided necessary evidence for developing CPG for the 
management of ANCA-associated vasculitis.

Personalized Adaptive CBR Bolus Recommender System for Type 1 Diabetes.

Torrent-Fontbona F, Lopez B.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic disease. Those who have it must 
administer themselves with insulin to control their blood glucose level. It is 
difficult to estimate the correct insulin dosage due to the complex glucose 
metabolism, which can lead to less than optimal blood glucose levels. This paper 
presents PepperRec, a case-based reasoning (CBR) bolus insulin recommender 
system capable of dealing with an unrestricted number of situations in which 
T1DM persons can find themselves. PepperRec considers several factors that 
affect glucose metabolism, such as data about the physical activity of the user, 
and can also cope with missing values for these factors. Based on CBR 
methodology, PepperRec uses new methods to adapt past recommendations to the 
current state of the user, and retains updated historical patient information to 
deal with slow and gradual changes in the patient over time (concept drift). The 
proposed approach is tested using the UVA/PADOVA simulator with 33 virtual 
subjects and compared with other methods in the literature, and with the default 
insulin therapy of the simulator. The achieved results demonstrate that 
PepperRec increases the amount of time the users are in their target glycaemic 
range, reduces the time spent below it, while maintaining, or even reducing, the 
time spent above it.

To investigate type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) affecting bone remodeling in the 
context of menopause in female rats. The animals were subjected to either 
ovariectomy (OVX) which was performed to mimic postmenopausal estrogen 
deficiency, and/or type 1 diabetes mellitus which was established by the 
intra-abdominal administration of 50 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). Single-loaded 
groups were the OVX group and the STZ group, while the combined group was the 
OVX+STZ group. Bone histomorphometry was performed on the tibial metaphysis by 
Micro-CT scanning. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the activity of 
osteoblast and osteoclast by counteracting with antibodies against their 
respective specific marker enzymes. The gene expression of key molecules 
involved in osteoblastic and osteoclastic signaling pathways were analyzed by 
RT-qPCR. The results showed a significant bone volume decrease in both 
single-loaded groups and combined group with the combined group suffering 
greatest bone loss and bone structural deterioration (p<0.001). 
Immunohistochemical staining and RT-qPCR revealed an increase in osteoblastic 
(p<0.001) and osteoclastic (p<0.01) activities in OVX rats while there was a 
decrease (p<0.05) in those of STZ rats. When OVX and STZ were combined, the rats 
exhibited a further decrease in osteoblastic activity (p<0.001) and a similar 
level of osteoclastic activity (p>0.05) compared to their STZ counterparts. 
These results demonstrated that STZ-induced T1DM reverses OVX-associated high 
bone turnover osteoporosis to the type of low bone turnover, leading to greater 
bone loss and structural defect.

INTRODUCTION: The patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) associate an 
increased risk of atherosclerosis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictors of an abnormal ankle-brachial index 
(ABI), surrogate measure of atherosclerosis, in patients with APS.
METHODS: The ABI was measured according to standard recommendations in 106 
patients. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in all cases. A 
large spectrum of APS antibodies was determined in 73 patients.
RESULTS: A total of 106 patients diagnosed with APS were included. 28.3% 
patients included were found to have low ABI. Anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I 
(aβ2GPI) IgG antibodies [4.00 (1.00-79.00) vs 3.00 (0.00-29.00) U/mL, P = 0.02] 
and antiprothrombin (aPT) IgM antibodies [4.50 (0.00-82.00) vs 3.00 
(0.00-14.00) U/mL, P = 0.05] titers were found to be higher in patients with 
abnormal ABI. However, after multivariate regression analysis, only the aβ2GPI 
IgG titer remained predictor of low ABI (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: aβ2GPI IgG associated with impaired ABI in patients with APS. This 
relation might reflect their involvement in the atherosclerosis occurrence.

BACKGROUND: Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease 
characterized by destruction of exocrine glands as a result of T and B cells 
infiltrated in glandular tissue. CD28 and CTLA-4 play a crucial role in T cell 
activation and inhibition. The aim of this study was to associate CD28 and CTLA4 
haplotypes with susceptibility to pSS in patients from western Mexico.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism 
were performed to identify CD28 and CTLA4 genotypes in 111 patients with pSS and 
138 control subjects (CS). Haplotype analysis was carried out by SHEsis program. 
Soluble serum levels of CD28 (sCD28) and CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) were quantified by 
ELISA kit.
RESULTS: The CD28 GC haplotype was associated with low risk to pSS (2.5-folds, 
P < 0.001). CTLA4 CAG and CGA were identified as genetic risk factor 
(P < 0.001;OR = 3.82[CI95%:2.022-7.296] and P < 0.001; 
OR = 11.38[CI95%:3.282-37.69] respectively). No difference in sCD28 and sCTLA-4 
were found between patients and CS. However, pSS patients carriers of CD28 
IVS3 + 17TC genotype showed high sCD28 (P = 0.039 vs TT carriers in CS). In 
regard to sCTLA-4, patient who carry CTLA4-319C>T, +49 A>G, and +6230 G>A, or 
their haplotypes did not show any difference.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CD28 GC, CTLA4 CAG, and CGA haplotypes are 
associated with susceptibility to pSS in patients from western Mexico. It seems 
that genetic control of CD28 and CTLA4 as well as local immune response in 
glandular tissue may regulate the impact of the gene expression in pSS. It is 
necessary to confirm this hypothesis in an integrative study.

BACKGROUND: The advent of newer second-line medical therapies (SLMT) for immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP) has contributed to decreased rates of splenectomy, 
following a trend to avoid or delay surgery. We aimed to characterize the 
long-term outcomes of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) for ITP at our institution, 
examining differences in LS efficiency when performed before or after SLMTs.
METHODS: Adults with primary ITP who underwent LS between 2002 and 2016 were 
identified. Retrospective review of electronic medical records was supplemented 
with telephone interviews. Treatment response was defined according to current 
guidelines as complete responders (CR), responders (R), and non-responders (NR). 
Kaplan-Meier estimates assessed relapse-free rates, and predictors of long-term 
response were investigated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: 109 patients met inclusion criteria, from which 42% were treated with 
an SLMT before referral to LS. LS was completed in all cases, with no 
conversions or intraoperative complications. The perioperative morbidity was 
7.3%, including 3 deep vein and 2 portal vein thrombosis, one reoperation for 
bleeding, and no mortalities. Splenectomy was initially effective in 99 patients 
(CR + R = 90.8%), and 10 patients were NR. At a median 62-month follow-up, 25 
patients relapsed, resulting in a 68% CR + R rate. Proportion of CR + R was 
similar in patients who previously received SLMT and those who did not (61 vs. 
76.7%, p = 0.08). CR + R patients were younger (45 vs. 53, p = 0.03), had higher 
preoperative platelet counts (36 vs. 19, p = 0.01), and experienced a higher 
increment in platelet counts during hospital stay (117 vs. 38, p < 0.001) as 
well as 30-days postoperatively (329 vs. 124, p < 0.001). Only a robust response 
in platelet count at 30-days postoperatively was independently associated with 
long-term response (OR 1.005, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: LS was curative in 68% of patients, with no statistically 
significant difference when performed before or after SLMTs. Outcomes remain 
challenging to predict preoperatively, with only a robust increase in platelet 
counts on short term being associated with long-term response.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease 
with a high risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that modulate protein translation, and 
dysregulation is seen in autoimmunity, atherosclerosis, and CVD. We investigate 
associations between circulating miRNAs and markers of atherosclerosis in SLE 
patients.
METHOD: A group (n = 121) of well-characterized SLE patients were screened for 
atherosclerosis by cardiac computed tomography and carotid ultrasound. RNA was 
purified from plasma and 46 specific miRNAs were determined using quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Forty-one miRNAs were consistently detected. Fifty out of 118 available 
SLE patients had atherosclerosis. A profile consisting of three miRNAs 
(decreased miR-125b, miR-101, miR-375) was indicative of atherosclerosis. 
Multivariate logistic regression identified eight clinical manifestations 
associated with atherosclerotic outcome. The full classification profile showed 
a specificity of 88% and a sensitivity of 86%. Hierarchical clustering 
identified an eight-miRNA profile that differentiated a subgroup of SLE patients 
(n = 16) who had significantly increased venous thrombotic events (p = 0.045), a 
higher prevalence of β2-glycoprotein I antibodies (p = 0.029), and an increased 
prevalence of thrombocytopenia (p = 0.028).
CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional study, the circulating miRNA profile 
distinguished SLE patients with atherosclerosis from those without. Furthermore, 
an eight-miRNA signature was associated with thrombocytopenia, venous thrombotic 
events, and β2-glycoprotein I antibodies in SLE patients. Prospective studies 
are needed to confirm the findings and to establish the precise role of 
circulating miRNA profiling in the evaluation of atherosclerosis in SLE.

Purpose: To investigate differences in red blood cell (RBC) deformability 
between birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR) subjects and matched controls, and to 
postulate its relationship with lack of vascular occlusion in BCR. Methods: In a 
single center, prospective, non-randomized mechanistic study, blood samples were 
collected from eight healthy controls and nine BCR patients, and subjected to 
biochemical and hematological tests, as well as RBC indices assessment using 
dual-beam optical tweezers. Results: The mean age of the controls was 
52.37 ± 10.70 years and BCR patients was 53.44 ± 12.39 years. Initial cell size 
(Io) for the controls was 8.48 ± 0.25 μm and 8.87 ± 0.31 μm for BCR RBCs 
(p = 0.014). The deformability index (DI) for the controls was 0.066 ± 0.02 and 
that for BCR RBCs was 0.063 ± 0.03 (p = 0.441). Conclusion: There was no 
statistically significant difference in DI between RBCs from BCR and healthy 
controls. This may explain the rare occurrence of retinal vascular occlusion 
despite the underlying vasculitic pathophysiology of BCR.

BACKGROUND: Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis have 
excellent postliver transplant survival despite having many comorbidities. We 
hypothesized that this could be due to a selection bias.
METHODS: We analyzed the United Network for Organ Sharing data from 2002 to 2016 
and compared postliver transplant survival of NASH (n = 7935) patients with 
cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC) (n = 6087), alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) (n = 16 810), 
and autoimmune hepatitis cirrhosis (AIH) (n = 2734).
RESULTS: By 3 years of listing, the cumulative incidence (CI) of death or 
deterioration was 29% for NASH, 28% for CC and AC, and 24% for AIH, but when 
adjusted for risk factors, the CI was similar for NASH and AIH. The factors that 
increased the risk of waiting list removal due to death/deterioration were poor 
performance status, encephalopathy, diabetes, high Model for End-stage Liver 
Disease, Hispanic race, older age and a low serum albumin. Most patients were 
transplanted within the first year (median, 2 months; interquartile range, 1-7 
months) of listing and by 5 years, the unadjusted CI of transplantation was 54% 
for NASH, 52% for CC, 51% for AIH, and 48% for AC. The adjusted CI of 
transplantation within 2 months of listing was higher for AC (subhazard ratio 
[SHR], 1.17), AIH (SHR, 1.17), and CC (SHR, 1.13) when compared with NASH, but 
after 2 months, adjusted transplantation rates decreased in AC (SHR, 0.6), AIH 
(SHR, 0.78), and CC (SHR, 0.95). The negative predictors of receiving a 
transplant were dialysis, female sex, nonwhite race, high albumin, and 
creatinine.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NASH cirrhosis are not disadvantaged by higher 
waitlist removal or lower transplantation rates.

OBJECTIVES: Measurement of serum biomarkers at disease onset may improve 
prediction of disease course in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
We evaluated the multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score and early changes 
in MBDA score for prediction of 28-joint Disease Activity Score based on 
C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) remission and radiographic progression in the 
double-blinded OPERA trial.
METHOD: Treatment-naïve RA patients (N = 180) with moderate or high DAS28 were 
randomized to methotrexate (MTX) + adalimumab (n = 89) or MTX + placebo (n = 91) 
in combination with glucocorticoid injection into swollen joints. X-rays of 
hands and feet were evaluated at months 0 and 12 (n = 164) by the total Sharp 
van der Heijde score (TSS). The smallest detectable change (1.8 TSS units) 
defined radiographic progression (∆TSS ≥ 2). Clinical remission (DAS28-CRP 
< 2.6) was assessed at baseline and 6 months. MBDA score was determined at 0 and 
3 months and tested in a multivariable logistic regression model for predicting 
DAS28 remission at 6 months and radiographic progression at 1 year.
RESULTS: Baseline MBDA score was independently associated with radiographic 
progression at 1 year [odds ratio (OR) = 1.03/unit, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.01-1.06], and changes in MBDA score from baseline to 3 months with 
clinical remission at 6 months [OR = 0.98/unit, 95% CI 0.96-1.00). In 
anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP)-positive patients, 35 of 
89 with high MBDA score (> 44) showed radiographic progression (PPV = 39%), 
compared with 0 of 15 patients (NPV = 100%) with low/moderate MBDA score (≤ 44) 
(p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Early changes in MBDA score were associated with clinical remission 
based on DAS28-CRP at 6 months. In anti-CCP-positive patients, a non-high 
baseline MBDA score (≤ 44) had a clinical value by predicting very low risk of 
radiographic progression at 12 months.

BACKGROUND: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a multifactorial autoimmune 
disease. The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) gene is an 
important negative regulator of signal transduction through the T-cell Receptors 
(TCR). A PTPN22 polymorphism, C1858T, has been found to be a risk determinant 
for several autoimmune diseases, including T1DM, in different populations.
OBJECTIVE: The present study was aimed to analyze a possible association between 
the C1858T polymorphism in Egyptian children with T1DM.
METHODS: This case-control study included 240 children divided evenly between 
T1DM patients and controls. The PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism was genotyped using 
polymerase chain reaction with Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP).
RESULTS: Both the 1858CΤ and 1858ΤΤ genotypes and the 1858T allele were found 
more frequently in patients (32.5% and 18.7%, respectively) than in controls 
(10% and 5.0%, respectively), P=0.013 and P=0.007, respectively. Among females, 
the 1858T allele was more common in patients (18%) than in controls (2.6%), 
P=0.014.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the PTPN22 1858T allele could be a T1DM 
susceptibility factor in the Egyptian population and that it might play a 
different role in susceptibility to T1DM according to gender in T1DM patients.

OBJECTIVE: A major characteristic of the autoimmune disease primary Sjögren's 
syndrome (SS) is salivary gland (SG) hypofunction. The inability of resident SG 
stem cells (SGSCs) to maintain homeostasis and saliva production has never been 
explained and limits our comprehension of mechanisms underlying primary SS. The 
present study was undertaken to investigate the role of salivary gland stem 
cells in hyposalivation in primary SS.
METHODS: SGSCs were isolated from parotid biopsy samples from controls and 
patients classified as having primary SS or incomplete primary SS, according to 
the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 
criteria. Self-renewal and differentiation assays were used to determine SGSC 
regenerative potential, RNA was extracted for sequencing analysis, single 
telomere length analysis was conducted to determine telomere length, and frozen 
tissue samples were used for immunohistochemical analysis.
RESULTS: SGSCs isolated from primary SS parotid gland biopsy samples were 
regeneratively inferior to healthy control specimens. We demonstrated that SGSCs 
from samples from patients with primary SS are not only lower in number and less 
able to differentiate, but are likely to be senescent, as revealed by telomere 
length analysis, RNA sequencing, and immunostaining. We further found that SGSCs 
exposed to primary SS-associated proinflammatory cytokines we induced to 
proliferate, express senescence-associated genes, and subsequently differentiate 
into intercalated duct cells. We also localized p16+ senescent cells to the 
intercalated ducts in primary SS SG tissue, suggesting a block in SGSC 
differentiation into acinar cells.
CONCLUSION: This study represents the first characterization of SGSCs in primary 
SS, and also the first demonstration of a linkage between an autoimmune disease 
and a parenchymal premature-aging phenotype. The knowledge garnered in this 
study indicates that disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs used to treat primary 
SS are not likely to restore saliva production, and should be supplemented with 
fresh SGSCs to recover saliva production.

OBJECTIVE: Given persistent challenges achieving optimal diabetes outcomes in 
adolescence, new interventions to support disease self-management and emotional 
well-being are needed. Approaches that emphasize adolescents' positive behaviors 
and attitudes ("strengths") are designed to incorporate positive provider 
communications into clinical encounters to encourage youths' engagement in 
adherence behaviors and enhance well-being.
METHODS: This pilot study tested the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
outcomes of a brief, strengths-based behavioral intervention for adolescents 
with type 1 diabetes. Adolescents (age 12-17 years) and parents were recruited, 
consented, and completed baseline and postintervention questionnaires. There was 
no randomization to a control group, and all participants received the pilot 
intervention. At the start of two clinic visits, diabetes care providers 
followed a semi-structured script to reinforce adolescents' diabetes-related 
strengths and adherence behaviors.
RESULTS: Of 116 eligible families, 84 consented and 64 completed baseline (M 
age = 15.0 ± 1.8 years, 56% female, 69% White, M HbA1c = 8.6 ± 1.6%). Providers 
reported the intervention usually (95%) took <10 min to deliver. Participants 
and providers enjoyed the intervention and would like to see it as part of 
routine clinical care. Pre-post data indicated significant improvements in 
youth-rated diabetes strengths, adherence, burden, and relationship with 
provider, parent-reported diabetes burden, and provider-rated relationship with 
family (p < .05). Objectively measured adherence and glycemic control did not 
change.
CONCLUSIONS: This brief strengths-based, clinic-integrated intervention was 
feasible to conduct and stakeholders were satisfied. This intervention holds 
promise to have a positive impact on adolescents' diabetes adherence, 
well-being, and provider relationships. Lessons were learned to improve 
implementation and participant experience for a larger study.

Perianesthetic Implications and Considerations for Myasthenia Gravis.

Muckler VC, O'Brien JM, Matson SE, Rice AN.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease in which 
antibodies against the post-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the 
neuromuscular junction develop. Although the exact cause of MG remains unknown, 
the thymus is a common factor in many cases. Patients with underlying junctional 
disease, such as MG, have greater anesthesia-related risks because of their 
known predisposition toward prolonged muscle weakness. Medications given in the 
perioperative period, such as anesthetic agents, antibiotics, cardiovascular 
drugs, and corticosteroids, affect neuromuscular transmission that contributes 
to muscle weakness. Judicious use of neuromuscular blocking agents for patients 
with MG must be considered. This patient population is at high risk for 
respiratory failure, and therefore must be carefully assessed throughout the 
perioperative period to ensure that a regular spontaneous respiratory pattern is 
sufficient to provide adequate oxygenation. Perianesthesia providers must 
consider anesthetic, ventilatory, and pharmacologic implications when proposing, 
providing, and recovering anesthesia for the patient with MG.

Chronic exposure of tubular renal cells to high glucose contributes to 
tubulointerstitial changes in diabetic nephropathy. In the present study, we 
identified a new fibrosis gene called galectin-1 (Gal-1), which is highly 
expressed in tubular cells of kidneys of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse 
models. Gal-1 protein and mRNA expression showed significant increase in kidney 
cortex of heterozygous Akita+/- and db/db mice compared with wild-type mice. 
Mouse proximal tubular cells exposed to high glucose showed significant increase 
in phosphorylation of Akt and Gal-1. We cloned Gal-1 promoter and identified the 
transcription factor AP4 as binding to the Gal-1 promoter to up-regulate its 
function. Transfection of cells with plasmid carrying mutations in the binding 
sites of AP4 to Gal-1 promoter resulted in decreased protein function of Gal-1. 
In addition, inhibition of Gal-1 by OTX-008 showed significant decrease in 
p-Akt/AP4 and protein-promoter activity of Gal-1 and fibronectin. Moreover, 
down-regulation of AP4 by small interfering RNA resulted in a significant 
decrease in protein expression and promoter activity of Gal-1. We found that 
kidney of Gal-1-/- mice express very low levels of fibronectin protein. In 
summary, Gal-1 is highly expressed in kidneys of type 1 and 2 diabetic mice, and 
AP4 is a major transcription factor that activates Gal-1 under hyperglycemia. 
Inhibition of Gal-1 by OTX-008 blocks activation of Akt and prevents 
accumulation of Gal-1, suggesting a novel role of Gal-1 inhibitor as a possible 
therapeutic target to treat renal fibrosis in diabetes.-Al-Obaidi, N., Mohan,

Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy driven by gluten, which can be 
associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. The presence of granular IgA deposits, 
detected by direct immunofluorescence, is the hallmark of dermatitis 
herpetiformis; nevertheless, IgA deposits have also been demonstrated in healthy 
skin of patients with coeliac disease. The main objective of this study was to 
investigate whether IgA deposits could be found in the skin of patients with 
coeliac disease who have non-dermatitis herpetiformis inflammatory skin 
diseases. Direct immunofluorescence was performed on perilesional skin biopsies 
of 6 patients with coeliac disease with non-dermatitis herpetiformis 
inflammatory skin diseases and, as control, on 12 non-coeliac patients with 
inflammatory skin diseases. IgA deposits were found in all of the patients with 
coeliac disease, but were absent in the control group. In conclusion, IgA 
deposits may be considered an immunopathological marker for coeliac disease; 
therefore, patients with coeliac disease showing skin manifestations with 
positive direct immunofluorescence should be investigated carefully in order to 
make a differential diagnosis between dermatitis herpetiformis and other 
non-dermatitis herpetiformis inflammatory skin diseases.

"A body in transformation"-An empirical phenomenological study about 
fear-avoidance beliefs towards physical activity among persons experiencing 
moderate-to-severe rheumatic pain.

Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To gain a better understanding of fear-avoidance beliefs 
towards physical activity and body awareness in people experiencing 
moderate-to-severe rheumatic pain.
BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are long-term 
conditions with pain as the prominent symptom. Health-promoting physical 
activity is recommended and can have an analgesic effect. High self-rated pain 
has previously been reported to be associated with increased fear-avoidance 
behaviour in relation to physical activity. Body awareness, which includes 
attentional focus and awareness of internal body sensations, could be valuable 
in the nursing care of long-term diseases.
DESIGN: Empirical phenomenological.
METHODS: An empirical phenomenological psychological method was applied. The 
interviews took place between autumn 2016-spring 2017 with 11 informants (eight 
women and three men, age range 44-71 years) who were diagnosed with rheumatoid 
arthritis (n = 7) or psoriatic arthritis (n = 4), with a disease duration 
ranging from 3-35 years. The mean visual analogue scale score in the study 
sample was 60 mm.
RESULTS: Three typologies were identified: "My relatively fragile physical 
status", "I am an active creator" and "Part of something bigger than myself."
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings indicated that pain anticipation and 
fear-avoidance beliefs towards physical activity sometimes affected the 
behaviour of individuals with long-term rheumatic pain syndromes. People 
experiencing moderate-to-severe rheumatic pain tended to focus on their fragile 
physical and emotional state. By adopting a more favourable attitude towards the 
self, the body could be restored to a state of calm and balance.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The current findings are relevant for healthcare 
professionals engaged in health-promotion clinical practice.

Chronic diabetes is associated with ventricular dysfunctions in the absence of 
hypertension and coronary artery diseases. This condition is termed as diabetic 
cardiomyopathy (DCM). There is no favourable treatment available for the 
management of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Recent studies have reported increase in 
circulating thrombin level among diabetic patients which is responsible for 
hypercoagulability of blood. Thrombin induces inflammation and fibrosis, and 
enhances cardiac cell growth and contractility in vitro. In this study, we have 
investigated the effects of argatroban; a direct thrombin inhibitor against DCM 
in streptozotocin-induced type-1 diabetes. Diabetes was induced by single dose 
of streptozotocin (STZ; 50 mg/kg, i.p.) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. After 4 
weeks of diabetes induction, the animals were treated with argatroban (0.3 and 
1 mg/kg, i.p. daily) for the next 4 weeks. The effect of argatroban was 
evaluated against diabetes-associated cardiac dysfunction, structural alteration 
and protein expression. STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited significant decline 
in left ventricular functions. Four weeks of treatments with argatroban 
significantly improved ventricular functions without affecting heart rate. 
Further, it also protected heart against structural changes induced by diabetes 
as shown by reduction in fibrosis, hypertrophy and apoptosis. The improvement in 
cardiac functions and structural changes was associated with significant 
reduction in left ventricular expression of thrombin receptor also termed as 
protease-activated receptor-1 or PAR1, p-AKT (ser-473), p-50 NFκB and caspase-3 
proteins. This study demonstrates beneficial effects of argatroban via 
improvement in cardiac functions and structural changes in STZ-induced DCM. 
These effects may be attributed through reduction in cardiac inflammation, 
fibrosis and apoptosis.

This study aims at presenting a nonlinear, recursive, multivariate prediction 
model of the subcutaneous glucose concentration in type 1 diabetes. Nonlinear 
regression is performed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, by either the 
fixed budget quantized kernel least mean square (QKLMS-FB) or the approximate 
linear dependency kernel recursive least-squares (KRLS-ALD) algorithm, such that 
a sparse model structure is accomplished. A multivariate feature set (i.e., 
subcutaneous glucose, food carbohydrates, insulin regime and physical activity) 
is used and its influence on short-term glucose prediction is investigated. The 
method is evaluated using data from 15 patients with type 1 diabetes in 
free-living conditions. In the case when all the input variables are considered: 
(i) the average root mean squared error (RMSE) of QKLMS-FB increases from 
13.1 mg dL-1 (mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) 6.6%) for a 15-min 
prediction horizon (PH) to 37.7 mg dL-1 (MAPE 20.8%) for a 60-min PH and (ii) 
the RMSE of KRLS-ALD, being predictably lower, increases from 10.5 mg dL-1 (MAPE 
5.2%) for a 15-min PH to 31.8 mg dL-1 (MAPE 18.0%) for a 60-min PH. Multivariate 
data improve systematically both the regularity and the time lag of the 
predictions, reducing the errors in critical glucose value regions for a 
PH ≥ 30 min. Graphical abstract ᅟ.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) is a frequent problem in lupus patients, 
regardless of their overt neuropsychiatric (NP) involvement.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to test cognitive abilities in systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients by means of neuropsychological testing and 
event-related potentials (ERPs), and to search for their cognitive abilities 
correlations with a wide range of auto-antibodies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 37 SLE patients were subjected to a battery of 
neuropsychological tests, recommended by the American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR), and to ERPs. They were also tested for a wide range of auto-antibodies 
(anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2-GPI), lupus 
anticoagulant, anti-dsDNA, anti-nucleosome, anti-ribosomal P (anti-Rib-P), 
anti-ganglioside, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B.
RESULTS: Cognitive impairment was found in 35% of patients, mostly with NP SLE 
(NPSLE), and was associated with higher disease activity, measured by the SLE 
Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), and with a longer duration of central nervous 
system (CNS) involvement. There were no differences in the immunological status 
between CI patients and those without cognitive decline, but some antibodies 
were correlated with worse results in certain neuropsychological tests 
(anti-dsDNA and worse results of Rey Complex Figure Test - RCFTc for copying and 
RCFTr for recall, and of verbal fluency test (VFT); aCL IgG and worse results in 
Digit Span (DS) and in RCFTc). Event-related potentials showed prolonged N200 
and P300 latencies in SLE patients in comparison to controls, but no differences 
were found between SLE and NPSLE patients. Mean P300 latency was significantly 
longer in patients without anti-nucleosome antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Event-related potentials can be used as a complementary tool in 
assessing CI in SLE patients. The immunological status of patients with CI did 
not differ from that of patients without cognitive problems.

There is little consensus regarding mortality data in bullous pemphigoid (BP). 
The aim of this study was to evaluate mortality among a relatively large cohort 
of Israeli patients with BP and to perform a meta-analysis synthesizing existing 
data on 1-year mortality rates of patients with BP. This retrospective cohort 
study of 287 patients diagnosed with BP between 2000 and 2015 compared the 
mortality of patients with BP with age- and sex-matched control subjects in the 
general population. The results showed 1-, 5- and 10-year mortality rates of 
26.9%, 56.9% and 69.5%, respectively, and a 3.4-fold higher risk of death. A 
systematic review and meta-analysis were then performed using a random effects 
model. Including the current study, 25 studies comprising 4,594 patients met the 
eligibility criteria. The pooled estimate of 1-year mortality rate was 23.5% 
(95% confidence interval 20.2-26.8; I2=81%; p < 0.001). The pooled 1-year 
mortality rate of European cohorts was prominently higher relative to the pooled 
rates of cohorts from the USA and Asia.

OBJECTIVES: The association of myasthenia gravis (MG) and inflammatory myositis 
(IM) is rare and typically only one of the diseases is present. The management 
of the 2 diseases differs, therefore it is important to recognize the 
concomitant presentation. Here, we report a case series of 7 patients with 
co-existing MG and IM with review of the literature.
METHOD: We identified 7 patients with concurrent MG and IM who were followed at 
the Neuromuscular Disease Program at a tertiary referral center in Vancouver, 
British Columbia from 2004 to 2017.
RESULT: All 7 patients had ocular or bulbar involvement as manifestation of MG. 
Three patients had simultaneous onset of MG and IM, 2 of whom presented with 
myasthenia crisis and fulminant myositis. In the other 4 patients, MG was the 
initial presentation and IM occurred 3-11 years after MG. Among these 7 
patients, 4 had underlying thymic pathology, including 2 with benign thymoma and 
2 with stage IV thymoma; all 4 patients had antibodies to acetylcholine receptor 
(AChR). Of the 3 patients with no thymic pathology by imaging or histology, 2 
had positive AChR antibody titer. For treatment, the thymoma was resected and 
chemotherapy was administered if appropriate. Additional immunosuppressive 
therapies including high-dose glucocorticoid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 
methotrexate, mycophenolate, or cyclosporine were necessary to achieve 
remission. Two patients with no thymoma had refractory MG and IM, and both 
responded to rituximab. We also conducted a literature review on the clinical 
characteristics and management of this condition, and compared the previously 
reported cases to the patients in our series.
CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest case series of MG-IM overlap with or 
without thymic pathology. In this cohort, the 2 disease entities can occur 
simultaneously, or one presents before the other. Most of the patients responded 
well to steroid, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and immunosuppressive agents. 
In very refractory cases, rituximab appeared to be effective, which has not been 
reported for the treatment of this condition before.

Hyperglycemia results in the overproduction of free oxygen radicals that impair 
the endogenous antioxidant defenses. A randomized controlled trial was conducted 
to compare the effect of 3 months of antioxidant supplementation in the form of 
foods rich in micronutrients with pharmacological supplement on total 
antioxidant status of Indian children with type 1 diabetes. Ninety children with 
diabetes (mean age 11.5 ± 3.6 yrs, 37 boys) were randomly allocated to three 
groups: Group 1 (n = 31) = DM controls; Group 2 (n = 30) = multimicronutrient 
syrup; and Group 3 (n = 29) = dietary supplements (nine snack recipes rich in 
micronutrients). They received intervention for 3 months. Healthy controls were 
enrolled from local schools. Fasting blood was tested for total antioxidant 
status (TAS) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). Children with diabetes had 
lower TAS (0.70 ± 0.2 vs. 1 ± 0.24 mmol/l, p = .0001) compared to healthy 
controls. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were similar at baseline for 
all groups of diabetic children. Group 1 showed significant deterioration in TAS 
at endline (0.72 ± 0.16 vs. 0.60 ± 0.17 mmol/l, p = .008). Increase in TAS 
recorded in Group 2 was from 0.66 ± 0.21 to 0.70 ± 0.16 mmol/l and in Group 3 
was from 0.68 to 0.73 mmol/l. There was a significant difference between Group 1 
and Group 3 for percentage change in TAS (-13% vs. 16%, p = .035). 
Postsupplementation there was an increase in TAS values in children with 
diabetes, but they were still lower than in healthy controls. Indian diabetic 
children have compromised antioxidant status, which may be improved by 
incorporation of multimicronutrient-rich recipes in their diets.

hypertension (PAH) that we attribute to the use of 4-AP. A 64-year-old woman 
with multiple sclerosis presented with dyspnea. After excluding other secondary 
causes of pulmonary hypertension, a diagnosis of severe PAH due to 4-AP was made 
based on right heart catheterization. History revealed that the dyspnea began 
with the initiation of 4-AP. After discontinuation of 4-AP therapy and 
initiation of ambrisentan and tadalafil, dyspnea and pulmonary arterial pressure 
have improved significantly and one specific PAH treatment was stopped. 4-AP is 
an outward rectifying potassium channel blocker with a vasoconstrictor effect in 
animal's pulmonary artery. According to the chronological sequence of events, 
the lack of other etiology, and its pharmacological plausibility, 4-AP is highly 
suspected to have induced our patient's PAH.

Purpose: To report a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease associated with 
hepatitis B vaccination. Methods: Case report. Results: A 43-year-old Caucasian 
male presented with a three-week history of blurry vision, pain, photophobia, 
and redness in both eyes. Three days prior to the onset of symptoms, he had 
received the hepatitis B virus vaccine. Clinical evaluation revealed multifocal 
placoid lesions in the posterior pole, choroidal thickening, and serous macular 
detachment. Targeted laboratory investigations were negative for infectious or 
autoimmune markers. After treatment with oral corticosteroids, the patient had 
resolution of symptoms with near-total recovery of visual function. The patient 
later reported systemic findings of hearing loss, tinnitus, and integumentary 
changes. A diagnosis of VKH disease was made and inflammation was managed with 
oral corticosteroids followed by methotrexate for long-term disease control. 
Conclusions: VKH disease is an inflammatory condition primarily affecting the 
choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and outer retina. The underlying etiology 
is unclear, but it can be associated with a viral prodrome suggesting an 
infectious trigger in a genetically susceptible individual. Our case suggests 
that hepatitis B vaccination may trigger a similar inflammatory response.

PURPOSE: IVIM-DW imaging has shown potential usefulness in the study of 
pancreatic lesions. Controversial results are available regarding the 
reliability of the measurements of IVIM-derived parameters. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate the reliability and the diagnostic potential of 
IVIM-derived parameters in differentiation among focal solid pancreatic lesions 
and normal pancreas (NP).
METHODS: Fifty-seven patients (34 carcinomas-PDACs, 18 neuroendocrine 
neoplasms-panNENs, and 5 autoimmune pancreatitis-AIP) and 50 subjects with NP 
underwent 1.5-T MR imaging including IVIM-DWI. Images were analyzed by two 
independent readers. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), slow component of 
diffusion (D), incoherent microcirculation (Dp), and perfusion fraction (f) were 
calculated. Interobserver reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC). A Kruskal-Wallis H test with Steel-Dwass post hoc test was 
used for comparison. The diagnostic performance of each parameter was evaluated 
through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: Overall interobserver agreement was excellent (ICC = 0.860, 0.937, 
0.968, and 0.983 for ADC, D, Dp, and f). D, Dp, and f significantly differed 
among PDACs and panNENs (p = 0.002, < 0.001, and < 0.001), albeit without 
significant difference at the pairwise comparison of ROC curves (p = 0.08-0.74). 
Perfusion fraction was higher in AIP compared with PDACs (p = 0.024; 
AUC = 0.735). Dp and f were higher in panNENs compared with AIP (p = 0.029 and 
0.023), without differences at ROC analysis (p = 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: IVIM-derived parameters have excellent reliability and could help 
in differentiation among solid pancreatic lesions and NP.

PURPOSE: Venous thromboembolic events (VTE), with their life-threatening 
manifestation as pulmonary embolism, are potential adverse effects of 
intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse therapy, partially due to a 
hypercoagulable state. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of IVMP 
on selected hemostatic parameters in patients with moderate-to-severe Graves' 
orbitopathy (GO).
METHODS: 26 euthyroid patients with GO were treated with 12 pulses of IVMP 
(6 × 0.5, 6 × 0.25 g every week). Hemostatic variables [factor (F) II, FV, FVII, 
FVIII, fibrinogen, antithrombin, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 
prothrombin time, international normalized ratio of prothrombin time, platelets 
and D-dimer] were analysed before, 24 and 48 h after 1st, 6th and 12th pulse.
RESULTS: A constant, transient trend in changes of some hemostatic variables was 
observed after all assessed pulses. We discovered an increase in median activity 
of FVIII 24 and 48 h after pulses, with a shortening of aPTT 24 h after each 
IVMP pulse (p < 0.00005). FVII decreased 24 h after each pulse (p < 0.0005 after 
1st and 12th, p < 0.00005 after 6th). Fibrinogen level decreased 48 h after each 
pulse (P < 0.00005). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in 
hemostatic parameters in the long-term evaluation. Therapy was concluded in one 
patient after the 9th pulse due to pulmonary embolism.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase of FVIII activity is a consequence of treatment with 
IVMP and occurs after each pulse. In patients with additional risk factors of 
VTE, anticoagulation prophylaxis should be considered.

OBJECTIVE: To describe etiology, clinical profile, treatment and outcome of 
children with pulmonary hemorrhage.
METHODS: A chart review of children with pulmonary hemorrhage attending 
Pediatric Pulmonology services of a tertiary care hospital in North-India was 
done.
RESULTS: Data of 44 children (mean age 59.2 ± 32.1 mo; 28 boys) were included 
for the study. Possible idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis 16 (36.4%), post 
infectious complications 11 (25%), immune mediated disorders 8 (18.2%), cardiac 
and vascular disorders 7 (15.9%), and airway pathologies 2 (4.5%) were the 
etiologies of pulmonary hemorrhage. Treatment options like medications, 
bronchial artery embolization and surgical resections were offered according to 
the etiology. Children with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and those with 
immune mediated diseases were treated with systemic steroids and steroid sparing 
agents; the latter group took longer time to respond and had more relapses.
CONCLUSIONS: Identification of main etiological categories of pulmonary 
hemorrhage in children could be useful to plan investigations and management of 
wide range of causes in more practical way.

Emerging targets for the treatment of lupus erythematosus: There is no royal 
road to treating lupus.

Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine , Hokkaido University , Sapporo , 
Japan.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease 
that preferentially affects women of child-bearing age. Most current treatments 
for SLE with the exception of belimumab are not target-specific. Nontargeted 
therapy such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and other immunosuppressive 
drugs results in unwanted adverse effects. Although progress in treatment, 
including supportive therapy, has dramatically improved the prognosis of 
patients with SLE, better treatment drugs and protocols with fewer adverse 
effects and higher efficacy for the most severe form of SLE are needed. 
Advancements in genomics, immunology, and pathophysiology in the field of 
systemic autoimmunity have provided physicians with increasing knowledge, but 
the most appropriate treatment for each patient with SLE remains to be 
established. Therefore, the search for novel treatment targets in patients with 
SLE is ongoing. This review focuses on recent findings in the genetics of lupus 
and the abnormalities in cellular interactions, cytokine profiles, and 
intracellular signaling in patients with SLE. Novel molecular targets for lupus, 
mostly introduced through clinical trials, are then discussed based on these 
findings.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
associations between BRAFV600E mutation, the American College of Radiology (ACR) 
thyroid imaging, reporting and data system (TI-RADS) on ultrasound and 
clinicopathological characteristics in patients with a solitary papillary 
thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 397 patients with a 
solitary PTC, proved pathologically. BRAFV600E mutation status was detected in 
postoperative samples by real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction. 
Associations of BRAFV600E mutation with the ACR TI-RADS and clinicopathological 
characteristics were analyzed.
RESULTS: In this study, the incidence of BRAFV600E mutation was 81.4% (323/397) 
in patients with a solitary PTC. Univariate analyses showed that BRAFV600E 
mutation was significantly associated with margin, higher ACR TI-RADS point 
scores, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In multivariate analyses, lobulated or 
irregular margin was independently associated with BRAFV600E mutation in total 
solitary PTC. Furthermore, both in total solitary PTC and papillary thyroid 
microcarcinoma, BRAFV600E mutation was associated with ACR TI-RADS point scores, 
which was positively correlated with the risk of BRAFV600E mutation. There was 
no significant relationship between BRAFV600E mutation and ACR TI-RADS point 
scores in PTC >10 mm. In addition, Hashimoto's thyroiditis had a significant 
negative association with BRAFV600E mutation.
CONCLUSION: A lobulated or irregular margin of the thyroid nodule is 
independently associated with BRAFV600E mutation in patients with PTC. In 
addition, higher ACR TI-RADS point scores is an independent risk factor for 
BRAFV600E mutation, and ACR TI-RADS point scores is positively associated with 
the risk of BRAFV600E mutation in solitary PTC, especially in papillary thyroid 
microcarcinoma. Our findings may be helpful for preoperative identification and 
medical management of PTC patients with BRAFV600E mutation.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a combination of anti-rheumatic drugs is 
associated with the risk of coronary artery diseases (CAD) in incident 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
METHODS: This population-based cohort study used administrative data to identify 
6260 newly-diagnosed patients with RA (age ≥20 years) as the study group. The 
study end-point was occurrence of CAD according to the ICD-9-CM codes. Exposure 
to different combinations of drugs and the risk of CAD was assessed. These 
included different combinatiosn of celecoxib (Cx), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 
methotrexate (MTX), and sulfasalazine (SSZ). Patients who never used Cx, HCQ, 
MTX, or SSZ were used as a reference group. A Cox proportional hazards model was 
used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of disease after controlling for 
demographic and other co-morbidities. When the proportionality assumption was 
violated, the spline curve of the Scaled Schoenfeld residuals was fitted to 
demonstrate the estimated effect on CAD over time for drug usage.
RESULTS: Among RA patients, the adjusted HR (95% confidence interval) of CAD for 
"Cx only", "Cx and HCQ ever", and "Cx, HCQ, MTX, and SSZ ever", were 0.29 
(0.19-0.44), 0.46 (0.24-0.88), and 0.42 (0.24- 0.75), respectively, during the 
first period of 0-3, 4, or 7 years. However, they became 1.04 (0.78-1.38), 1.16 
(0.62-2.19), and 0.59 (0.32-1.08), respectively, during the second time period 
of 3, 4, or 7-10 years. The adjusted HR (95% CI) of CAD for "Cx, MTX, and SSZ 
ever" remains constant at 0.12 (0.02-0.89).
CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib-DMARDs drug combinations were associated with reduced CAD 
risk on incident RA patients, and some of them exhibited the time-varying drug 
effect.

PURPOSE: To describe thyroid eye disease (TED)-like orbital inflammatory 
syndrome in 3 cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
METHODS: All consecutive patients treated by the senior author who were 
receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors and developed TED-like orbital 
inflammation were included.
RESULTS: Three cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors 
developed orbital inflammation. The first patient was treated with a combination 
of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitor and a programmed cell death 
protein 1 inhibitor and developed TED-like orbital inflammation with normal 
thyroid function and antibody levels. The second patient had a previous 
diagnosis of Graves disease without TED, and developed TED soon after initiating 
treatment with a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor. The third patient 
developed acute hyperthyroidism with symptomatic TED following treatment with an 
investigational cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitor agent. All 3 patients 
were managed with either systemic steroids or observation, with resolution of 
their symptoms and without the need to halt immune checkpoint inhibitor 
treatment for their cancer.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: TED-like orbital inflammation may occur as a side 
effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 
antigen-4 or anti-PD-1 inhibitors. To the best of their knowledge, this is the 
first reported case of TED as a result of programmed cell death protein 1 
inhibitor monotherapy. All 3 patients were treated with systemic steroids and 
responded quickly while continuing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors 
for their cancer. With increasing use of this class of drugs, clinicians should 
be familiar with the clinical manifestations and treatments for this adverse 
reaction.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo 
exercise program on cognition and mobility in participants with multiple 
sclerosis.
DESIGN: This is a prospective, single-blind, controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: A community rehabilitation program within a large metropolitan health 
service.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients with multiple sclerosis were referred for 
outpatient rehabilitation.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were allocated to one of two groups and undertook a 
cognitive-motor exercise program or monitoring (control group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognition and mobility were the main outcome measures. 
Cognition was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Frontal 
Assessment Battery. Mobility was assessed with the Timed Get Up and Go test, 
applied with and without dual task distractors.
RESULTS: The findings showed benefits provided by exercise on cognition and 
mobility. Differently, participants of the control group did not have 
significant changes in cognition scores after 6 mos of follow-up and had a worse 
performance in mobility tests.
CONCLUSION: Six months of exercise provided benefits to cognition and mobility 
in adults with multiple sclerosis. This trial was registered prospectively with 
the Brazilian Clinical Trials Register, ID: RBR-9gh4km 
(http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/?q=RBR-9gh4km).

The American College of Rheumatology's case definitions for 19 neuropsychiatric 
syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) constitute a comprehensive 
classification of nervous system events in this disease. However, additional 
strategies are needed to determine whether a neuropsychiatric syndrome is 
attributable to SLE versus a competing comorbidity. Cognitive function is a 
clinical surrogate of overall brain health, with applications in both diagnosis 
and determination of clinical outcomes. Ischemic and inflammatory mechanisms are 
both key components of the immunopathogenesis of neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), 
including abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier and autoantibody-mediated 
production of proinflammatory cytokines. Advances in neuroimaging provide a 
platform to assess novel disease mechanisms in a noninvasive way. The 
convergence of more rigorous clinical characterization, validation of 
biomarkers, and brain neuroimaging provides opportunities to determine the 
efficacy of novel targeted therapies in the treatment of NPSLE.

PURPOSE: To evaluate if parabulbar triamcinolone reduces orbital swelling in 
patients with Graves ophthalmopathy.
METHODS: This is a prospective study of a series of patients with active and 
moderate Graves ophthalmopathy. Short tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance 
was used to evaluate the intensity of the extraocular rectus muscles and orbital 
fat, before and after the treatment with parabulbar triamcinolone.
RESULTS: The signal intensity ratio of the sum of the OD rectus muscles was 3.67 
before treatment (95% CI, 3.26-4.09) and 2.83 after treatment (95% CI, 
2.63-3.03) (p < 0.001), and of the muscles of the left orbit, 3.94 before 
treatment (95% CI, 3.50-4.38) and 2.85 after treatment (95% CI, 2.56-3.14) (p < 
0.001). The signal intensity ratio of the fat decreased from 2.95 (95% CI, 
2.69-3.21) to 2.33 (95% CI, 2.07-2.58) (p < 0.001). After treatment, there were 
no local or systemic complications.
CONCLUSION: The use of parabulbar triamcinolone reduces orbital inflammation of 
patients with active and moderate Graves ophthalmopathy.

The microbiome is represented by microorganisms which live in a symbiotic way 
with the mammalian. Microorganisms have the ability to influence different 
physiological aspects such as the immune system, metabolism and behaviour. In 
recent years, several studies have highlighted the role of the microbiome in the 
pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Notably, in systemic lupus erythematosus an 
alteration of the intestinal flora (lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio) has 
been described. Conversely, changes to the gut commensal and periodontal disease 
have been proposed as important factors in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis. At the same time, other autoimmune diseases (i.e. systemic sclerosis, 
Sjögren's syndrome and anti-phospholipid syndrome) also share modifications of 
the microbiome in the intestinal tract and oral flora. Herein, we describe the 
role of the microbiome in the maintenance homeostasis of the immune system and 
then the alterations of the microorganisms that occur in systemic autoimmune 
diseases. Finally, we will consider the use of probiotics and faecal 
transplantation as novel therapeutic targets.

PURPOSE: To evaluate 2-year choroidal changes in eyes with birdshot 
retinochoroiditis (BRC).
METHODS: Thirteen patients (26 eyes) with BRC were prospectively evaluated 
during a 2-year period with standard automated perimetry (SAP), fluorescein 
angiography, indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography 
(Spectralis Heidelberg Retinal Angiograph + optical coherence tomography). 
Enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography was performed.
RESULTS: Eight patients (61%) were females; the patients mean age was 60 ± 4.7 
(range 49-66) years. At baseline, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.08 ± 
0.2 and foveal sensitivity threshold (FST) at SAP was 34.04 ± 2.6; at 2-year 
visit, no significant changes were observed (BCVA 0.06 ± 02, p = 0.1 and FST 
34.36 ± 2.6, p = 0.1). In all cases, at the 2-year visit, a significant 
reduction of choroidal thickness was present only at the fovea (p = 0.01). The 
rate of foveal choroidal thinning was 1.8 ± 1.6 µm per month. When compared to 
baseline, suprachoroidal fluid (SCF) was more frequent (42.3 vs. 23%; p = 
0.002). The amount of foveal choroidal thinning was associated with the presence 
of SCF at baseline (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: In patients with BRC, foveal choroidal thinning and increase of SCF 
at 2-year follow-up can be observed, even in the absence of visual loss.

BACKGROUND: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is partially impaired in patients 
with multiple sclerosis (MS). When given chemotherapy before receiving 
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, GFR might be further deteriorated.
OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of cyclophosphamide on GFR in patients with MS 
who undergo chemotherapy.
METHODS: We estimated GFR based on creatinine and cystatin C plasma 
concentrations in patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation to treat their MS.
RESULTS: Baseline GFR values were lower in the 28 patients with MS than in the 
20 healthy individuals. Also, according to the Chronic Kidney 
Disease-Epidemiology Collaborative Group (CKD-EPI) 2012 Creat-CysC equation 
criteria, 4 of 28 patients were classified as having chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) before receiving the chemotherapy drugs. After receiving 4 × 50 mg per kg 
body weight cyclophosphamide, abnormal GFR results were recorded in 12 of 28 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal function must be monitored in patients with MS undergoing 
autologous stem-cell transplantation. Also, chemotherapy should be constrained 
as much as possible to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

Despite the now significant contribution of magnetic resonance imaging, the 
accurate and timely diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is still clinically 
challenging. Al Hussona et al., with their case series, highlight the 
complexities of attributing paroxysmal, and in particular cortical, symptoms 
such as epileptic seizures to inflammatory demyelinating lesions, and 
establishing a diagnosis of MS based on them. In such circumstances an MS 
diagnosis is likely to be more tentative than for more typical MS presentations, 
and treatment choices should be weighed accordingly.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epileptic seizures frequently occur in people with 
multiple sclerosis (MS) and are thought to represent a manifestation of cortical 
pathology. However, at present, seizures are not considered to be a typical 
clinical presentation of demyelination.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this case series, we identified four people, who 
presented with seizures as a sole presenting feature, with demyelinating imaging 
abnormalities that satisfy current diagnostic criteria for a clinically isolated 
syndrome (CIS) or early MS.
CONCLUSION: Based on this case series, we propose that people presenting with de 
novo seizures, with concurrent radiological abnormalities suggestive of 
demyelination could potentially be considered to have a CIS.

Quantification of analytes such as cytokines in serum samples is intrinsic to 
translational research in immune diseases. Optimising pre-analytical conditions 
is critical for ensuring study quality, including evaluation of cytokine 
stability. We aimed to evaluate the effect on cytokine stability of storage 
duration prior to freezing of serum, and compare to plasma samples obtained from 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Protein stability was analysed 
by simultaneously quantifying 18 analytes using a custom multi-analyte profile 
in SLE patient serum and plasma samples that had been prospectively stored at 
4 °C for pre-determined periods between 0 and 30 days, prior to freezing. Six 
analytes were excluded from analysis, because most tested samples were above or 
below the limit of detection. Amongst the 12 analysed proteins, 11 did not show 
significant signal degradation. Significant signal degradation was observed from 
the fourth day of storage for a single analyte, CCL19. Proteins levels were more 
stable in unseparated serum compared to plasma for most analytes, with the 
exception of IL-37 which appears slightly more stable in plasma. Based on this, 
a maximum 3 days of storage at 4 °C for unseparated serum samples is recommended 
for biobanked samples intended for cytokine analysis in studies of human immune 
disease.

OBJECTIVE: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is often the presenting manifestation of 
giant cell arteritis (GCA). Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan often discloses the presence of 
large vessel vasculitis (LVV) in PMR patients. We aimed to identify predictive 
factors of a positive PET/CT scan for LVV in patients classified as having 
isolated PMR according to well-established criteria.
METHODS: A set of consecutive patients with PMR from a single hospital were 
assessed. All of them underwent PET/CT scan between January 2010 and February 
2018 based on clinical considerations. Patients with PMR associated to other 
diseases, including those with cranial features of GCA, were excluded. The 
remaining patients were categorized in classic PMR (if fulfilled the 2012 
EULAR/ACR classification criteria at disease diagnosis; n = 84) or atypical PMR 
(who did not fulfill these criteria; n = 16). Only information on patients with 
classic PMR was assessed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 84 patients (51 women) with classic PMR was 71.4 ± 
9.2 years. A PET/CT scan was positive in 51 (60.7%). Persistence of classic PMR 
symptoms was the most common reason to perform a PET/CT scan. Nevertheless, 
patients with positive PET/CT scan often had unusual symptoms. The best set of 
predictors of a positive PET/CT scan were bilateral diffuse lower limb pain (OR 
= 8.8, 95% CI: 1.7-46.3; p = 0.01), pelvic girdle pain (OR = 4.9, 95% CI: 
1.50-16.53; p = 0.01) and inflammatory low back pain (OR = 4.7, 95% CI: 
1.03-21.5; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Inflammatory low back pain, pelvic girdle and diffuse lower limb 
pain are predictors of positive PET/CT scan for LVV in PMR.

Antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines are one of the most promising 
strategies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. They act by inducing potent 
immune tolerance instead of generalized immunosuppression. Recently, we 
developed a novel antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 coding 
for chicken type II collagen (CCII) and confirmed its potent therapeutic 
efficacy in an established rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Here 
we report the prophylactic vaccination efficacy of a single 300 μg/kg dose of 
pcDNA-CCOL2A1 against CIA incidence, severity, and onset. CCOL2A1 transcripts 
were detected in the blood of CIA rats 14-42 days after intramuscular injection 
by 300 μg/kg pcDNA-CCOL2A1. The expression of CCOL2A1 transcripts increased 
quickly on day 21, peaked at day 28, and then gradually decreased thereafter. 
Importantly, a single prophylactic vaccination of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 14 days before 
CIA establishment significantly reduced CIA incidence and severity, deferred its 
onset, and was as efficacious as the current gold standard drug, methotrexate. 
The marked effects on CIA incidence and severity closely corresponded to the 
expression of CCOL2A1. Furthermore, prophylactic vaccination with pcDNA-CCOL2A1 
markedly decreased serum content of anti-type II collagen (CII) immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) antibodies, induced Th1-to-Th2 and Tc1-to-Tc2 shifts, and decreased the 
percentages of CD4+CD29+ and Th17 T cells. Prophylactic vaccination with 
pcDNA-CCOL2A1 also downregulated various Th1 cytokines, while upregulating both 
the Th2-type cytokine interleukin-10 and the Th3-type cytokine transforming 
growth factor β. Our results indicate that the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 DNA vaccine acts as 
a highly efficient inducer of specific immunotolerance that could be a promising 
option for RA treatment in the near future.

OBJECTIVE: To measure and compare musculoskeletal pain in patients with juvenile 
fibromyalgia (JFM) and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and to 
evaluate and compare pain perception and pain coping mechanisms in these 
patients.
METHODS: In this cross sectional study, we evaluated 150 children and 
adolescents, and their respective parents, from 3 different groups: JFM, 
polyarticular JIA, and healthy controls. Pain intensity and pain coping 
mechanisms were measured using specific questionnaires. Pain perception was 
evaluated according to three illustrations simulating situations that might 
cause pain: a shot, a bicycle fall, and social isolation. The patients' parents 
also filled out the questionnaires and provided a pain score that matched their 
child's perception of pain for each illustration.
RESULTS: The highest pain scores, the lowest pain coping strategy scores, the 
highest pain perception scores for all three illustrations, and the worse health 
related to quality of life indicators were observed in the JFM group, when 
compared to the JIA and control groups. The same pattern was observed with their 
parents.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with JIA and JFM behave differently in relation to pain 
perception and the development pain coping mechanisms. Pain should be evaluated 
from different perspectives for an individualized and efficient treatment of 
patients.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Mensurar e comparar a dor musculoesquelética em pacientes 
com fibromialgia juvenil (FMJ) e em pacientes com artrite idiopática juvenil 
poliarticular (AIJ); e avaliar e comparar a percepção e o enfrentamento da dor.
MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados, em estudo transversal, 150 crianças e adolescentes (e 
seus respectivos pais), divididos em três grupos: FMJ, AIJ e controles 
saudáveis. A mensuração e o enfrentamento da dor foram realizados por meio de 
instrumentos específicos. Para a avaliação da percepção da dor, desenvolveram-se 
três vinhetas com simulação de situações que pudessem gerar dor: aplicação de 
injeção, queda de bicicleta e isolamento social. Os pais e os pacientes 
responderam individualmente quanto à percepção da dor em cada situação.
RESULTADOS: As maiores notas de dor, os menores escores de enfrentamento da dor, 
as maiores notas para a percepção da dor nas vinhetas e os piores índices de 
qualidade de vida relacionada à saúde foram observados nos pacientes com FMJ, 
quando comparados aos pacientes com AIJ e aos controles. O mesmo padrão foi 
observado com os respectivos pais.
CONCLUSÕES: Pacientes com AIJ e FMJ se comportam diferentemente em relação à 
percepção da dor e ao desenvolvimento de técnicas para o enfrentamento da dor. A 
dor deve ser avaliada sob diferentes perspectivas para um planejamento mais 
individualizado e efetivo do tratamento desses pacientes.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is classified as an autoimmune disease which 
progressively results in the depletion of insulin-secreting β-cells. 
Consequently, the insulin secretion stops leading to hyperglycemic situations 
within the body. Under severe conditions, it also causes multi-organ 
diabetes-associated dysfunctionalities notably hypercoagulability, neuropathy, 
nephropathy, retinopathy, and sometimes organ failures. The prevalence of this 
disease has been noticed about 3% that has highlighted the serious concerns for 
healthcare professionals around the globe. For the treatment of this disease, 
the cell therapy is considered as an important therapeutic approach for the 
replacement of damaged β-cells. However, the development of autoantibodies 
unfortunately reduces their effectiveness with the passage of time and finally 
with the recurrence of diabetes mellitus. The development of new techniques for 
extraction and transplantation of islets failed to support this approach due to 
the issues related to major surgery and lifelong dependence on 
immunosuppression. For T1DM, such cells are supposed to produce, store, and 
supply insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis. The urgent need of 
much-anticipated substitute for insulin-secreting β-cells directed the 
researchers to focus on stem cells (SCs) to produce insulin-secreting β-cells. 
For being more specific and targeted therapeutic approaches, SC-based strategies 
opened up the new horizons to cure T1DM. This cell-based therapy aimed to 
produce functional insulin-secreting β-cells to cure diabetes on forever basis. 
The intrinsic regenerative potential along with immunomodulatory abilities of 
SCs highlights the therapeutic potential of SC-based strategies. In this 
article, we have comprehensively highlighted the role of SCs to treat diabetes 
mellitus.

University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that newly diagnosed diabetic patients need a lot 
of information about medical examinations, checkups, tests and precautions for 
its control besides its disastrous effects on heart, kidneys, eyes, foot and 
nerves. Patients in Saudi Arabia are generally not aware of most of the 
information they may need which is one the major reasons for its increasing 
number of patients. Past studies conducted are based on clinical data of 
hospitals and healthcare centers only discussed its effects.
METHODS: Present research was conducted through a survey questionnaire in the 
Arabic language from Type 1 and Type 2 patients to establish if they knew about 
this disease and its criticality in the day to day activities and were they 
being provided sufficient information about its requirements. Data for checkups, 
tests, management by food and nutrition and physical activity education were 
collected for this purpose. Approximately 25% female and 33% male patients 
reported that diabetes affected their day to day activities.
RESULTS: Analysis of results showed that awareness of importance of tests 
including blood glucose level test HbA1c was only among 50% patients, 51% Type 1 
did not have cholesterol test, 31% Type 1 and 16% Type 2 % never had eye test, 
97% Type 1 and 60% Type 2 were unaware of barefoot examination, 34% Type 1 and 
70% Type 2 never went to a dietician to ascertain their nutrition needs, 24% 
Type 2 did not know importance of exercise for diabetes control.
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that Saudi patients suffering from diabetes 
seriously lacked information about its monitoring, control and treatment in form 
of tests to be conducted and requirements of diet control and physical 
activities. Therefore, a national level awareness campaign for providing this 
information could be considered as a key requirement.

OBJECTIVES: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis-a primary systemic vasculitis-most 
frequent manifestations are respiratory. Airway disease can present with 
stenosis, and although subglottic stenosis (SGS) is well described, narrowing 
distal to the glottis has been more recently the focus of reporting. Our 
objectives, therefore, are to describe the frequency, characteristics, and 
treatment of tracheobronchial stenoses (TBS) in granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
(GPA) at our institution, a national referral center for respiratory diseases. 
Also, to identify factors associated with TBS development in GPA.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of all identified TBS cases (n-29) 
in whom their demographics, clinical and paraclinical features, and treatment 
were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Comparisons between those who 
developed and did not develop TBS (n-79) were established with the χ2 test with 
Yates correction or two-tailed exact Fisher test for comparisons among groups 
with or without this complication.
RESULTS: Females were predominantly affected by TBS (76%). Most patients had 
limited GPA (n-20, 69%). TBS appeared at a mean of 29 months after diagnosis of 
GPA. Main symptoms were dysphonia, stridor, and dyspnea. All TBS patients had 
tracheal involvement and 12 (41%) additional bronchial stenoses. Other 
accompanying manifestations by organ/system were rhinosinusal (n-26, 87%), 
musculoskeletal (n-16, 55%), ocular (n-13, 45%), pulmonary (n-12, 41%), renal 
(n-8, 27%), mucocutaneous (n-5, 17%), neurological (n-4, 13%). At TBS diagnosis, 
17 patients were PR3-ANCA and/or C-ANCA positive, while 9 were MPO-ANCA and/or 
P-ANCA positive; results on the remaining were either negative or ANCA were not 
performed at that time. Seventeen patients had simultaneous medical (8 with 
glucocorticoid therapy, 9 with immunosuppressants) and surgical therapy, while 
the rest only the latter at the time of TBS diagnosis. Relapses were frequent 
(one in 18 patients; two in 11, three in 9 and 2 individuals had ≥4 relapses). 
Factors positively associated with TBS were the presence of general and 
musculoskeletal symptoms and rhinosinusal disease, while those negatively 
associated were prednisone oral daily dose >10mgqd and azathioprine intake. The 
extent of disease, either generalized or limited was not associated with TBS 
development, nor were ANCA levels.
CONCLUSIONS: TBS are serious complications of GPA which can arise at any stage 
of the disease. Timely diagnosis plus optimal treatment and follow-up remain 
unmet needs.

OBJECTIVE: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) directed to proteinase 3 
(PR3) used to be considered the serologic marker for granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA). However, patients with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA positive 
GPA have been increasingly reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
clinical and pathological characteristics and outcome of Chinese patients with 
MPO-ANCA positive GPA.
METHODS: The clinical and renal histology data, renal outcomes, response to 
treatment, relapse and mortality were compared between patients with MPO-ANCA 
positive GPA and MPO-ANCA positive microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) as well as 
proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA positive GPA.
RESULTS: 455 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) were recruited in 
this study. 276/455 patients were classified as MPO-ANCA positive MPA, 4/455 
patients were classified as PR3-ANCA positive MPA, 124/455 were MPO-ANCA 
positive GPA and 51/455 were PR3-ANCA positive GPA. Compared with MPO-ANCA 
positive MPA patients, MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients had significantly higher 
level of BVAS and milder renal lesion at diagnosis. The probability of 
developing ESRD was significantly higher in patients with MPO-ANCA positive MPA 
than MPO-ANCA positive GPA. MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients were likely to have 
relapse than MPO-ANCA positive MPA patients. Compared with PR3-ANCA positive GPA 
patients, MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients had significantly higher proportion of 
female, less constitutional symptoms and milder renal lesion at diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MPO-ANCA positive GPA should be regarded as a unique 
subset of AAV. This subset of AAV patients had relatively milder renal injury. 
Although ANCA specificities play an important role in differentiating AAV, 
taking the disease type together to classify AAV may be more rational.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate treatment outcomes, hearing outcomes, and adverse 
effects of rituximab (RTX) for intractable otitis media with antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (OMAAV).
METHODS: Twenty-three patients who met the criteria proposed by the OMAAV study 
group were included. RTX was used for patients who had difficulty achieving 
induction of remission using glucocorticoids (GC) and intravenous 
cyclophosphamide (IVCY).
RESULTS: Six patients were treated with RTX (RTX group), while 17 patients did 
not require RTX for induction of remission (non-RTX group). All six patients in 
the RTX group achieved remission. Age, sex, and months from onset to diagnosis 
did not differ significantly between the groups. The air-conduction hearing 
thresholds at diagnosis and remission were 71.7±6.3dB and 50.1±5.1dB in the RTX 
group, and 56.8±4.8dB and 35.8±4.8dB in the non-RTX group, respectively. Hearing 
level at remission was significantly better in the non-RTX group (p<0.05), while 
hearing gain did not differ significantly between the groups. Infectious 
complications were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RTX is effective and safe for intractable 
OMAAV patients who have a poor response to GC and IVCY.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate large-vessel (LV) abnormalities on serial imaging in 
patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and discern predictors of new lesions.
METHODS: Clinical and imaging data from patients with GCA (including subjects 
diagnosed by LV imaging) enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal 
study and/or a randomized clinical trial were included. New arterial lesions 
were defined as a lesion in a previously unaffected artery.
RESULTS: The study included 187 patients with GCA, 146 (78%) female, mean (±SD) 
age at diagnosis 68.5 ± 8.5 years; 39% diagnosed by LV imaging. At least one 
arterial lesion was present in 123 (66%) on the first study. The most frequently 
affected arteries were subclavian (42%), axillary (32%), and thoracic aorta 
(20%). In 106 patients (57%) with serial imaging, new arterial lesions were 
noted in 41 patients (39%), all of whom had a baseline abnormality, over a mean 
(±SD) follow-up of 4.39 (2.22) years. New abnormalities were observed in 33% 
patients by year 2; clinical features of active disease were present at only 50% 
of these cases. There were no differences in age, sex, temporal artery biopsy 
positivity, or disease activity in patients with or without new lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with GCA, LV abnormalities on first 
imaging were common. Development of new arterial lesions occurred in patients 
with arterial abnormalities at first imaging, often in the absence of symptoms 
of active disease. Arterial imaging should be considered in all patients with 
GCA at diagnosis and serial imaging at least in patients with baseline 
abnormalities.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnostic value and 
therapeutic benefit of diagnostic splenectomy.
METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing splenectomy 
with an unknown diagnosis (UD), a hematologic malignancy (HM) or idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura. Surgical indications and postoperative outcomes were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: 113 splenectomy patients were identified. Of the UD patients undergoing 
splenectomy, 46% (n = 16) received a definitive diagnosis postoperatively. A 
change in diagnosis occurred in 12% (n = 4) of HM patients. Complete symptom 
relief was observed more often in UD patients who received a definitive 
diagnosis after splenectomy 69% (n = 11), compared to the 47% (n = 9) who did 
not receive definitive diagnosis postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic ability of splenectomy was 46% when the diagnosis 
was unknown preoperatively. Additionally, a majority of patients experienced 
relief of symptoms postoperatively. Splenectomy may be a useful diagnostic and 
therapeutic tool in select UD and HM patients.

PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that the orbit expands in the cranial vault 
after wide dural exposure after minimally invasive extradural transorbital 
decompression for thyroid eye disease.
METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort study of 36 patients (60 orbits). Preoperative 
and postoperative (6 months) orbital CT following extradural transorbital 
decompression was analyzed. Primary outcome measure was the percentage area of 
the cranial vault occupied by orbital and brain tissue in a predefined window 
before and after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were displacement of the 
anteriormost aspect of the temporal lobe, reduction in clinical proptosis, 
change in clinical activity score, and change in diplopia.
RESULTS: The mean percentage of the selected area of the cranial vault 
preoperatively was 0% orbital and 44% ± 15% brain tissue, compared with 70% ± 
16% orbital and 28% ± 14% brain tissue postoperatively (p < 0.001). Posterior 
movement of the brain was demonstrated in 59 of 60 orbits, with a mean 
displacement of 2.0 mm ± 1.3 mm (p < 0.001). Mean proptosis reduction was 
11.2 mm ± 3.6 mm (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with clinical activity 
score <3 compared with clinical activity score ≥3 was not significantly 
different after surgery (p = 0.163). Improved diplopia was noted in 5 patients 
(14%), and worsening diplopia was noted in 3 patients (8%), although these 
changes were not significant (p = 0.772). Intraoperative dural tear with 
cerebrospinal fluid leak was reported in 2 orbits (3%), which was successfully 
managed with fibrin glue, with no sequelae. No other complications were noted, 
including infection, spontaneous orbital pulsations, postoperative hemorrhage 
(intracranial or intraorbital), or reactivation of disease.
CONCLUSION: With wide exposure of the middle cranial fossa dura following 
extradural transorbital decompression, orbital tissue typically expands in the 
cranial vault.

In multiple sclerosis patients, demyelination is prominent in both the white and 
gray matter. Chronic clinical deficits are known to result from acute or chronic 
injury to the myelin sheath and inadequate remyelination. The underlying 
molecular mechanisms of remyelination and its failure remain currently unclear. 
Recent studies have recognized G protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) as an 
important regulator of oligodendrocyte development and remyelination. So far, 
the relevance of GPR17 for myelin repair was mainly tested in remyelinating 
white matter lesions. The relevance of GPR17 for gray matter remyelination as 
well as remyelination of chronic white matter lesions was not addressed so far. 
Here, we provide a detailed characterization of GPR17 expression during 
experimental de- and remyelination. Experimental lesions with robust and limited 
endogenous remyelination capacity were established by either acute or chronic 
cuprizone-induced demyelination. Furthermore, remyelinating lesions were induced 
by the focal injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the corpus 
callosum. GPR17 expression was analyzed by complementary techniques including 
immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and real-time PCR. In control 
animals, GPR17+ cells were evenly distributed in the corpus callosum and cortex 
and displayed a highly ramified morphology. Virtually all GPR17+ cells also 
expressed the oligodendrocyte-specific transcription factor OLIG2. After acute 
cuprizone-induced demyelination, robust endogenous remyelination was evident in 
the white matter corpus callosum but not in the gray matter cortex. Endogenous 
callosal remyelination was paralleled by a robust induction of GPR17 expression 
which was absent in the gray matter cortex. Higher numbers of GPR17+ cells were 
as well observed after LPC-induced focal white matter demyelination. In 
contrast, densities of GPR17+ cells were comparable to control animals after 
chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination indicating quiescence of this cell 
population. Our findings demonstrate that GPR17 expression induction correlates 
with acute demyelination and sufficient endogenous remyelination. This 
strengthens the view that manipulation of this receptor might be a therapeutic 
opportunity to support endogenous remyelination.

Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder with frequent clinical 
manifestation of arterial, venous or small vessel thromboembolic events and/or 
foetal morbidity. Hereby, we present a case report of a patient with a large 
arterial thrombus originating from the ostium of the right coronary artery 
accompanied by multiple systemic embolization and right ventricular failure. As 
a bridge-to-recovery strategy, an extracorporeal right ventricular assist device 
was successfully applied, representing an effective first choice option in 
selected patients with isolated acute right heart failure.

Diabetes mellitus is currently a major public health problem. A common 
complication of diabetes is cardiac dysfunction, which is recognized as a 
microvascular disease that leads to morbidity and mortality in diabetic 
patients. While ischemic events are commonly observed in diabetic patients, the 
risk for developing heart failure is also increased, independent of the severity 
of coronary artery disease and hypertension. This diabetes-associated clinical 
entity is considered a distinct disease process referred to as "diabetic 
cardiomyopathy". However, it is not clear how diabetes promotes cardiac 
dysfunction. Vascular endothelial dysfunction is thought to be one of the key 
risk factors. The impact of diabetes on the endothelium involves several 
alterations, including hyperglycemia, fatty acid oxidation, reduced nitric oxide 
(NO), oxidative stress, inflammatory activation, and altered barrier function. 
The current review provides an update on mechanisms that specifically target 
endothelial dysfunction, which may lead to diabetic cardiomyopathy.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects predominantly young women. Currently 
available disease-modifying drugs have neither been approved during pregnancy 
nor nursing.
AIMS: Evaluating the effect of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 
in MS patients with desire to have a baby.
METHODS: In all, 70 MS patients were either treated with IVIg before conception, 
during first trimester of pregnancy and 12 months postnatal (group I, n = 38) or 
started IVIg after delivery for 12 months (group II, n = 23) or were untreated 
(group III, n = 9). Relapse rates and disease progression were analyzed.
RESULTS: Pre-gestational relapse rates differed between groups. Lowest relapse 
rates were observed during late pregnancy, followed by an elevated relapse rate 
after delivery compared to the pre-pregnancy year and the first trimester. Only 
in group I, the postnatal relapse rate did not exceed the relapse rate before 
conception. IVIg treatment did not influence disease progression after delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: In MS patients, IVIg treatment during and/or after delivery is an 
option to reduce the incidence of relapses during pregnancy and the postnatal 
period. Surprisingly, untreated patients becoming pregnant showed an increase in 
the relapse rate in the first trimester compared with the pre-gestational 
period. How alterations of hormone status during pregnancy affect disease 
activity in MS has to be further investigated.

A Time-Friendly, Feasible Measure of Nutrition Knowledge in Type 1 Diabetes: The 
Electronic Nutrition and Carbohydrate Counting Quiz (eNCQ).

BACKGROUND: Greater knowledge about nutrition and carbohydrate counting are 
associated with improved glycemic control and quality of life in youth with type 
1 diabetes (T1D). However, limited assessments of nutrition and carbohydrate 
knowledge have been developed, and existing measures can be time-consuming, 
overly broad, or not conducive to routine clinical use. To fill this gap, we 
developed and examined the feasibility of administering the electronic Nutrition 
and Carbohydrate Counting Quiz (eNCQ).
METHOD: Ninety-two caregivers and 70 youth with T1D (mean age 12.5 years; mean 
time since diagnosis 5 years; English speaking) completed the 19-item eNCQ via 
tablet during a routine clinical visit. Completion time and item completion 
rates were used to assess feasibility. Relationships between eNCQ scores and 
patient demographics, diabetes management, and health outcomes were examined.
RESULTS: Participants took 10 minutes, on average, to complete the eNCQ. Total 
and Carbohydrate subscale scores (youth report) were negatively correlated with 
youth hemoglobin A1c (total r = -.38, carbohydrate r = -.38, Ps < .05), 
indicating that greater nutrition knowledge related to better glycemic control. 
Nutrition knowledge scores were generally high, but knowledge was negatively 
related to time since diabetes diagnosis ( r = -.276, P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support feasibility of the eNCQ to assess nutrition 
knowledge in routine clinical care. Following additional acceptability and 
validity testing, the eNCQ may identify families in need of further nutrition 
education. Nutrition assessment is particularly indicated for youth over one 
year since T1D diagnosis, as these families displayed lower nutrition knowledge 
and may need continuing education to maintain diabetes-specific nutrition 
knowledge over time.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coeliac disease (CD) is more common in those with type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and may be asymptomatic despite the presence of 
intestinal histological changes. Optimal screening practice guidelines differ 
internationally. We undertook a retrospective audit to determine the efficacy of 
current screening practice for CD in T1DM in our centre.
METHODS: All children and adolescents < 16 years, diagnosed with T1DM in our 
service and continuing to attend the service in January 2017 were included. Data 
on CD screening was collected and compared to current NICE, NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Of the 355 patients attending our service, 253 attended from T1DM 
diagnosis and all had CD screening performed in our centre. In 37 of 253 
patients, IgA-TTG was positive, providing a cumulative prevalence of 14.6%. Of 
these, 31(83.78%) with an elevated TTG on screening had no recorded 
gastrointestinal symptoms or CD-related clinical signs. Of the 35 TTG plus 
EMA-positive patients, 22/35 (59.46%) had diagnostic endoscopic biopsy. Nineteen 
(83.4%) had CD confirmed, 1 (4.54%) had negative biopsy and 2 (9%) had 
equivocal, non-diagnostic changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Timely diagnosis of CD can prevent chronic ill health in affected 
individuals, and in patients with T1DM, CD is an independent risk factor for 
increased morbidity and mortality. Given the high prevalence of atypical 
symptoms and silent CD in those with T1DM, in this and other studies, and the 
benefits of detection and treatment of CD, screening is essential. Large-scale 
data collection allowing for the development of evidence-based guidelines is 
required.

OBJECTIVE: MRI-detected inflammation is considered of diagnostic value for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its evaluation involves a time-consuming scoring 
of 61 joint-level features. It is not clear, however, which of these features 
are specific for RA and whether evaluating a subset of specific features is 
sufficient to differentiate RA patients. This study aimed to identify a subset 
of RA-specific features in a case-control setting and validate them in a 
longitudinal cohort of arthralgia patients.
METHODS: The difference in frequency of MRI-detected inflammation (bone marrow 
edema, synovitis, and tenosynovitis) between 199 RA patients and 193 controls 
was studied in 61 features across the wrist, metacarpophalangeal, and 
metatarsophalangeal joints. A subset of RA-specific features was obtained by 
applying a cutoff on the frequency difference while maximizing discriminative 
performance. For validation, this subset was used to predict arthritis 
development in 225 clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) patients. Diagnostic 
performance was compared to a reference method that uses the complete set of 61 
features normalized for inflammation levels in age-matched controls.
RESULTS: Subset of 30 features, mainly (teno)synovitis, was obtained from the 
case-control setting. Validation in CSA patients yielded an area of 0.69 (95% 
CI: 0.59-0.78) under the ROC curve and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 31%, 
compared to 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60-0.77) and 29% PPV of the reference method with 61 
features.
CONCLUSION: Subset of 30 MRI-detected inflammatory features, dominated by 
(teno)synovitis, offers a considerable reduction of scoring efforts without 
compromising accuracy for prediction of arthritis development in CSA patients.

Chronic pain represents one of the major medical challenges in the 21st century, 
affecting >1.5 billion of the world population. Overlapping and heterogenous 
symptoms of various chronic pain conditions complicate their diagnosis, 
emphasizing the need for more specific biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and 
understand the disease mechanisms. We have here investigated proteins found in 
human CSF with respect to known "pain" genes and in a cohort of patients with 
dysfunctional pain (fibromyalgia, FM), inflammatory pain (rheumatoid arthritis 
patients, RA) and non-pain controls utilized semi-quantitative proteomics using 
mass spectrometry (MS) to explore quantitative differences between these cohorts 
of patients. We found that "pain proteins" detected in CSF using MS are 
typically related to synaptic transmission, inflammatory responses, neuropeptide 
signaling- and hormonal activity. In addition, we found ten proteins potentially 
associated with chronic pain in FM and RA: neural cell adhesion molecule L1, 
complement C4-A, lysozyme C, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase zeta, 
apolipoprotein D, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, granulins, 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit alpha, mast/stem 
cell growth factor receptor Kit, prolow-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 1. These proteins might be of importance for understanding the 
mechanisms of dysfunctional/inflammatory chronic pain and also for use as 
potential biomarkers. SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic pain is a common disease and it 
poses a large burden on worldwide health. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a heterogeneous 
disease of unknown etiology characterized by chronic widespread pain (CWP). The 
diagnosis and treatment of FM is based on the analysis of clinical assessments 
and no measurable biomarkers are available. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been 
historically considered as a rich source of biomarkers for diseases of nervous 
system including chronic pain. Here, we explore CSF proteome of FM patients 
utilizing mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics method combined with 
multivariate data analysis in order to monitor the dynamics of the CSF proteome. 
Our findings in this exploratory study support notable presence of pain related 
proteins in CSF yet with specific domains including inflammatory responses, 
neuropeptide signaling- and hormonal activity. We have investigated molecular 
functions of significantly altered proteins and demonstrate presence of 176 
known pain related proteins in CSF. In addition, we found ten proteins 
potentially associated with pain in FM and RA: neural cell adhesion molecule L1, 
complement C4-A, lysozyme C, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase zeta, 
apolipoprotein D, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, granulins, 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit alpha, mast/stem 
cell growth factor receptor Kit, prolow-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 1. These proteins are novel in the context of FM but are known to be 
involved in pain mechanisms including inflammatory response and signal 
transduction. These results should be of clear significance and interest for 
researchers and clinicians working in the field of pain utilizing human CSF and 
MS based proteomics.

BACKGROUND: The antigenic trigger that drives expansion of circulating 
plasmablasts and CD4+ cytotoxic T cells in patients with IgG4-related disease 
(IgG4-RD) is presently unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to sequence immunoglobulin genes from single-cell clones of 
dominantly expanded plasmablasts and generate recombinant human mAbs to identify 
relevant antigens in patients with IgG4-RD by using mass spectrometry.
METHODS: Paired heavy and light chain cDNAs from dominant plasmablast clones 
were expressed as mAbs and used to purify antigens by using immunoaffinity 
chromatography. Affinity-purified antigens were identified by using mass 
spectrometry and validated by means of ELISA. Plasma levels of the antigen of 
interest were also determined by using ELISA.
RESULTS: mAbs expressed from the 2 dominant plasmablast clones of a patient with 
multiorgan IgG4-RD stained human pancreatic tissue sections. Galectin-3 was 
identified as the antigen specifically recognized by both mAbs. Anti-galectin-3 
autoantibody responses were predominantly of the IgG4 isotype (28% of the 
IgG4-RD cohort, P = .0001) and IgE isotype (11% of the IgG4-RD cohort, 
P = .009). No significant responses were seen from the IgG1, IgG2, or IgG3 
isotypes. IgG4 anti-galectin-3 autoantibodies correlated with increased plasma 
galectin-3 levels (P = .001), lymphadenopathy (P = .04), total IgG level 
increase (P = .05), and IgG4 level increase (P = .03).
CONCLUSION: Affinity chromatography using patient-derived mAbs identifies 
relevant autoantigens in patients with IgG4-RD. IgG4 galectin-3 autoantibodies 
are present in a subset of patients with IgG4-RD and correlate with galectin-3 
plasma levels. The marked increases in levels of circulating IgG4 and IgE 
observed clinically are, at least in part, caused by the development of IgG4- 
and IgE-specific autoantibody responses.

Antidiabetic therapeutics, including insulin as well as glucagon-like peptide 1 
(GLP-1) and its analogs, are essential for people with diabetes to regulate 
their blood glucose levels. Nevertheless, conventional treatments based on 
hypodermic administration is commonly associated with poor blood glucose 
control, a lack of patient compliance, and a high risk of hypoglycemia. 
Closed-loop drug delivery strategies, also known as self-regulated 
administration, which can intelligently govern the drug release kinetics in 
response to the fluctuation in blood glucose levels, show tremendous promise in 
diabetes therapy. In the meantime, the advances in the development and use of 
microneedle (MN)-array patches for transdermal drug delivery offer an 
alternative method to conventional hypodermic administration. Hence, 
glucose-responsive MN-array patches for the treatment of diabetes have attracted 
increasing attentions in recent years. This review summarizes recent advances in 
glucose-responsive MN-array patch systems. Their opportunities and challenges 
for clinical translation are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: The standard formula (SF) used in bolus calculators (BCs) determines 
meal insulin bolus using "static" measurement of blood glucose concentration 
(BG) obtained by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) fingerprick device. 
Some methods have been proposed to improve efficacy of SF using "dynamic" 
information provided by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and, in particular, 
glucose rate of change (ROC). This article compares, in silico and in an ideal 
framework limiting the exposition to possibly confounding factors (such as CGM 
noise), the performance of three popular techniques devised for such a scope, 
that is, the methods of Buckingham et al (BU), Scheiner (SC), and Pettus and 
Edelman (PE).
METHOD: Using the UVa/Padova Type 1 diabetes simulator we generated data of 100 
virtual subjects in noise-free, single-meal scenarios having different 
preprandial BG and ROC values. Meal insulin bolus was computed using SF, BU, SC, 
and PE. Performance was assessed with the blood glucose risk index (BGRI) on the 
9 hours after meal.
RESULTS: On average, BU, SC, and PE improve BGRI compared to SF. When BG is 
rapidly decreasing, PE obtains the best performance. In the other ROC scenarios, 
none of the considered methods prevails in all the preprandial BG conditions 
tested.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that, at least in the considered ideal framework, 
none of the methods to correct SF according to ROC is globally better than the 
others. Critical analysis of the results also suggests that further 
investigations are needed to develop more effective formulas to account for ROC 
information in BCs.

OBJECTIVES: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to play crucial roles in 
several physiological and biological processes. However, knowledge of lncRNAs in 
children with systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) remains limited. We 
investigate lncRNA expression profiling of cSLE and explore the potential 
function of lncRNAs.
METHODS: LncRNA and mRNA microarrays were performed to identify changes in 
lncRNA and mRNA expression between children with SLE and paired healthy 
children. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validated these results. 
A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathway analysis were performed to explore the potential lncRNA function.
RESULTS: A comparison between children with SLE and paired healthy children 
revealed that 1042 lncRNAs and 1162 mRNAs were differentially expressed. By 
using gene co-expression network analysis, we constructed a complex lncRNA 
target network consisting of 817 matched lncRNA-mRNA pairs for 309 
differentially expressed lncRNAs and 210 differentially expressed mRNAs. The 
results of further GO and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that lncRNAs were 
involved mainly in pathways with crucial pathobiological relevance in SLE.
CONCLUSIONS: We firstly characterised the expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNA 
in children with SLE and propose herein their possible roles in the pathogenesis 
of SLE. These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of SLE 
pathogenesis and may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for SLE therapy.

In the past years the peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement in systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) has received little attention despite its potential 
significant impact. The true prevalence of PNS in SLE reported in studies is 
variable and strongly influenced by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) case 
definition that includes seven PNS manifestations (acute inflammatory 
demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, autonomic disorder, mononeuropathy, 
myasthenia gravis, cranial neuropathy, plexopathy and polyneuropathy). Other 
peripheral manifestations, such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy and small fibre neuropathy, not included in the ACR 
nomenclature, have not been well characterised in SLE. The aim of this review is 
to focus on epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical features of all 
possible different expressions of PNS involvement in SLE, with the final 
objective to profile the patient's clinical characteristics.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) has paradoxically been found to be able to both activate 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as inhibit MMPs. However, these 
regulatory effects have not yet been observed in vivo, and it is unclear which 
pathway is relevant in vivo. We aim to track MPO regulation of MMP activity in 
living animals in neuroinflammation. Mice induced with experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of neuroinflammation and multiple 
sclerosis, were treated with either the MPO-specific inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic 
acid hydrazide or saline as control. Mice underwent concurrent magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) with the MPO-specific molecular imaging agent MPO-Gd and 
fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) with the MMP-targeting agent MMPsense on 
day 12 after induction. Biochemical and histopathological correlations were 
performed. Utilizing concurrent MRI and FMT imaging, we found reduced MMP 
activity in the brain with MPO inhibition, demonstrating MPO activity positively 
regulates MMP activity in vivo. In vivo MMPSense activation and MMP-9 activity 
correlated with MPO-Gd+ lesion volume and disease severity. This was 
corroborated by in vitro assays and histopathological analyses that showed MMP 
activity and MMP-9+ cells correlated with MPO activity and MPO+ cells. In 
conclusion, multimodal molecular imaging demonstrates for the first time MPO 
regulation of MMP activity in living animals. This approach could serve as a 
model to study the interactions of other biologically interesting molecules in 
living organisms.

OBJECTIVE: Fasting from dawn to dusk during Ramadan, including abstaining from 
water and food, is 1 of the pillars of Islam and is observed by the majority of 
Muslims. Most research concerning diabetes and fasting during Ramadan originates 
from Middle Eastern or South Asian countries; however, differences exist in 
hours of work and fasting, pharmacotherapy and blood glucose monitoring between 
these countries and Canada.
METHODS: An expert forum of 7 Canadian experts and 1 international expert 
collaborated to develop Canadian guidelines using the same evidence-based 
principles, with the exception of an independent methods review used for the 
Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines. Diabetes Canada scientific 
leadership and Canadian health-care providers performed independent external 
reviews. Religious leaders endorsed the position statement and provided letters 
of support. An informed patient participated in the position-statement 
development. Each recommendation was approved with 100% consensus of the expert 
forum.
RESULTS: Recommendations for risk stratification, education, pharmacotherapy and 
blood glucose monitoring for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who intend 
to fast during Ramadan have been developed.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Canadian position statement on the topic of 
Ramadan fasting and diabetes. It was developed by an expert faculty and endorsed 
by Diabetes Canada, and provides guidance about pharmacotherapy and glucose 
monitoring for health-care providers so that they can assist Canadian Muslims 
living with diabetes to observe fasting during Ramadan safely.

Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Correct insulin injection practice is essential for better diabetic 
control. The aim of this study is to investigate the level of competency of 
prefilled insulin pen usage (injection technique and storage) among diabetes 
patients in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey between March 2017 to July 2017 of randomly 
selected patients with diabetes attending Diabetes Treatment Center, Prince 
Sultan Military Medical City, Saudi Arabia, who are actively using a prefilled 
insulin pen, were interviewed to complete a pre-structured questionnaire to 
assess the competency of using the insulin pen. The contents of the 
questionnaire addressed the 6 competency components according to manufacturer 
recommendation (priming, count time, storage, using new needles, a store with no 
needles, and discard date), background, clinical and metabolic data. Results of 
the questionnaire were analyzed to identify common pitfalls and were also 
contrasted with background clinical and metabolic data.
RESULTS: 165 patients with diabetes (aged 14-70yrs) were interviewed for the 
study and all questioners completed properly. Only 14 (8.5%) patients were 
following all of the six competency components. Count time 52 (31.6%) was the 
least followed competency component of the six, whereas discard date and storage 
of insulin pen were the most followed with 165 (100%) and 159 (96.4%), 
consecutively. Education was the only significant variable related to the 
following more than 3 of the competency components, and logistic regression 
showed the college or higher educated patients to be three times more likely 
follow more than 3 of the competency components.
CONCLUSION: The study concluded that majority of patients are either ignoring or 
unaware of the major components of correct use of prefilled insulin in Saudi 
Arabia.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is associated with inflammation and 
increased lipolysis. The macrophage activation marker, soluble CD163 (sCD163), 
is associated with obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 
diabetes. We aimed to investigate whether sCD163 correlates with key elements of 
lipolysis in type 1 diabetes patients during mild DKA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated nine patients with type 1 diabetes twice 
during: (i) euglycemic control conditions and a bolus of saline; and (ii) 
hyperglycemic ketotic conditions induced by lipopolysaccharide administration 
combined with insulin deprivation. Blood samples, indirect calorimetry, 
palmitate tracer and adipose tissue biopsies were used to investigate lipid 
metabolism.
RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in plasma sCD163 levels after 
lipopolysaccharide exposure (P < 0.001). Concentrations of sCD163 were 
positively correlated with plasma concentrations of free fatty acids, palmitate 
rate of appearance and lipid oxidation rates, and negatively correlated to the 
expression of G0/G1 switch 2 gene messenger ribonucleic acid content in adipose 
tissue (P < 0.01 for all). Furthermore, sCD163 levels correlated positively with 
plasma peak concentrations of cortisol, glucagon, tumor necrosis factor-α, 
interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 (P < 0.01 for all). Data on lipolysis and 
inflammation have previously been published.
CONCLUSIONS: Macrophage activation assessed by sCD163 might play an important 
role in DKA, as it correlates strongly with important components of lipid 
metabolism including free fatty acids, palmitate, lipid oxidation, G0/G1 switch 
2 gene and pro-inflammatory cytokines during initial steps of DKA. These results 
are novel and add important knowledge to the field of DKA.

PURPOSE: Interleukin-37 (IL-37), member of the IL-1 family, is a natural 
suppressor of immune and inflammatory responses. Increased serum IL-37 levels 
were observed in several autoimmune diseases, including Graves' disease. To our 
knowledge, no data on Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) are available in the 
literature.
METHODS: Aim of our study was to measure serum IL-37 levels and evaluate their 
relationship, if any, with oxidative stress markers in HT patients. We enrolled 
45 euthyroid HT patients (5 M e 40 F, median age 40 years) and 50 age- and 
sex-matched healthy controls. None was under L-thyroxine therapy. Serum IL-37 
levels were measured by ELISA. Specific serum tests, such as derived reactive 
oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), and biological anti-oxidant potential (BAP) test 
were performed in all subjects to investigate the changes in oxidative balance, 
and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were determined as a specific marker 
of oxidative stress.
RESULTS: IL-37 levels were significantly higher in HT than in controls (median 
475 vs. 268 pg/ml, P = 0.018). In the same patients, serum oxidants (d-ROMs) 
were increased and anti-oxidants (BAP) decreased compared with controls 
(P = 0.011 and < 0.0001, respectively), clearly indicating an enhanced oxidative 
stress. In addition, AGEs levels were higher in HT patients than in controls 
(210 vs. 140 AU/g prot, P < 0.0001) and directly correlated with IL-37 levels 
(P = 0.048). At multivariate analysis, the main independent predictors that 
influenced IL-37 levels were both anti-thyroid antibodies (P = 0.026) and AGEs 
levels (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-37 is up-regulated in HT and may exert a protective role by 
counteracting oxidative stress and inflammation.

Purpose/aim: To evaluate the efficacy of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):cannabidiol 
(CBD) oromucosal spray (Sativex®) as add-on therapy to optimised standard 
antispasticity treatment in patients with moderate to severe multiple sclerosis 
(MS) spasticity.
METHODS: Sativex® as add-on therapy vs. further optimised first-line 
ANTispastics (SAVANT) was a two-phase trial. In Phase A, eligible patients 
received add-on THC:CBD spray for 4 weeks to identify initial responders [≥20% 
improvement from baseline in spasticity 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) 
score]. Following washout, eligible initial responders were randomised to 
receive THC:CBD spray or placebo for 12 weeks (double-blinded, Phase B). 
Optimisation of underlying antispasticity medications was permitted in both 
groups across all study periods.
RESULTS: Of 191 patients who entered Phase A, 106 were randomised in Phase B to 
receive add-on THC:CBD spray (n = 53) or placebo (n = 53). The proportion of 
clinically relevant responders after 12 weeks (≥30% NRS improvement; primary 
efficacy endpoint) was significantly greater with THC:CBD spray than placebo 
(77.4 vs. 32.1%; p < 0.0001). Compared with placebo, THC:CBD spray also 
significantly improved key secondary endpoints: changes in mean spasticity NRS 
(p < 0.0001), mean pain NRS (p = 0.0013), and mean modified Ashworth's scale 
(p = 0.0007) scores from Phase B baseline to week 12. Adverse events, when 
present, were mild/moderate and without new safety concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: Add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray provided better and clinically 
relevant improvement of resistant MS spasticity compared with adjusting 
first-line antispasticity medication alone.

Insulin pumps allow patients to attain better blood glucose control with more 
lifestyle flexibility. Their size and cost, however, limit their usefulness. 
Current CSII pumps are bulky, intrusive, and expensive. SFC Fluidics is 
addressing these problems by developing a new type of wearable patch pump based 
on the patented electro-chemiosmotic (ECO) microfluidic pumping technology. This 
nonmechanical pumping technology allows accurate and precise delivery of very 
small amounts of insulin and/or other drugs, including concentrated insulin. The 
pump engine is small and can be made inexpensively from injection molded parts, 
allowing its use in a disposable or semidisposable pod format. In addition, a 
single ECO pump engine can be used to deliver two drugs through independent 
pathways. Other features of SFC Fluidics' pod include latching safety valves 
that prevent accidental overdosing of insulin due to pressure changes and an 
instantaneous occlusion sensor that can immediately detect delivery failure at 
the first missed dose. These features allow for the development of a series of 
patch pumps that will offer users the benefit of CSII therapy in a more discreet 
and reliable patch pump form.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, and histone acetylation is an epigenetic 
modification pattern that activates gene transcription. However, the genome-wide 
histone H3 acetylation in new-onset type 1 diabetes patients has not been well 
described. Accordingly, we aimed to unveil the genome-wide promoter acetylation 
profile in CD4+ T lymphocytes from type 1 diabetes patients, especially for 
those who are glutamate decarboxylase antibody-positive.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 12 patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes who 
were glutamate decarboxylase antibody-positive were enrolled, and 12 healthy 
individuals were recruited as controls. The global histone H3 acetylation level 
of CD4+ T lymphocytes from peripheral blood was detected by western blot, with 
chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to microarrays to characterize the promoter 
acetylation profile. Furthermore, we validated the results of particular genes 
from chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to microarrays by using chromatin 
immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and analyzed the 
transcription level by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Elevated global histone H3 acetylation level was observed in type 1 
diabetes patients, with 607 differentially acetylated genes identified between 
type 1 diabetes patients and controls by chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to 
microarrays. The hyperacetylated genes were enriched in biological processes 
involved in immune cell activation and inflammatory response. Gene-specific 
assessments showed that increased transcription of inducible T-cell costimulator 
was in concordance with the elevated acetylation in its gene promoter, along 
with positive correlation with glutamate decarboxylase antibody titer in type 1 
diabetes patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study generates a genome-wide histone acetylation 
profile specific to CD4+ T lymphocytes in type 1 diabetes patients who are 
glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody-positive, which is instrumental in 
improving our understanding of the epigenetic involvement in autoimmune 
diabetes.

School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.

OBJECTIVE: To assess developmental trajectories of decision-making involvement 
(DMI), defined as the ways in which parents and children engage each other in 
decision-making about illness management, in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
and examine the effects of DMI on levels of and changes in adherence with age.
METHODS: Participants included 117 youth with T1D, enrolled at ages 8-16 years 
and assessed five times over 2 years. The cohort sequential design allowed for 
the approximation of the longitudinal curve from age 8 to 19 from overlapping 
cohort segments. Children and parents completed the Decision-Making Involvement 
Scale, which yields subscales for different aspects of DMI, and a self-report 
adherence questionnaire. Mixed-effects growth curve modeling was used for 
analysis, with longitudinal measures nested within participant and participants 
nested within cohort.
RESULTS: Most aspects of DMI (Parent Express, Parent Seek, Child Express, and 
Joint) increased with child age; scores on some child report subscales (Parent 
Express, Child Seek, and Joint) decreased after age 12-14 years. After 
accounting for age, Child Seek, Child Express, and Joint were associated with 
overall higher levels of adherence in both child (estimates = 0.08-0.13, 
p < .001) and parent (estimates = 0.07- 0.13, p < .01) report models, but they 
did not predict changes in adherence with age.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that helping children to be more proactive in T1D 
discussions, by encouraging them to express their opinions, share information, 
and solicit guidance from parents, is a potential target for interventions to 
enhance effective self-management.

In this randomized double-blind study, 4 groups of healthy subjects (50 per arm) 
participated to evaluate the effect of laquinimod, an oral treatment in 
development for multiple sclerosis and Huntington disease, on the QTc interval. 
Subjects received a dose of either 0.6 or 1.2 mg/day laquinimod for 14 days, 
placebo for 14 days, or 13 days of placebo followed by a dose of 400 mg 
moxifloxacin on day 14. Continuous 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded on 
day -1 (baseline) and days 14 to 17,  and quadruplicate electrocardiograms were 
extracted at predefined time points. The primary measure was time-matched change 
from baseline in individual QTc (QTcI), and an analysis of variance was 
conducted on the placebo-corrected change from baseline data (ddQTcI). 
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and safety assessments were included. Results 
showed that the upper limits of the 2-sided 90%CI for ddQTcI for both laquinimod 
doses were below 10 millisconds at all time points, whereas lower limits for 
moxifloxacin were above 5 milliseconds. No notable changes in ECG parameters 
were observed. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis showed no positive 
correlation between laquinimod plasma levels and QTcI. In conclusion, laquinimod 
was not found to affect cardiac repolarization or to cause prolongation of QTcI 
at doses of 0.6 and 1.2 mg/day.

PURPOSE: To report a case of accelerated retinal toxicity due to 
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use for treatment of Sjögren syndrome in a patient 
treated with concomitant chemotherapy for breast cancer.
METHODS: Observational case report.
RESULTS: A 56-year-old white woman using 400 mg HCQ (7.1 mg/kg real body weight) 
daily for a total of 2 years and 10 months for treatment of Sjögren syndrome 
with concomitant use of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide therapy (21-day cycle, 4 
cycles) followed by anastrozole for breast cancer, presented with visual 
complaints and findings of severe HCQ toxicity.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant breast cancer therapy may have a synergistic effect with 
HCQ leading to accelerated retinal toxicity. As such potential acceleration is 
poorly understood, patients on HCQ who are treated with concomitant chemotherapy 
should be considered for more frequent retinal screenings to maximize safety and 
preservation of vision.

OBJECTIVE: Central nervous system pathways involving pain modulation shape the 
pain experience in patients with chronic pain. The aims of this study were to 
understand the mechanisms underlying pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) and to identify brain signals that may serve as imaging markers for 
developing targeted treatments for RA-related pain.
METHODS: Patients with RA and matched control subjects underwent functional 
magnetic resonance imaging, using pulsed arterial spin labeling. The imaging 
conditions included 1) resting state, 2) low-intensity stimulus, and 3) 
high-intensity stimulus. Stimuli consisted of mechanical pressure applied to 
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints with an automated cuff inflator. The 
low-intensity stimulus was inflation to 30 mm Hg. The high-intensity stimulus 
was the amount of pressure required to achieve a pain intensity rating of 40 on 
a 100-point scale for each RA patient, with the same amount of pressure used in 
the matched control.
RESULTS: Among RA patients, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the medial 
frontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increased during both 
low-pressure and high-pressure stimulation. No rCBF changes were observed in 
pain-free controls. Region-of-interest analyses in RA patients showed that 
baseline rCBF in the medial frontal cortex was negatively correlated with the 
pressure required for the high-intensity stimulus and positively correlated with 
pain induced by the low-intensity stimulus. Baseline rCBF was also marginally 
correlated with disease activity). Regional CBF during high pain was positively 
correlated with pain severity and pain interference.
CONCLUSION: In response to clinically relevant joint pain evoked by pressure 
applied to the MCP joint, neural processing in the medial frontal cortex 
increases and is directly associated with clinical pain in patients with RA.

OBJECTIVES: To determine ultrasound (US) and clinical findings of thyroid 
microcalcifications in the absence of a nodule and their association with the 
risk of malignancy.
METHODS: The Institutional Review Board approved a 5-year retrospective study. 
Twenty-one patients with clustered or scattered thyroid microcalcifications in 
the absence of nodules on US images who underwent fine-needle aspiration 
biopsies (FNABs) were included. Demographic and clinical data, US findings, and 
pathologic results were registered. Patients with a suspicion of malignancy or 
papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) on FNAB underwent thyroidectomy. Patients with 
benign results on FNAB underwent clinical and US surveillance.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 21 patients was 33.2 years (29.5 years in patients 
with PTC patients and 39.4 years in those with benign findings; P = .034). 
Eleven of 21 patients had clustered microcalcifications (9 had cancer), and 10 
of 21 patients had scattered microcalcifications (4 of 10 had cancer; 
P = 0.063). Sixty-two percent of the patients had FNAB findings that were 
suspicious for cancer or had a diagnosis of cancer. Eleven of 13 patients had 
surgical thyroidectomy performed in our institution; in all cases, Hashimoto 
thyroiditis was confirmed. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that only 
age was significant (odds ratio, 0.9; P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the presence of thyroid microcalcifications 
without a nodule is suspicious for PTC. We found that both patterns were 
suspicious for PTC, particularly in young patients. Special concern arises for 
those clustered microcalcifications on a background of Hashimoto thyroiditis.

PURPOSE: Irisin is a newly identified myokine secreted by skeletal muscle and 
has significant effects on body metabolism. Thyroidal functional state has a 
profound influence on the metabolism of human body. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to investigate the possible changes in serum irisin concentrations 
before and after treatment in hypothyroid subjects.
METHODS: The study included 26 patients with overt hypothyroidism due to 
Hashimoto thyroiditis and 19 healthy subjects. Baseline serum thyroid function 
tests and presence of thyroid autoantibodies and levels of creatine kinase (CK) 
and irisin were measured in both groups. All measurements in the hypothyroid 
group were repeated after euthyroidism was achieved.
RESULTS: Serum irisin levels were significantly lower in the hypothyroid groups 
than the control group (p < 0.001). Negative correlation between irisin and 
thyroid stimulating hormone and CK levels (r = - 0.623, p < 0.001 and 
r = - 0.389, p = 0.008, respectively) and a positive correlation between irisin 
and free thyroxine (fT4) levels (r = 0.570, p < 0.001) was found. Serum CK 
levels decreased significantly after treatment (p < 0.001). Serum irisin levels 
significantly increased (from 57.4 to 99.8 U/L, p < 0.001) when the hypothyroid 
patients were treated to achieve euthyroidism.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providing 
insight that low serum irisin levels significantly increased following treatment 
to euthyroid state in overt hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. 
Larger scale studies are needed to confirm these results and to ensure irisin as 
a possible biomarker of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Purpose: To characterize peripheral blood T cells in juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis-associated uveitis (JIAU). Methods: Blood samples were taken from 
children with JIAU (n = 18), JIA without ocular involvement (n = 11), idiopathic 
anterior uveitis (IAU, n = 12), and healthy controls (n = 11). Cells were 
stained for T cell surface markers, and intracellular cytokine staining was 
performed after cell stimulation and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: The 
Th1/Th2 ratio was increased in JIAU patients. Numbers of IL-13-expressing cells 
an level of IL-13 and IL-10 expression per cell were increased in all patient 
groups; whereas, percentages of IL-5-expressing T cells were decreased. Numbers 
of proinflammatory Th17 cells and T cells expressing CTLA-4 were increased in 
all patient groups; whereas, γ/δ T cell numbers were decreased. Results from JIA 
and IAU were similar. Conclusion: T cell subtypes and potential T cell function 
are altered in pediatric patients with uveitis and arthritis as compared to 
healthy children.

Islet microvasculature provides key architectural and functional roles, yet the 
morphological features of islets from patients with type 1 diabetes are poorly 
defined. We examined islet and exocrine microvasculature networks by multiplex 
immunofluorescence imaging of pancreases from organ donors with and without type 
1 diabetes (n=17 and n=16, respectively) and determined vessel diameter, 
density, and area. We also analyzed these variables in insulin-positive and 
insulin-negative islets of 7 type 1 diabetes donors. Control islet vessel 
diameter was significantly larger (7.6 ± 1.1 μm) compared with vessels in 
diabetic islets (6.2 ± 0.8 μm; p<0.001). Control islet vessel density 
(number/islet) was significantly lower (5.3 ± 0.6) versus diabetic islets (9.3 ± 
0.2; p<0.001). Exocrine vessel variables were not significantly different 
between groups. Islets with residual beta-cells were comparable to control 
islets for both vessel diameter and density and were significantly different 
from insulin-negative islets within diabetic donors (p<0.05). Islet smooth 
muscle actin area had a significant positive correlation with age in both groups 
(p<0.05), which could negatively impact islet transplantation efficiency from 
older donors. These data underscore the critical relationship of islet 
beta-cells and islet vessel morphology in type 1 diabetes. These studies provide 
new knowledge of the islet microvasculature in diabetes and aging.

Currently, the clinical dynamics of glucagon need to be revised based on 
previous data obtained from conventional glucagon radioimmunoassays. In the 
present study, we evaluated plasma glucagon levels in type 1 diabetes patients 
using a newly-developed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and its 
association with clinical parameters and markers of diabetes complications were 
statistically assessed. The plasma glucagon level in 77 Japanese type 1 diabetes 
patients was 28.1 ± 17.7 pg/mL, and comparable with that reported previously for 
type 2 diabetes patients. However, the values were widely spread and did not 
correlate with plasma glucose values. Additionally, the average glucagon levels 
in patients in a hypoglycemic state (glucose level <80 mg/dL) did not increase 
(21.7 ± 12.2 pg/mL). The average glucagon level of patients experiencing 
hypoglycemia unawareness was significantly lower. Plasma glucagon levels 
evaluated using the new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were dysregulated in 
type 1 diabetes patients in respect to plasma glucose levels, suggesting 
dysregulation of secretion.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether patients with Anti-Glomerular Basement 
Membrane (GBM) disease and Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA), so 
called "Double-Positive" (DP), have a different clinical presentation and 
outcome compared to patients with anti-GBM antibody disease alone. This study 
describes the clinical and histologic characteristics as well as the patient and 
renal outcomes of DP patients at the University of Washington compared to 
patients with anti-GBM antibody disease alone.
METHODS: Adults admitted to the University of Washington and Harborview Medical 
Centers from 2000 to 2016 who had a kidney biopsy showing anti-GBM disease 
characterized by crescentic glomerulonephritis with strong linear staining of 
glomerular basement membranes for IgG by immunofluorescence were included. 
Subjects were classified into anti-GBM or DP based on serologic testing. 
Information on demographics, clinical presentation, biopsy findings, initial 
treatment, and rates of relapse and patient and renal survival were collected. 
Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U and 
Fisher's exact tests, respectively.
RESULTS: There were 6 anti-GBM and 7 DP patients. Two patients were lost to 
follow-up after one year. There was no significant difference in clinical 
presentation or outcomes between the two groups. Two DP patients had greater 
than 50% global glomerulosclerosis. All the subjects developed ESRD. Two DP 
patients had a relapse while off immunosuppression. Two patients in each group 
died within 5 years of diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Two DP patients in our cohort had a relapse within 5 years of 
diagnosis. Multicenter studies are needed to determine whether DP patients have 
a higher relapse rate and need prolonged immunosuppression.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The association between the intake of polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (PUFAs) and the risk of preclinical and clinical type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) in children has generated conflicting results. Thus, we aimed to evaluate 
the definite effects of PUFAs on the risk of preclinical and clinical T1D.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Three databases were systematically searched up to July 18, 
2017 to identify relevant observational studies, without language restriction. 
Any study included should report the risk of preclinical or clinical T1D in 
children with PUFAs supplementation compared with the controls, and report 
relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) or provide data for estimation. Pooled 
RRs (or ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using 
random-effects models irrespective of statistical heterogeneity assessed by I2 
statistic.
RESULTS: We identified seven studies (three prospective cohort studies and four 
case-control studies) on PUFAs intake during pregnancy or during early life in 
children. The pooled RR between the risk of preclinical T1D and n-3 PUFAs 
supplementation against controls was 0.98 (95%CI, 0.85-1.13), with no 
heterogeneity. The results were similar after the intake during pregnancy, but 
not during early life in children (pooled RR, 0.45; 95%CI, 0.21-0.96; 
P = 0.039). N-3 PUFAs supplementation was not associated with a significant 
reduction in the risk of clinical T1D in children (pooled RR, 0.87; 95%CI, 
0.71-1.08), with substantial heterogeneity(I2 = 64.7%). No association was also 
found between n-6 PUFAs intake and the risk of preclinical (1.07; 0.97-1.017) or 
clinical T1D (1.05; 0.92-1.20) in children.
CONCLUSIONS: The result of the meta-analysis does not support that n-3 or n-6 
PUFAs supplementation in children affects the overall risk of preclinical or 
clinical T1D. However, n-3 PUFAs intake in early life might reduce the risk of 
preclinical T1D. Therefore, this finding should be verified by more and 
well-designed prospective research in the future.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of new disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for 
remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has considerably transformed the 
landscape of therapeutic opportunities for this chronic disabling disease. 
Unlike injectable drugs, oral DMTs promote patient satisfaction and increase 
therapeutic adherence.
REVIEW: This article reviews the salient features about the mode of action, 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of approved oral DMTs in RRMS, and 
reviews their place in clinical algorithms in the Middle East and North Africa 
(MENA) region. A systematic review was conducted using a comprehensive search of 
MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (period January 1, 
1995-January 31, 2018). Additional searches of the American Academy of Neurology 
and European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis 
abstracts from 2012-2017 were performed, in addition to searches of the Food and 
Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, to obtain relevant 
safety information on these DMTs.
CONCLUSIONS: Four oral DMTs: fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, and 
cladribine have been approved by the regulatory agencies. Based on the number 
needed to treat (NNT), the potential role of these DMTs in the management of 
active and highly active or rapidly evolving RRMS is assessed. Finally, the 
place of the oral DMTs in clinical algorithms in the MENA region is reviewed.

OBJECTIVES: To assess performance of shear wave elastography for evaluation of 
fibrosis and the histologic stage in patients with autoimmune liver disease 
(ALD) and to validate previously established advanced fibrosis cutoff values in 
this cohort.
METHODS: Shear wave elastography was performed on patients with ALD with an 
Aixplorer ultrasound system (SuperSonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France) using 
an SC6-1 transducer. The median estimated tissue Young modulus was calculated 
from sets of 8 to 10 elastograms. A blinded, subspecialty-trained pathologist 
reviewed biopsy specimens. The METAVIR classification was used to stage liver 
fibrosis and necroinflammation. Steatosis was graded from 0 to 4+. The Kendall 
τ-b correlation test was performed to identify the correlation between the 
estimated tissue Young modulus and fibrosis, steatosis, and the 
necroinflammatory score. The Spearman correlation test was performed to identify 
the correlation between the estimated tissue Young modulus and clinical data. 
The diagnostic performance of shear wave elastography for differentiating 
METAVIR stage F2 or higher from F0 and F1 fibrosis was evaluated by a receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with ALD were analyzed. The estimated tissue Young 
modulus was positively correlated with the fibrosis stage and necroinflammation 
score (r = 0.386; P < .001; r = 0.338; P = .002, respectively) but not steatosis 
(r = -0.091; P = .527). Serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine 
aminotransferase, and total bilirubin values were positively correlated with the 
estimated tissue Young modulus (r = 0.501; P < .001; r = 0.44; P = .001; 
r = 0.291; P = .038). The serum albumin value was negatively correlated 
(r = -0.309; P = .033). The area under the ROC curve was 0.781 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.641-0.921) for distinguishing F2 or greater fibrosis from F0 and F1 
fibrosis. Based on the ROC curve, an optimal cutoff value of 9.15 kPa was 
identified (sensitivity, 83.3%; specificity, 72.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Shear wave elastography is a novel noninvasive adjunct to liver 
biopsy in evaluation and staging of patients with ALD, showing the potential for 
serial evaluations of disease progression and treatment responses.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Concomitant neurologic manifestations and positive 
antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) have been investigated in different manners. 
The present study aimed to investigate the association between neurologic 
manifestations and APAs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 
100 consecutive patients with selected neurological manifestations and at least 
one positive APAs within the age range of 20-50 years, referred to the Rheumatic 
Diseases Research Center from the Northeast Central Neurology Department of Iran 
during August 2012 to March 2014.
RESULTS: According to the results, 89% of the participants were persistently 
positive for APAs, including lupus anticoagulant, IgG anticardiolipin (aCL), IgM 
aCL, IgG β-2 glycoprotein 1 (β2- GP1), and IgM β2-GP1, observed in 16%, 41%, 
42%, 17%, and 15% of the patients, respectively. Furthermore, 10% of the 
patients had concomitant lupus manifestations, and 37% of them showed anti-DNA. 
The IgG and IgM aCL were the most prevalent antibodies. Cerebral vascular 
accident (33%), retinal artery/vein occlusion (21%), and seizure (20%) were the 
most frequent presentations among the patients. In addition, the patients with 
multiple sclerosis (composing 3% of the subjects) were 100% positive for IgG and 
IgM aCL, as well as lupus anticoagulant. In addition, IgM anti-β2- GP1 was 100% 
positive in optic neuritis patients (composing 5% of the subjects) and was 
significantly associated with this neurologic disorder. IgM anti-β2-GP1 was also 
prevalent in the cases with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The most prevalent 
persistently positive antibody in the patients with cerebrovascular accident was 
IgM aCL.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study revealed some associations between the 
subtypes of APAs and incidence of neurologic disorders. However, the exact 
correlation between those symptoms and APAs needs further investigations.

Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of many complex diseases 
and disorders including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, 
neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular pathologies. Prostaglandins play 
a regulatory role in inflammation. Cyclooxygenases are the main mediators of 
inflammation by catalyzing the initial step of arachidonic acid metabolism and 
prostaglandin synthesis. The differential expression of the constitutive isoform 
COX-1 and the inducible isoform COX-2, and the finding that COX-1 is the major 
form expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, lead to the search for 
COX-2-selective inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents that might diminish the 
gastrointestinal side effects of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs). COX-2 isoform is expressed predominantly in inflammatory cells 
and decidedly upregulated in chronic and acute inflammations, becoming a 
critical target for many pharmacological inhibitors. COX-2 selective inhibitors 
happen to show equivalent efficacy with that of conventional NSAIDs, but they 
have reduced gastrointestinal side effects. This review would elucidate the most 
recent findings on selective COX-2 inhibition and their relevance to human 
pathology, concretely in inflammatory pathologies characterized by a prolonged 
pro-inflammatory status, including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, 
obesity, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, arthritis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease and 
cardiovascular pathologies.

The artificial pancreas combines a hormone infusion pump with a continuous 
glucose monitoring device, supported by a dosing algorithm currently installed 
on the pump. It allows for dynamic infusions of insulin (and possibly other 
hormones such as glucagon) tailored to patient needs. For patients with type 1 
diabetes the artificial pancreas has been shown to prevent more effectively 
hypoglycaemic events and hyperglycaemia than insulin pump therapy and has the 
potential to simplify care. However, the potential ethical issues associated 
with the upcoming integration of the artificial pancreas into clinical practice 
have not yet been discussed. Our objective was to identify and articulate 
ethical issues associated with artificial pancreas use for patients, healthcare 
professionals, industry and policymakers. We performed a literature review to 
identify clinical, psychosocial and technical issues raised by the artificial 
pancreas and subsequently analysed them through a common bioethics framework. We 
identified five sensitive domains of ethical issues. Patient confidentiality and 
safety can be jeopardized by the artificial pancreas' vulnerability to security 
breaches or unauthorized data sharing. Public and private coverage of the 
artificial pancreas could be cost-effective and warranted. Patient selection 
criteria need to ensure equitable access and sensitivity to patient-reported 
outcomes. Patient coaching and support by healthcare professionals or industry 
representatives could help foster realistic expectations in patients. Finally, 
the artificial pancreas increases the visibility of diabetes and could generate 
issues related to personal identity and patient agency. The timely consideration 
of these issues will optimize the technological development and clinical uptake 
of the artificial pancreas.

AIM: Elevated levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody may 
spontaneously normalise in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, even 
if they eat gluten. The prevalence of this phenomenon and predictors of a 
subsequent coeliac disease (CD) diagnosis were determined.
METHODS: The medical records of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 
Ha'Emek Medical Centre, Israel, from 2007 to 2015, were retrospectively reviewed 
for elevated anti-tTG antibody levels. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and 
histological findings were compared between CD patients and those with transient 
coeliac serology.
RESULTS: Of 425 patients with new onset type 1 diabetes, 34 (8%) had elevated 
anti-tTG antibodies: CD was diagnosed in 14, anti-tTG normalisation occurred in 
13 and duodenal biopsies did not suggest CD in seven without anti-tTG antibody 
normalisation. Protective factors for a subsequent CD diagnosis were older age 
(p = 0.009) and mildly elevated anti-tTG antibody levels at the time of the type 
1 diabetes diagnosis (p = 0.007), and decreased anti-tTG levels within six 
months of diagnosis (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Serological follow-up of a diet containing gluten is recommended for 
children who have newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and slightly elevated anti-tTG 
antibodies with no symptoms that suggest CD.

Blood Glucose Among People With Type 1 Diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring of blood glucose helps people with type 1 diabetes 
to maintain glycemic control and reduce the risk of complications. However, 
adherence to blood glucose monitoring is often suboptimal.
PURPOSE: Like many health behaviors, self-monitoring of blood glucose involves 
exerting effort in the present to achieve future benefits. As such, the present 
research explored whether individual differences in time 
perspective-specifically, the extent to which people have a balanced time 
perspective-are associated with the frequency with which people with type 1 
diabetes monitor their blood glucose and, thus, maintain glycemic control.
METHODS: Adults with type 1 diabetes completed measures of time perspective, 
feelings associated with monitoring, attitudes toward monitoring, and trait 
self-control. Objective data regarding the frequency with which participants 
monitored their blood glucose levels and their long-term glycemic control were 
extracted from their medical records.
RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses and tests of indirect effects (N = 
129) indicated that having a more balanced time perspective was associated with 
more frequent monitoring of blood glucose and, as a result, better glycemic 
control. Further analyses (N = 158) also indicated that there was an indirect 
relationship between balanced time perspective and monitoring of blood glucose 
via the feelings that participants associated with monitoring and their 
subsequent attitudes toward monitoring.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to the importance and relevance of time 
perspective for understanding health-related behavior and may help to inform 
interventions designed to promote self-monitoring of blood glucose in people 
with type 1 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory 
disease which can cause significant disability, morbidity, mortality, and 
impaired fertility. It commonly affects women of childbearing age. Managing 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the perinatal period poses challenges. There is 
concern about the teratogenic effects of many traditional disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and an ever-growing list of new therapeutic 
options with limited data in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
AIMS: We aimed to create a standardized approach to pharmacological management 
of RA patients seen in our newly established Rheumatology and Reproductive 
Health Service.
METHODS: We reviewed relevant publications on the use of anti-rheumatic drugs in 
pregnancy. These include recent guidelines from The British Society for 
Rheumatology (BSR) and British Health Professionals in Rheumatology (BHPR) and 
the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).
RESULTS: After considering relevant publications, we developed a Saint Vincent's 
University Hospital/National Maternity Hospital consensus protocol for 
evidence-based medication in pregnancy in RA.
CONCLUSIONS: RA tends to improve during pregnancy and flare postpartum. Several 
anti-rheumatic medication options during pregnancy and breastfeeding are now 
available including anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents. Good disease 
control at all stages of reproduction is important to ensure best outcome for 
both mother and baby.

OBJECTIVE: Different viral exposures have been implicated in the etiology of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Evidence relating to the association between putative 
viral exposures and the development of RA was reviewed.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE-OVID, 
EMBASE-OVID, PUBMED and Cochrane library databases. Articles were included if 
they were case-controls, cross-sectional or cohort studies and were published in 
English. Case-series were included if there was a lack of other study designs.
RESULTS: Of 6724 citations, 48 were included in meta-analysis. Studies had poor 
quality. PBV19 infection was increased in RA compared to controls [N = 12, odds 
ratio (OR) 1.77 (95% CI: 1.11; 2.80) p = 0.02 for PVB19 IgG]. IgG anti-EBNA 
antibodies were not increased in RA (N = 17, p = 0.75), but anti-VCA [N = 18, OR 
1.5 (95% CI: 1.07; 2.10), p = 0.02] and anti-EA antibodies [N = 11, OR 2.74 (95% 
CI: 1.27; 5.94), p = 0.01] were increased in RA. CMV was not associated with RA 
(N = 13, p = 0.42), nor was HBV (N = 5, p = 0.09). HCV was associated with RA in 
7 case-control studies [OR 2.82 (95% CI: 1.35; 5.90), p = 0.006] and one cohort 
study [hazard ratio (HR) 2.03 (95% CI: 1.27, 3.22), p < 0.01]. Persistent 
arthritis was increased after Chikungunya fever [N = 2, OR 90 (95% CI: 15.2, 
134.3), p = 0.047].
CONCLUSIONS: Studies of RA after viral exposures have poor quality. There is a 
risk of RA after Parvo B19, HCV and possibly EBV infection. CMV and HBV 
infections are not associated with RA. CHIKV is associated with the persistent 
inflammatory arthritis.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term effect of B-cell depletion therapy with 
Rituximab (RTX) alone as rescue therapy in primary antiphospholipid syndrome 
(PAPS) patients with severe thrombocytopenia.
METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data from patients who met the following 
inclusion criteria: (a) persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) positivity 
and fulfilled the Sydney criteria for PAPS (b) presented with severe 
thrombocytopenia (platelets <50,000/mm3) (c) were treated with RTX as a rescue 
therapy (d) had at least 1 year of follow-up after B-cells depletion therapy.
RESULTS: This retrospective study included 6 consecutive female PAPS patients 
[median age 49.5 (range 38-66)] who presented with severe thrombocytopenia 
(platelets <50,000/mm3, mean value 31,000 ± 9000/mm3). We observed a full 
response (defined as >150,000 platelets/mm3) after treatment with RTX in 5 out 
of 6 patients (83.3%). Among responders, after a median follow-up of more than 4 
years, we observed a median time free from relapse of 43 months (range 12-97). 
One patient did not respond to the B-cell depletion therapy and was treated with 
a splenectomy 1 month after RTX therapy and platelets levels normalized after 3 
months. No adverse events were reported, no patients developed significant 
infections. Importantly, the patients required no further maintenance therapy 
for the thrombocytopenia.
CONCLUSION: In one of the longest-term observational (median 43 months) studies, 
sustained clinical remission of severe thrombocytopenia without 
immunosuppressive maintenance therapy was obtained by RTX alone in patients with 
PAPS and severe thrombocytopenia intolerant or refractory to conventional 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: There is no consensus regarding the minimum number of joints that 
should be included in an ultrasound (US) scoring system to reliably assess for 
disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
PURPOSE: To assess whether simplified US protocols for hand examination are as 
informative as the examination of 22 joints in patients with RA, and to 
correlate the US parameters with disease activity (DAS-28).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 224 RA patients 
stratified based on their DAS-28 scores and assessed using eight preselected US 
examination protocols, including 22, 18, 16, 14, ten, eight, and two different 
combinations of four joints, respectively.
RESULTS: We found a significant difference between US hand scores regarding 
their ability to detect active inflammation and erosions. DAS-28 scores 
correlated very well with the power Doppler (PD) scores generated by all eight 
US examination protocols (r = 0.89-1, P < 0.05), irrespective of patients' 
disease activity. Simplified US scores missed information on presence of PD in 
20.6-40.2% patients ( P < 0.05) and misdiagnosed non-erosive hand RA in 12-38.4% 
patients ( P < 0.05), depending on the number of joints excluded from US hand 
examination.
CONCLUSION: Preselected simplified US scores are less reliable in appreciating 
the disease burden when compared with an extended protocol for 22 joint US 
examination, raising clinicians' awareness regarding the need to comprehensively 
assess multiple hand joints to reliably rule out subclinical inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolic and immunologic factors associated with 
the presence of central arterial stiffness as measured by the augmentation index 
(AIx).
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 69 female patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared with a control group of 34 healthy 
women. The anthropometrical variables, the vascular studies, and the analytic 
data were obtained the same day. The AIx was assessed by peripheral arterial 
tonometry. The analysis of lipoprotein populations was performed using nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
RESULTS: Arterial stiffness was increased in patients with SLE compared with 
control subjects (mean ± SD 20.30 ± 21.54% versus 10.84 ± 11.51%; P = 0.0021). 
Values for the AIx were correlated with the Framingham risk score (r = 0.481, P 
< 0.001), carotid intima-media thickness (r = 0.503, P < 0.001), systolic blood 
pressure (r = 0.270, P < 0.001), and age (r = 0.365, P < 0.001). Patients 
receiving antimalarial drugs had a lower AIx (mean ± SD 11.74 ± 11.28% versus 
24.97 ± 20.63%; P = 0.024). The AIx was correlated with the atherogenic 
lipoproteins analyzed by NMR. The immunologic variables associated with the AIx 
were C4 (r = 0.259, P = 0.046) and IgM anti-β2 -glycoprotein I (IgM anti-β2 GPI) 
(r = 0.284, P = 0.284). In the multivariate analysis, age (β = 0.347, 95% 
confidence interval [95% CI] 0.020-0.669, P = 0.035), IgM β2 GPI (β = 0.321, 95% 
CI 0.024-0.618, P = 0.035) and small dense high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
particles (β = 1.288, 95% CI 0.246-2.329, P = 0.017) predicted the AIx.
CONCLUSION: SLE patients had increased arterial stiffness compared with healthy 
control subjects. Arterial stiffness was decreased in patients treated with 
antimalarial drugs. Age, IgM β2 GPI, and the number of small dense HDL particles 
predicted the AIx.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether obesity in women with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) is independently associated with worse patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs).
METHODS: Data were derived from a prospective study of adult women with a 
diagnosis of SLE that was verified by medical record review. Two established 
definitions for obesity were used: fat mass index (FMI) ≥13 kg/m2 and body mass 
index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 . Dependent variables included 4 validated PROs: disease 
activity as assessed by the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ), 
depressive symptoms as assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D), pain as assessed by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) pain 
subscale, and fatigue as assessed by the SF-36 vitality subscale. We used 
multivariable linear regression to evaluate the associations of obesity with 
PROs, while controlling for potential confounders (age, race, education, income, 
smoking, disease duration, disease damage, and prednisone use).
RESULTS: The analysis included 148 participants, 32% of whom were obese. In the 
multivariate regression model, obesity was associated with worse scores for each 
PRO. Mean adjusted scores for the SLAQ and CES-D comparing obese versus 
non-obese participants were 14.8 versus 11.5 (P = 0.01) and 19.8 versus 13.1 (P 
< 0.01), respectively. The obese group also reported worse mean adjusted scores 
for pain (38.7 versus 44.2; P < 0.01) and fatigue (39.6 versus 45.2; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: In a representative sample of women with SLE, obesity (as defined by 
both FMI and BMI) was independently associated with worse PROs, including 
disease activity, depressive symptoms, and symptoms of pain and fatigue. Obesity 
may represent a modifiable target for improving outcomes among obese women with 
SLE.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most prevalent glomerular disease worldwide and is 
associated with a poor prognosis. Development of curative treatment strategies 
and approaches for early diagnosis is necessary. Renal biopsy is the gold 
standard for the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity. However, reliable 
biomarkers are needed for the noninvasive diagnosis of this disease and to more 
fully delineate the risk of progression. With regard to the pathogenesis of 
IgAN, the multi-hit hypothesis, including production of galactose-deficient IgA1 
(Gd-IgA1; Hit 1), IgG or IgA autoantibodies that recognize Gd-IgA1 (Hit 2), and 
their subsequent immune complexes formation (Hit 3) and glomerular deposition 
(Hit 4), has been widely supported by many studies. Although the prognostic 
values of several biomarkers have been discussed, we recently developed a highly 
sensitive and specific diagnostic method by measuring serum levels of Gd-IgA1 
and Gd-IgA1-containing immune complexes. In addition, urinary Gd-IgA1 may 
represent a disease-specific biomarker for IgAN. We also confirmed that there is 
a significant correlation between serum levels of these effector molecules and 
disease activity, suggesting that each can be considered a practical surrogate 
marker of therapeutic response. Thus, these disease-oriented specific serum and 
urine biomarkers may be useful for screening of potential IgAN with isolated 
hematuria, earlier diagnosis, disease activity, and eventually, response to 
treatment. In this review, we discuss these concepts, with a focus on potential 
clinical applications of these biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells characterized by 
immunomodulatory properties and are therefore considered a promising tool for 
the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate 
whether transplantation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) affects the 
autoimmune pathogenesis in MRL/lpr mice.
METHODS: Fifteen 12-week-old MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided into three 
groups: ADSC, cyclophosphamide (CTX), and control groups, with five mice in each 
group. ADSC and control groups were injected with 1 × 106 ADSCs or PBS, 
respectively, via the tail vein, once a week for 8 weeks. The CTX group was 
injected with CTX at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight, once a week for 2 weeks, 
and this was repeated after 2 weeks rest. Proteinuria, anti-double-stranded DNA 
(anti-dsDNA) antibody, and serum creatinine levels were then measured. The 
populations of Th17 and Treg cells in the spleen were detected by flow 
cytometry. All statistical analyses were performed using least square 
difference.
RESULTS: Eight weeks after treatment, the 24 h proteinuria, anti-dsDNA antibody 
levels, and serum creatinine were decreased significantly with transplantation 
of mouse ADSCs. ADSCs markedly reduced the number of TH17 cells, increased Treg 
cells, and improved renal pathology.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that transplantation of ADSCs could 
significantly inhibit autoimmune progression in MRL/lpr mice and the efficacy of 
ADSCs was comparable to that of CTX.

There are national and international clinical practice guidelines for systemic 
lupus erythematosus treatment. Nonetheless, most of them are not designed for 
the Mexican population or are devoted only to the treatment of certain disease 
manifestations, like lupus nephritis, or are designed for some physiological 
state like pregnancy. The Mexican College of Rheumatology aimed to create 
clinical practice guidelines that included the majority of the manifestations of 
systemic lupus erythematosus, and also incorporated guidelines in controversial 
situations like vaccination and the perioperative period. The present document 
introduces the «Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus» proposed by the Mexican College of Rheumatology, which could be 
useful mostly for non-rheumatologist physicians who need to treat patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus without having the appropriate training in the 
field of rheumatology. In these guidelines, the reader will find recommendations 
on the management of general, articular, kidney, cardiovascular, pulmonary, 
neurological, hematologic and gastrointestinal manifestations, and 
recommendations on vaccination and treatment management during the perioperative 
period.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The provision of medical care to young adults with type 1 
diabetes mellitus is challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the 
rates of microvascular complications and their progression among patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus attending a specialist young adult diabetes service in 
Ireland.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 62 (male 56.5%) patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus attending the young adult diabetes service at our institution was 
undertaken. Data was recorded across two time points, clinic registration and at 
5 years following initial contact.
RESULTS: The mean ± SD age at first attendance was 17.4 ± 2.0 years. Mean ± SD 
duration of diabetes was 6.3 ± 3.9 years with most patients treated using 
multiple daily insulin injections (75.8%). diabetic retinopathy rate at first 
attendance was 17.7% and after 5 years was 37.1% (p = 0.003). The majority of 
cases were background retinopathy. The prevalence of diabetic kidney disease was 
6.4% and this remained unchanged at follow-up. Mean ± SD HbA1c improved from 
76.1 ± 22.4 mmol/mol (9.1 ± 4.2%) to 69.1 ± 14.9 mmol/mol (8.5 ± 3.5%), 
p = 0.044. Duration of diabetes was the only clinical variable associated with 
retinopathy risk at 5 years on multiple regression analysis (p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic retinopathy is prevalent in young adults with type 1 
diabetes attending specialist secondary care diabetes services. Duration of 
diabetes was the strongest determinant of retinopathy risk.

OBJECTIVES: In fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (fT1DM), plasma glucose (PG) 
levels are strongly increased, unlike glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels, 
resulting in a sharply increased PG/HbA1C ratio. We investigated the PG/HbA1C 
ratio in fT1DM and tested the accuracy of cutoff points to easily and 
efficiently differentiate fT1DM from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
METHODS: We report 41 cases of fT1DM in which PG/HbA1C ratio was studied as a 
novel clinical parameter to predict fT1DM. Clinical and biochemical 
characteristics were analyzed in 41 fT1DM and 51 DKA patients in China. 
Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to identify PG/HbA1C 
ratio cutoff points to differentiate fT1DM from DKA.
RESULTS: PG/HbA1C ratio was significantly higher in fT1DM patients 
(7.24±2.49mmol/L/%; i.e., 0.88±0.36L/mol) than in DKA patients 
(2.60±0.69mmol/L/%; i.e., 0.06±0.01L/mol) (P<0.001). PG/HbA1C ratio exceeded 
4.2mmol/L/% (i.e., 0.6 l/mol) in 39 of the 41 fT1DM patients (95.1%), versus 
only 1 of the 51 DKA patients (1.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: PG/HbA1C ratio is a simple tool that may be useful to identify DKA 
patients at high risk of fT1DM. PG/HbA1C ratio with a threshold of≥4.2mmol/L/% 
(i.e., 0.6L/mol) can be adopted as a new clinical parameter in predicting fT1DM.

TMEM173 gene encodes the protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes), a key 
player in host defense against pathogens. Mutations in the human TMEM173 gene 
cause a life-threatening auto-inflammatory disease called SAVI (STING-associated 
vasculopathy with onset in infancy). Human STING is also a promising therapeutic 
target for cancers and infectious diseases. Recently, Aduro Biotech and Novartis 
announced a $250M-plus initiative to develop STING-targeting cancer 
immunotherapies. Thus, understanding the genetics of the human TMEM173 gene is 
important for both basic and translational research. The human TMEM173 gene has 
great heterogeneity and population stratification. R232 of STING is the most 
common human TMEM173 allele. However, >50% of Americans are not R232/R232. HAQ 
(R71H-G230A-R293Q) is the second most common human TMEM173 allele. While 
R232/R232 is the dominant TMEM173 genotype in Europeans, R232/HAQ is the most 
common TMEM173 genotype in East Asians. Importantly, recent studies suggested 
that HAQ and H232 are likely loss-of-function TMEM173 alleles. In all, ~30% of 
East Asians and ~10% of Europeans are HAQ/HAQ, HAQ/H232, or H232/H232. Here, we 
reviewed human TMEM173 alleles, mutations and their potential impact on human 
health and medicine.

AIMS: Little is known about cognition in older adults with type 1 diabetes. The 
aim of this study was to identify correlates of clinically significant cognitive 
impairment.
METHODS: Neuropsychological, diabetes-related and glycemic (HbA1c, Continuous 
Glucose Monitoring; CGM) data were collected from 201 older adults (≥60 years) 
with longstanding type 1 diabetes.
RESULTS: Clinically significant cognitive impairment (≥2 cognitive tests ≥1.5 SD 
below normative data) occurred in 48% of the sample. After controlling for age, 
gender, education and diabetes duration, we found that hypoglycemia unawareness, 
recent severe hypoglycemic events, any microvascular complication, higher HbA1c 
and CGM average nocturnal glucose were all associated with increased odds of 
clinically significant cognitive impairment (ORs = 1.01-2.61), while CGM 
nocturnal % time below 60 mg/dL was associated with a decreased odds of 
cognitive impairment (OR = 0.94). Diabetes duration, diagnosis age, daytime CGM, 
and lifetime severe hypoglycemic events were not related to cognitive impairment 
status.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant cognitive impairment was common in older 
adults with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes-related correlates of cognitive impairment 
were identified, including hypoglycemia unawareness, recent severe hypoglycemic 
events, and CGM variables. Longitudinal research is needed to determine if these 
variables predict cognitive decline and if their modification alters outcomes.

Methotrexate (MTX), the anchor drug in the current treatment strategy for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), was first approved for treatment of RA in Japan in 
1999 at the recommended dose of 6-8 mg/week; it was approved as first-line drug 
with the maximum dose of 16 mg/week in February 2011. However, more than half of 
Japanese patients with RA are unable to tolerate a dose of 16 mg/week of MTX. 
Moreover, some serious adverse events during the treatment with MTX, such as 
pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) have been 
observed much more frequently in Japan than in other countries. Therefore, this 
article, an abridged English translation summarizing the 2016 update of the 
Japan College of Rheumatology (JCR) guideline for the use of MTX in Japanese 
patients with RA, is not intended to be valid for global use; however, it is 
helpful for the Japanese community of rheumatology and its understanding might 
be useful to the global community of rheumatology.

The prognosis of patients with allograft IgA nephropathy (IgAN) requires further 
investigation. We performed a bicenter retrospective cohort study on kidney 
transplant recipients diagnosed with IgAN in allograft biopsy. Recipients 
without allograft IgAN but with known IgAN before transplantation were included 
as the control group. We investigated the associations between 
clinicopathological characteristics, including allograft crescents, and the risk 
of death-censored graft failure. In total, 1256 IgAN patients in both pre- and 
posttransplant stages were included. Among them, 559 were diagnosed with 
allograft IgAN, which was a time-dependent risk factor for worse prognosis 
(adjusted hazard ratio = 5.009 [3.610-6.951]; P < .001) during a median of 
8.1 years of follow-up. Of the patients with allograft IgAN, 88 (15.9%) had 
glomerular crescents, including 40 patients (7.2%) with >10% crescent formation 
in the total biopsied glomeruli. The presence of glomerular crescents in IgAN 
was associated with a worse graft prognosis, and the association was still valid 
with the C scores of the current Oxford classification. In conclusion, allograft 
IgAN is a time-dependent event and is associated with worse graft outcomes. The 
pathological characteristics of allograft, particularly the degree of glomerular 
crescent formation, may represent important risk factors for a poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: In anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated 
glomerulonephritis, antigen specificity varies between myeloperoxidase (MPO) and 
proteinase 3 (PR3). This has been reported to vary in relation to age, gender, 
geography and extrarenal manifestations. However, studies are difficult to 
compare as criteria for inclusion vary. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the relationship between ANCA serotype, latitude, ultraviolet (UV) radiation 
levels, age, gender and renal function at diagnosis in a large study with 
uniform inclusion criteria.
METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis were 
identified from regional or nationwide registries in 14 centres in Norway, 
Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Italy and the USA during the period 
2000-13. UV radiation levels for 2000-13 in Europe were obtained from the 
Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.
RESULTS: A total of 1408 patients (45.2% PR3-ANCA) were included in the study. 
In univariable analysis, PR3-ANCA was significantly associated with male gender 
{odds ratio [OR] 2.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.71-2.62]}, younger age [OR 
per year 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.98)] and higher glomerular filtration rate [OR per 
mL/min 1.01 (95% CI 1.01-1.02); P < 0.001] at diagnosis but not with latitude or 
UV radiation. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, latitude and UV 
radiation also became significant, with higher odds for PR3-ANCA positivity at 
northern latitudes/lower UV radiation levels. However, the latitudinal 
difference in MPO:PR3 ratio is smaller than differences previously reported 
concerning microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The ratio between PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA varies in 
glomerulonephritis with respect to age, gender, renal function and geographic 
latitude/UV radiation levels.

OBJECTIVES: Krenn synovitis Score has been developed by Krenn et al. in order to 
assess synovitis severity and is used in synovial research. Cell signature of 
synovial tissue can be studied using immunohistochemistry and is of interest as 
a biomarker for both prognosis and prediction of response to treatment. However, 
no synovitis score including immunohistochemistry exists yet. In order to answer 
this unmet need, we propose a new Immunologic Synovitis score (IMSYC) adding 5 
components to the Krenn score: CD68, CD3, CD20, CD31 and Ki67 immunostaining. In 
this study, we aimed to validate this new IMSYC by studying its diagnostic 
performances in a well-defined collection of synovial samples.
METHODS: Synovial samples from patients were obtained during surgical 
procedures. CD68, CD3, CD20, CD31 and KI67 immunohistochemistry were performed.
RESULTS: In total, 77 patients were included. In total, 45 were females, mean 
age was 63.1 years. Forty had inflammatory arthritis, mainly rheumatoid 
arthritis (31/40). Non inflammatory arthritis group included 35 patients with 
mainly osteoarthritis. Mean Krenn score and IMSYC were significantly higher in 
the inflammatory group (P<0.001). ROC analysis of diagnostic performances 
determined the score of 13.5 out of 24 as the cut-off that gave the best ratio 
for discrimination between inflammatory and non-inflammatory arthritis with a 
sensitivity of 71.8% and specificity of 98%.
CONCLUSION: We propose a new synovitis score including immunohistochemistry. 
This score has a better sensitivity and specificity than the Krenn score and 
represents a more functional synovitis evaluation. IMSYC could be further used 
in better categorizing synovial tissue phenotype and give a basis for tissue 
driven therapy.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: An association between long-term use of proton pump 
inhibitors and the development of gastric neuroendocrine tumors has been 
reported, but it is still a subject of debate. The aims of the present study 
were to determine the presence of this association in a Mexican population and 
to identify the risk factors for developing gastric neuroendocrine tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted, in which the cases 
were patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of gastric neuroendocrine tumor 
and the controls were patients evaluated through upper endoscopy. The controls 
were paired by age, sex, and endoscopic examination indication. Proton pump 
inhibitor use was considered prolonged when consumption was longer than 5 years.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with gastric neuroendocrine tumor and 66 controls 
were included in the study. Eighteen (54.5%) patients in the case group were 
women, as were 39 (59%) of the patients in the control group. The median age of 
the patients in the case group was 55 years (minimum-maximum range: 24-82) and 
it was 54 years (minimum-maximum range:18-85) in the control group. A greater 
number of patients in the gastric neuroendocrine tumor group presented with 
gastric atrophy (p<0.0001) and autoimmune atrophic gastritis (p=0.0002), 
compared with the control group. No association between gastric neuroendocrine 
tumor and prolonged proton pump inhibitor use, sex, smoking, gastroesophageal 
reflux disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, diabetes mellitus, or autoimmune 
diseases was found in the univariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study showed no association between proton pump 
inhibitor use for more than 5 years and the development of gastric 
neuroendocrine tumor. The presence of gastric atrophy and autoimmune atrophic 
gastritis was associated with gastric neuroendocrine tumor development.

BACKGROUND: Symptom severity is negatively associated with physical activity in 
multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it is unclear how physical activity and 
symptoms correlate on a day-to-day basis in persons with MS.
PURPOSE: To determine the temporal within-person associations of pain, fatigue, 
depressed mood, and perceived cognitive function with physical activity in MS.
METHODS: Ambulatory adults with MS (N = 107) completed 7 days of home 
monitoring. Continuous physical activity data (assessed via wrist-worn 
accelerometer) and concurrent ecological momentary assessment (5X/day) of pain, 
fatigue, depressed mood, and perceived cognitive function were collected. Data 
were analyzed using multilevel mixed modeling.
RESULTS: Fatigue and depressed mood demonstrated bidirectional associations with 
physical activity, whereas pain and cognitive function did not. Higher than 
usual fatigue (B = -5.83, p = .001) and depressed mood (B = -4.12, p = .03) were 
followed by decreased physical activity. In contrast, higher than usual physical 
activity was associated with subsequent decline in fatigue (B = -0.001, p = .02) 
and depressed mood (B = -0.0007, p = .02); however, the association between 
physical activity and fatigue varied across the day.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity is dynamically related to fatigue and mood on a 
moment-to-moment basis in MS. Efforts to increase physical activity in MS must 
incorporate a focus on how symptoms affect and are affected by activity.

OBJECTIVE: Optimal targeted treatment in rheumatoid arthritis requires early 
identification of failure to respond. This post hoc analysis explored the 
relationship between early disease activity changes and the achievement of low 
disease activity (LDA) and remission targets with tofacitinib.
METHODS: Data were from 2 randomized, double-blind, phase III studies. In the 
ORAL Start trial, methotrexate (MTX)-naive patients received tofacitinib 5 or 
10 mg twice daily, or MTX, for 24 months. In the placebo-controlled ORAL 
Standard trial, MTX inadequate responder patients received tofacitinib 5 or 10 
mg twice daily or adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks, with MTX, for 12 months. 
Probabilities of achieving LDA (using a Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI] 
score ≤10 or the 4-component Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate [DAS28-ESR] ≤3.2) at months 6 and 12 were 
calculated, given failure to achieve threshold improvement from baseline (change 
in CDAI ≥6 or DAS28-ESR ≥1.2) at month 1 or 3.
RESULTS: In ORAL Start, 7.2% and 5.4% of patients receiving tofacitinib 5 and 10 
mg twice daily, respectively, failed to show improvement in the CDAI ≥6 at month 
3; of those who failed, 3.8% and 28.6%, respectively, achieved month 6 
CDAI-defined LDA. In ORAL Standard, 18.8% and 17.5% of patients receiving 
tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg twice daily, respectively, failed to improve CDAI ≥6 at 
month 3; of those who failed, 0% and 2.9%, respectively, achieved month 6 
CDAI-defined LDA. Findings were similar when considering improvements at month 1 
or DAS28-ESR thresholds.
CONCLUSION: In patients with an inadequate response to MTX, lack of response to 
tofacitinib after 1 or 3 months predicted a low probability of achieving LDA at 
month 6. Lack of an early response may be considered when deciding whether to 
continue treatment with tofacitinib.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a moderate-to-high-intensity, aerobic and 
resistance exercise with person-centered guidance in older adults with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), through a randomized controlled multicenter trial.
METHODS: Older adults (ages 65-75 years) with RA (n = 74) were randomized to 
either a 20-week exercise intervention at a gym (n = 36) or to home-based 
exercise of light intensity (n = 38). Assessments were performed at baseline, at 
20 weeks, and at 12 months. The primary outcome was the difference in the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ DI) score, and the secondary 
outcomes were the differences in physical fitness assessed by a cardiopulmonary 
exercise test, an endurance test, the timed up and go test, the sit to stand 
test, and an isometric elbow flexion force measurement.
RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups were found for the 
primary outcome, HAQ DI score. Within the intervention group there was a 
significant improvement in the HAQ DI score when compared to baseline (P = 
0.022). Aerobic capacity (P < 0.001) and 3 of 4 additional performance-based 
tests of endurance and strength significantly improved (P < 0.05) in the 
intervention group when compared to the control group. In the intervention 
group, 71% of patients rated their health as much or very much improved compared 
to 24% of patients in the control group (P < 0.001). At the 12-month follow-up, 
there were no significant differences in change between the 2 groups on the HAQ 
DI score. A significant between-group difference was found for change in an 
endurance test (P = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: Aerobic and resistance exercise with person-centered guidance 
improved physical fitness in terms of aerobic capacity, endurance, and strength 
in older adults with RA.

BACKGROUND: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is associated with multiple comorbid 
conditions, including cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities that impose a 
considerable burden on patients. Effective management of PsA requires an 
understanding of comorbidity profiles.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency and incidence rates of comorbidities and 
hospitalizations among newly diagnosed PsA patients and a matched general 
population without PsA, using large national claims databases in the United 
States.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study used MarketScan databases from 
January 1, 2008, to September 30, 2015, to identify adult patients with newly 
diagnosed PsA (i.e., no PsA diagnosis during the 1 year before the first 
observed PsA diagnosis). The earliest date of PsA diagnosis was defined as the 
index date. Patients with no PsA diagnosis any time during the study period 
(controls) were directly matched to PsA patients with demographic 
characteristics. All patients had ≥ 2 years of medical and pharmacy coverage 
before the index date and ≥ 1 year of follow-up. Incident rates per 100 
person-years for comorbidities of interest were evaluated. The hazard ratios of 
having various comorbid conditions for PsA patients were estimated by Cox 
proportional hazards models. All-cause and CV-related hospitalizations during 
the follow-up period were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 14,898 PsA patients and 35,037 matched controls met the 
study criteria. Compared with controls, PsA patients had a higher risk of CV 
disorders (incidence rate = 6.5 vs. 5.8; HR = 1.46; 95% CI = 1.37-1.56) and a 
higher risk of the majority of the specific CV disorders (hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral 
vascular disease). PsA patients also had a higher risk for any autoimmune 
disease (incidence rate = 8.4 vs. 1.6; HR = 18.26; 95% CI = 17.18-19.40) and 
most autoimmune categories (psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune disorders). Rates of other 
PsA-related comorbidities (diabetes, anxiety, fatigue, smoking, alcohol use, 
obesity or overweight, depression, osteoporosis, uveitis, eczema, and gout) were 
also significantly higher for PsA patients. The all-cause hospitalization rate 
was higher among PsA patients than controls (24.9% vs. 16.2%; P < 0.001). The 
CV-related hospitalization rate varied depending on whether the CV condition was 
the primary discharge diagnosis only or was any diagnosis on the inpatient 
claims. The rates of coronary artery disease hospitalizations were significantly 
higher in PsA patients than in controls with both methods of analysis (primary 
diagnosis: 0.8% vs. 0.5%; P < 0.001; nonprimary diagnosis: 3.2% vs. 2.2%; P < 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective U.S.-based claims study found that PsA patients 
had a high comorbidity burden. Compared with the non-PsA population, PsA 
patients were associated with a higher incidence of CV comorbidities, autoimmune 
diseases, and other PsA-related comorbidities and a higher rate of all-cause and 
CV-related hospitalizations. Understanding these comorbidity profiles may 
provide insight on the effect of comorbid conditions on disease management and 
health care utilization associated with PsA.

BACKGROUND: Acute optic neuritis (ON) is often the first manifestation of 
multiple sclerosis which is particularly common in Ireland. Despite the specific 
clinical details regarding investigations and management of ON provided by the 
Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), international surveys have shown that 
there are still notable differences in the management of ON between neurologists 
and ophthalmologists.
AIM: To compare the investigation and treatment of acute optic neuritis between 
ophthalmologists and neurologists in Ireland METHOD: A survey consisting of a 
case scenario and questions regarding treatment and investigations of a patient 
with ON was emailed to ophthalmology consultants, trainees and medical 
ophthalmologists registered with the Irish College of Ophthalmologists and to 
neurology consultants and registrars registered with the Irish Institute of 
Clinical Neuroscience.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty recipients responded out of 350 (46%). The majority 
of the neurologists would initiate steroid treatment regardless of the patient's 
vision (75%), treat with 1 g IV methylprednisolone (100%) for 5 days (57%), 
perform an MRI brain and orbits with contrast (92%) and multiple laboratory 
tests (96%). In contrast, the ophthalmologists tended to initiate treatment 
depending on the patient's vision (48%), treat with 1 g IV methylprednisolone 
(97%) for 3 days instead of 5 days (93%), perform MRI brain and orbits with 
contrast (73%) and favour electrophysiology testing (73%) over laboratory 
testing (68%).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, most respondents would follow the ONTT guidelines 
regarding IV methylprednisolone. There was a significant difference in responses 
between the ophthalmologists and neurologists regarding who to treat, duration 
of treatment and appropriate investigations.

INTRODUCTION: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is one of the most common endocrine 
diseases in childhood. However, very limited information is available on this 
disease.
OBJECTIVES: This study was done to assess risk factors, clinical features and 
management practices in T1D patients.
METHODS: A review of records of 39 T1D cases admitted over the past five years 
in two hospitals was done.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis among males (n=21) was 19.9±10.3 years and 
among females (n=18) was 12.3±7.5 years (t=2.614, p=0.013). Mean age at 
diagnosis of patients who were underweight (n=7) was 9.9±4.4 years, compared to 
17.8±10.1 years among patients (n=32) with normal or overweight status (t=2.028, 
p=0.05). The family history of T1D was present among 7(18.0%) cases. The most 
common symptoms among the cases were fatigue 22(56.4%), polyuria 19(48.7%) and 
polydipsia 18(46.1%). The most common sign was weight loss 27(69.2%). The most 
common complications were diabetic nephropathy and skin infections seen each 
among 10(25.6%) cases. Mean duration of T1D was significantly more among 
patients with diabetic nephropathy (p<0.001), compared to those without. Mean 
HbA1c value among patients was 12.9±2.7. It was significantly more among 
patients with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) (p=0.012). A short-acting insulin was 
used in the management of T1D among 59.5% cases. The outcome of the management 
showed a loss of one patient who developed DKA.
CONCLUSION: Routine growth monitoring and blood glucose analysis is required 
among T1D cases. The present study provides a database of risk factors, clinical 
features, and management practices among patients with T1D in this region and 
addresses several issues important to both patients and their care providers.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate all-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients 
with newly diagnosed granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) between 2 calendar 
time periods, 1997-2004 and 2005-2012.
METHODS: Using an administrative health database, we compared all patients with 
incident GPA with non-GPA controls matched for sex, age, and time of entry into 
the study. The study cohorts were divided into 2 subgroups based on the year of 
diagnosis ("early cohort [1997-2004] and "late cohort" [2005-2012]). The outcome 
was death (all-cause, cardiovascular disease [CVD]-related cancer-related, renal 
disease-related, and infection-related) during the follow-up period. Hazard 
ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, first adjusted 
for age, sex, and time of entry and then adjusted for selected covariates based 
on a purposeful selection algorithm.
RESULTS: Three hundred seventy patients with GPA and 3,700 non-GPA controls were 
included in this study, contributing 1,624.8 and 1,8671.3 person-years of 
follow-up, respectively. Sixty-eight deaths occurred in the GPA cohort, and 310 
deaths occurred in the non-GPA cohort. Overall, the age-, sex-, and entry 
time-adjusted all-cause mortality HR in the GPA cohort was 3.12 (95% confidence 
interval CI 2.35-4.14). There was excess mortality due to CVD-related causes, 
but not cancer, in the GPA cohort. Reports of death due to infection or renal 
disease was not permitted, because the numbers of death were insufficient (<6 
deaths for each outcome). All-cause mortality significantly improved between the 
early cohort and late cohort time periods (HR 5.61 and 2.33, respectively; P for 
interaction = 0.017).
CONCLUSION: This population-based study showed increased all-cause and 
CVD-related mortality risks in patients with GPA. There was significant 
improvement in the all-cause mortality risk over time, but the risk remained 
increased compared with that in the general population.

OBJECTIVE: The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) 3×3 method analyzes 
the occurrence of benefit and harm simultaneously at the individual patient 
level. We applied this method to 2 recent rheumatoid arthritis (RA) trial data 
sets.
METHODS: The Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) and the 
Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies (RACAT) randomized trial 
outcomes for safety were defined according to OMERACT as having no adverse 
events (AEs), non-serious AEs, and serious AEs. Treatment efficacy was defined 
as good, moderate, or no response. A good treatment response without any AEs was 
labeled an unqualified success, and no treatment response but at least 1 AE was 
considered an unmitigated failure. The association between benefit and harm was 
assessed by chi-square or exact tests, as appropriate.
RESULTS: In TEAR, 612 of 755 patients had response data at 48 weeks: 14% of 
patients experienced unqualified success and 9% had unmitigated failure, with no 
difference between the treatment arms. Treatment response and AE rates were not 
correlated. In RACAT, 309 of 353 patients had response data at 48 weeks: 6% of 
patients experienced unqualified success and 11% had unmitigated failure, with 
no differences between the treatment arms. Response and AE rates were negatively 
correlated. The frequency of AEs and serious AEs increased as response decreased 
(P = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: We found some evidence that clinical response may be reduced by the 
co-occurrence of AEs.

BACKGROUND: Disabilities in daily living and quality of life are key endpoints 
for evaluating the treatment outcome for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Factors 
possibly contributing to good outcome are adherence and health literacy.
METHODS: The survey included a representative nationwide sample of German 
rheumatologists and their patients with RA. The physician questionnaire included 
the disease activity score (DAS28) and medical prescriptions. The patient 
questionnaire included fatigue (EORTC QLQ-FA13), health assessment questionnaire 
(HAQ), quality of life (SF-12), health literacy (HELP), and patients' listings 
of their medications. Adherence was operationalized as follows: patient-reported 
(CQR5), behavioral (concordance between physicians' and patients' listings of 
medications), physician-assessed, and a combined measure of physician rating 
(1 = very adherent, 0 = less adherent) and the match between physicians' 
prescriptions and patients' accounts of their medications (1 = perfect match, 
0 = no perfect match) that yielded three categories of adherence: high, medium, 
and low. Simple and multiple linear regressions (controlling for age, sex, 
smoking, drinking alcohol, and sport) were calculated using adherence and health 
literacy as predictor variables, and disease activity and patient-reported 
outcomes as dependent variables.
RESULTS: 708 pairs of patient and physician questionnaires were analyzed. The 
mean patient age (73% women) was 60 years (SD = 12). Multiple regression 
analyses showed that high adherence was significantly associated with 5/7 
outcome variables and health literacy with 7/7 outcome variables.
CONCLUSION: Adherence and health literacy had weak but consistent effects on 
most outcomes. Thus, enhancing adherence and understanding of medical 
information could improve outcome, which should be investigated in future 
interventional studies.

Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase 1 inhibitor under development for the treatment 
of several inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Upadacitinib was administered in the phase 2 RA trials primarily as twice-daily 
regimens of an immediate-release (IR) formulation. The upadacitinib 
extended-release (ER) formulation was developed to enable once-daily dosing. In 
the present study, upadacitinib pharmacokinetics were characterized after the 
administration of single and multiple once-daily doses of the ER formulation in 
healthy subjects relative to single and multiple twice-daily doses of the IR 
formulation. Increase in upadacitinib exposure was dose-proportional over the 
evaluated 15- to 30-mg ER dose range. Single 15- and 30-mg ER doses provided 
equivalent AUC0-inf compared with single 12- and 24-mg IR doses, respectively. A 
high-fat breakfast increased upadacitinib ER Cmax and AUC0-inf by only 20% and 
17%, respectively, relative to fasting conditions. The median time to peak 
plasma concentrations was 2 to 4 hours for the ER formulation, and steady state 
was achieved by day 4 of once-daily dosing. Doses of 15 and 30 mg once daily 
using the ER formulation provided equivalent AUC0-24 , comparable Cmax and Cmin 
, and a fluctuation index over a 24-hour period at steady state similar to 6 and 
12 mg twice daily, respectively, using the IR formulation. These results 
supported the use of upadacitinib 15- and 30-mg doses of the ER formulation in 
the phase 3 trials in RA.

Exosomes have emerged as novel nanovesicles that facilitate intracellular 
communication. The molecular content of exosomes is specific to their cell type 
of origin and reflective of the cells physiological status. Combined with their 
stability and accessibility in a variety of biofluids, exosomes may be used as 
biomarkers in a variety of diseases. Recent evidence suggests that exosomes have 
immunomodulatory functions that play a role in the severity and development of 
autoimmune disorders and cancers. This article focuses on the biomarker and 
therapeutic potential of exosomes for oral manifestation of autoimmune diseases 
and head and neck cancers.

BACKGROUND: Facial pain response (PR) to various surgical interventions in 
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is much 
less optimal. No large patient series regarding stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) 
has been published.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of MS-related TN treated with SRS.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. A total of 263 patients 
contributed by 9 member tertiary referral Gamma Knife centers (2 in Canada and 7 
in USA) of the International Gamma Knife Research Consortium (IGKRF) constituted 
this study.
RESULTS: The median latency period of PR after SRS was 1 mo. Reasonable pain 
control (Barrow Neurological Institute [BNI] Pain Scores I-IIIb) was achieved in 
232 patients (88.2%). The median maintenance period from SRS was 14.1 months 
(range, 10 days to 10 years). The actuarial reasonable pain control maintenance 
rates at 1 yr, 2 yr, and 4 yr were 54%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. There was a 
correlation between the status of achieving BNI-I and the maintenance of facial 
pain recurrence-free rate. The median recurrence-free rate was 36 mo and 12.2 mo 
in patients achieving BNI-I and BNI > I, respectively (P = .046). Among 210 
patients with known status of post-SRS complications, the new-onset of facial 
numbness (BNI-I or II) after SRS occurred in 21 patients (10%).
CONCLUSION: In this largest series SRS offers a reasonable benefit to risk 
profile for patients who have exhausted medical management. More favorable 
initial response to SRS may predict a long-lasting pain control.

Statistically significant improvement in fatigue impact (P<.0001) measured with 
FIS; in general, perception of heath outcome in urinary quality of life scale 
KHQ (P=.033), and in subscales 2, 3 and 4 of MSQOL-54 (P=.011). Control group 
showed no improvement in any scale.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces current literature that supports hippotherapy 
as an adequate intervention for MS patients. Further studies with more 
participants, control groups and blinded research would be logical steps for 
future research in this field.

The classification of the systemic vasculitides has been controversial for 
several decades. The Chapel Hill consensus Conference definitions originally 
developed in 1994, but revised and extended in 2012 are now widely accepted. The 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were first published in 1990, 
are now generally accepted to be out of date and new criteria are needed. More 
recently the classical division of the ANCA vasculitides using clinical 
phenotype has come under scrutiny with evidence from epidemiological, genetic 
and outcome studies that perhaps these conditions should be classified on the 
basis of ANCA specificity into PR3-ANCA positive and MPO-ANCA positive groups. 
The traditional distinction between giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis 
has been questioned and some recent studies of GCA have included patients with 
only extra-cranial disease. The Diagnostic and Classification Criteria of 
Vasculitis study (DCVAS) will provide new validated classification criteria for 
the systemic vasculitides.

OBJECTIVE: Although systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common 
autoimmune disease associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), limited 
data exist regarding the impact of SLE on the clinical phenotype of aPL-positive 
patients. The primary objective of this study was to compare the clinical, 
laboratory, and treatment characteristics of aPL-positive patients with SLE with 
those of aPL-positive patients without SLE.
METHODS: A secure web-based data capture system was used to store patient 
demographic characteristics and aPL-related clinical and laboratory 
characteristics. Inclusion criteria included positive aPL according to the 
updated Sapporo classification criteria. Antiphospholipid antibody-positive 
patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the 
classification of SLE ("aPL with SLE") and those with no other autoimmune 
diseases ("aPL only") were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-two aPL-positive patients were recruited from 24 
international centers; 426 of these patients did not have other autoimmune 
disease, and 197 had SLE. The frequency of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, 
low complement levels, and IgA anti-β2 -glycoprotein I (anti-β2 GPI) antibodies 
was higher in the aPL-positive patients with SLE, whereas the frequency of 
cognitive dysfunction and IgG anti-β2 GPI antibodies was higher in the aPL-only 
group. The frequency of arterial and venous thromboses (including recurrent) as 
well as pregnancy morbidity was similar in the 2 groups. The prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease risk factors at the time of entry into the registry entry 
did not differ between the 2 groups, with the exception of current smoking, 
which was more frequent in aPL-positive patients with SLE.
CONCLUSION: Although the frequencies of thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity are 
similar in aPL-positive patients with and those without SLE, the diagnosis of 
SLE in patients with persistently positive aPL is associated with an increased 
frequency of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, low complement levels, and 
positive IgA anti-β2 GPI antibodies.

OBJECTIVE: Relative to studies of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 
epidemiologic studies of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE) are rare 
and are limited to populations with no racial diversity. We sought to provide 
minimum estimates of the incidence of primary CCLE (CCLE in the absence of SLE) 
in a population comprised predominantly of white individuals and black 
individuals in the southeastern region of the US.
METHODS: The Georgia Lupus Registry allowed for the use of multiple sources for 
case-finding, including dermatology and rheumatology practices, multispecialty 
health care facilities, and dermatopathology reports. Cases with a clinical or 
clinical/histologic diagnosis of CCLE were classified as definite. Cases 
ascertained exclusively from dermatopathology reports were categorized as 
probable. Age-standardized incidence rates stratified by sex and race were 
calculated for discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) in particular and for CCLE in 
general.
RESULTS: The overall age-adjusted estimates for combined (definite and probable) 
CCLE were 3.9 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 
3.4-4.5). The overall age-adjusted incidences of definite and combined DLE were 
2.9 (95% CI 2.4-3.4) and 3.7 (95% CI 3.2-4.3) per 100,000 person-years, 
respectively. When capture-recapture methods were used, the age-adjusted 
incidence of definite DLE increased to 4.0 (95% CI 3.2-4.3). The black:white and 
female:male incidence ratios for definite DLE were 5.4 and 3.1, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the striking racial disparities in 
susceptibility to primary CCLE, with black individuals having a 3-fold to 5-fold 
increased incidence of CCLE in general, and DLE in particular, compared with 
white individuals. The observed sex differences were consistent with those 
reported previously, with a 3 times higher risk of DLE in women compared with 
men.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the perspectives of patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) on electronic recording of between-visit disease activity and other 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and on sharing this information with health 
care providers or peers.
METHODS: Patients with RA were recruited to participate in focus groups from 
December 2014 to April 2015. The topic guide and analysis were based on the 
Andersen-Newman framework. Sessions were audiorecorded, transcribed, 
independently coded, and analyzed for themes.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients participated in 7 focus groups. Their mean ± SD age 
was 51 ± 13.1 years, 94% were women, 52% were African American, 11% were 
Hispanic, and 37% were white. Three themes emerged: provider communication, 
information-seeking about RA, and social and peer support. Participants 
expressed a willingness to track disease activity data to share with health care 
providers electronically if providers would act on the information. Participants 
envisioned symptom tracking and information sharing as a mechanism to relay and 
obtain reliable information about RA. Participants were also interested in 
electronic communication between visits if it facilitated learning about symptom 
management and enhanced opportunities for social support among patients with RA.
CONCLUSION: Patients with RA may be amenable to electronic collection and 
sharing of PRO-type data between clinical encounters if it facilitates 
communication with health care providers and provides access to reliable 
information about RA. Providing patients with social support was important for 
enhancing PROs collection by helping them overcome barriers by using electronic 
devices and overcome reservations about the value of these data.

Giant cell arteritis is the commonest primary vasculitis of the elderly. 
However, the prevalence does vary widely between populations with highest 
incidence amongst Northern Europeans and lowest amongst East Asians. Preliminary 
studies suggest that clinical manifestations may differ between different 
populations. Newer diagnostic approaches including ultrasound, MR angiography 
and PET imaging are under review. While there have been recent advances in the 
diagnosis of GCA particularly with regard to imaging, there is an urgent need 
for improvements in methods of diagnosis, treatment and requirement for 
screening. Glucocorticoid treatment remain the backbone of therapy. However, 
glucocorticoid therapy is associated with significant adverse effects. 
Conventional and novel immunosuppressive agents have only demonstrated modest 
effects in a subgroup of steroid refractory GCA due to the different arms of the 
immune system at play. However, recently a study of IL-6 blockade demonstrated 
benefit in GCA. Newer approaches such as fast-track pathways can also result in 
improvements in consequences of GCA including blindness.

Inflammasome activation plays key roles in host defense, but also contributes to 
the pathogenesis of auto-inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. As 
autophagy is connected with both the innate and adaptive immune systems, 
autophagic dysfunction is also closely related to inflammation, infection, and 
neurodegeneration. Here we identify that lincRNA-Cox2, previously known as a 
mediator of both the activation and repression of immune genes expression in 
innate immune cells, could bind NF-κB p65 and promote its nuclear translocation 
and transcription, modulating the expression of inflammasome sensor NLRP3 and 
adaptor ASC. Knockdown of lincRNA-Cox2 inhibited the inflammasome activation and 
prevented the lincRNA-Cox2-triggered caspase-1 activation, leading to decreased 
IL-1β secretion and weakened TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β 
(TRIF) cleavage, thereby enhancing TRIF-mediated autophagy. Elucidation of the 
link between lincRNA-Cox2 and the inflammasome-autophagy crosstalk in macrophage 
and microglia reveals a role for lncRNAs in activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and 
autophagy, and provides new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in 
neuroinflammation-dependent diseases.

PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features, treatment and visual outcomes of 
Japanese patients with new-onset acute Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.
METHODS: Clinical records of 111 patients who presented between 1999 and 2015 to 
the Ocular Inflammation Service of the Kyorin Eye Center, Tokyo, were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 111 patients (68 women, 43 men), 16 had complete, 90 had 
incomplete and 5 had probable VKH disease. The median follow-up period was 36 
months (4-175 months). The mean age at presentation was 41 years (19-74 years). 
Serous retinal detachment (202 eyes) and optic disc hyperaemia (89 eyes) were 
observed at presentation. Of the patients tested, 45/48 (93.8%) were 
human leucocyte antigen-DR4 positive and 63/77 (81.8%) had cerebrospinal fluid 
pleocytosis. Initial corticosteroid treatment consisted of pulse intravenous 
therapy in all patients. Sunset glow fundus was observed in 49.5% of eyes, and 
anterior and/or posterior segment recurrence of inflammation was observed in 25 
patients (22.5%). Treatment was transitioned to cyclosporine in 17 patients 
(15.3%) for steroid sparing (6 patients) or recurrent inflammation (11 
patients), with good subsequent control. Ocular complications were observed in 
47 of 222 eyes (21.2%) (mostly cataract), and systemic complications were 
observed in 8.1% of patients (mostly hypertension and diabetes mellitus). 
Ninety-three percent of eyes (167 of 178 eyes) had a visual acuity of ≥1.0 at 
1 year after presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive corticosteroid treatment strategy in a large number 
of patients with new-onset acute VKH disease, with transitioning to cyclosporine 
in selected cases, resulted in excellent visual outcomes and low rates of 
recurrence.

AIM: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as an inflammatory autoimmune disease affects the 
synovial joints as well as other organs and tissues. Since aberrant expression 
of MIC molecules has been observed in RA patient, MIC genotypes might play 
certain roles in the development of RA.
METHOD: To explore the association of MICA and MICB polymorphisms with RA in a 
Han Chinese population in Hainan Island, samples from 172 RA and 137 healthy 
controls were genotyped for MICA and MICB.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that MICB*002 and MICB*014 were less frequent in 
RA patients than in controls (P = 0.000, 0.005) while there were higher 
percentages of RA patients carrying MICA*009 and MICA*A6 (P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Different MIC variants might modulate the autoimmune reaction 
differently in RA disease and therefore serve as protective or risk factors.

OBJECTIVES: EULAR recently proposed to screen multimorbidities in chronic 
inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The aims of the study were to define the most 
common multimorbidities in chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, compare the 
screening approach performed in the clinic with the recent EULAR 
recommendations, validate the points to consider for the systematic standardized 
multimorbidity screening proposed by EULAR and assess feasibility of such a 
screening in a daily clinic.
METHODS: Data were collected prospectively during a 1-day multimorbidity clinic. 
Diabetes, hypertension, CVD damage, chronic respiratory diseases, osteoporosis 
and preventive measures were assessed. The comparison with EULAR points to 
consider was performed retrospectively.
RESULTS: We included 200 consecutive patients (157 with rheumatoid arthritis, 37 
spondyloarthritis, and 6 connective tissue diseases or vasculitis). The most 
common multimorbidities already diagnosed in our patients were hypertension 
(26%) and diabetes (7.5%). Screening showed that 61.5% (CI95%: 54.6%-67.9%) 
patients presented at least one undiagnosed or uncontrolled diseases: diabetes 
(6%), hypertension (20.6%), dyslipidemia (16.1%) valvulopathies (16.8%), 
peripheral artery disease (4.5%); carotid stenosis (6.5%) and aortic aneurysm 
(5.5%). Overall, 39.9% patients had incomplete cancer screening and 52.8% 
incomplete vaccine schedule. Undiagnosed pulmonary obstruction and risk of sleep 
apnea were suspected in 15.5% and 40.1% patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study underlines the relevance of a systematic screening of 
multimorbidities in chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases and its feasibility 
in a 1-day clinic. Spirometry and sleep apnea screening should be added to EULAR 
points to consider. The long-term impact of such screening needs to be 
evaluated.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread pain 
and associated with unspecific symptoms. So far, no laboratory tests have been 
validated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence in 
saliva of potential diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers which could be 
useful for the management of FM patients. Specifically, the salivary profile of 
FM patients was compared with those of healthy subjects, subjects suffering 
migraine (model of non-inflammatory chronic pain), and patients affected by 
rheumatoid arthritis (model of inflammatory chronic pain). For proteomics 
analysis 2-DE and SELDI-TOF-MS were applied. From 2-DE serotransferrin and 
alpha-enolase were found differentially expressed in FM. Hence, their expression 
was validated by ELISA together with phosphoglycerate-mutase-I and 
transaldolase, which were found in a previous work. Moreover, ROC curve was 
calculated by comparing FM patients versus control subjects (healthy plus 
migraine) to investigate the discriminative power of biomarkers. The best 
performance was obtained by combining alpha-enolase, phosphoglycerate-mutase-I 
and serotransferrin. On the other hand, none of the candidate proteins showed a 
statistical correlation with clinical features. Finally, preliminary SELDI 
analysis highlighted two peaks whose identification need to be validated. 
Overall, these results could be useful in supporting the clinical diagnosis of 
FM. SIGNIFICANCE: FM is one of the most common chronic pain condition which is 
associated with significant disability. The fibromyalgic pain is a peculiar 
characteristic of this disease and FM patients suffer from reduced quality of 
life, daily functioning and productivity. Considering the deep complexity of FM, 
the discovery of more objective markers is crucial for supporting clinical 
diagnosis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the selection of 
biomarkers effectively associated with fibromyalgic pain which will enable 
clinicians to achieve an unambiguous diagnosis, and to improve approaches to 
patients' management. We defined a panel of 3 salivary proteins which could be 
one of the criteria to be taken into account. Consequently, the identification 
of disease salivary biomarkers could be helpful in detecting FM clusters and 
targeted treatment. Actually, our future perspective foresees to develop a 
simple, rapid and not invasive point-of-care testing which will be of use during 
the diagnostic process. In addition, the present results can offer a clue for 
shedding light upon the complex entity of such a disease like FM.

Purpose: To report low-dose rituximab effect in Graves' orbitopathy (GO) 
resistant to conventional treatment. Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical 
records, filled in according to the European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy 
(EUGOGO) standards, of patients with active moderate-to-severe GO who received 
low-dose rituximab after failure of conventional treatment. Efficacy was defined 
by a decrease of the clinical activity score of 2 points or <4/10. Results: 
Among 219 patients treated between 2012 and 2016 by pulse methylprednisolone, 
possibly followed by oral steroids and/or orbital radiotherapy, 15 (6.8%) 
finally received 100 mg rituximab doses (cumulative dose, 100-400 mg) owing to 
persistent active disease. Rituximab showed efficacy within 2 months in 13 of 15 
(87%), stable at 1 year. No significant effect was observed on proptosis, lid 
fissure width, and eye motility. Conclusion: Low-dose rituximab showed sustained 
anti-inflammatory effect in most patients with active GO resistant to 
conventional treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between myasthenia gravis (MG) and 
human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection in the thymus.
METHODS: The presence of human B19V DNA and protein was assessed in 138 
samples-including 68 thymic hyperplasias (39 with MG), 58 thymomas (23 with MG), 
and 12 normal thymus tissues-using a nested polymerase chain reaction, 
immunohistochemistry, laser capture microdissection, and sequencing in a 
double-blinded manner.
RESULTS: B19V DNA was detected mainly in thymic hyperplasia, and the positivity 
rate (41.18%, 28/68) was significantly higher than that in thymoma (3.45%, 2/58) 
(p <0.001) but not that in normal thymic tissues. Correspondingly, the 
positivity rate in thymic hyperplasia with MG (30.77%, 12/39) was significantly 
higher than that in thymoma with MG (4.35%, 1/23) (p=0.021). However, it was 
higher in thymic hyperplasia without MG (55.17%, 16/29) than in thymic 
hyperplasia with MG (30.77%, 12/39) (p=0.043). Cells in thymic hyperplasia 
positive for B19V VP1/VP2 protein (63.24%, 43/68) were identified mainly in 
ectopic germinal centres and thymic corpuscle epithelial cells, but were rare in 
thymomas (1.72%, 1/58) (p <0.001). Moreover, the positivity rate was 
significantly higher in thymic hyperplasia with MG (74.36%, 29/39) than in 
thymic hyperplasia without MG (48.28%, 14/29) (p=0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the present study is the first to show that human 
B19V infection is closely associated with thymic hyperplasia and 
thymic-hyperplasia-associated MG, but is not related to thymoma or 
thymoma-associated MG. The findings reveal a previously unrecognized 
aetiopathogenic mechanism of thymic-hyperplasia-associated MG, evoking numerous 
questions that require further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks in systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) are similar to those in diabetes mellitus (DM). We investigated whether 
the numbers of lipid tests and statin prescriptions in patients with SLE are 
comparable with those in patients with DM and those in individuals without 
either disease.
METHODS: Using Analytic eXtract files from 29 states for 2007-2010, we 
identified a cohort of US Medicaid beneficiaries, ages 18-65 years, with 
prevalent SLE. Each SLE patient was matched for age and sex with 2 patients with 
DM and 4 individuals in the general Medicaid population who did not have either 
SLE or DM. We compared the proportions of patients in each cohort who received 
≥1 lipid test and ≥1 statin prescription during 1-year follow-up. We used 
multivariable logistic regression to calculate the odds of lipid testing and 
receiving prescriptions for statins and conditional logistic regression to 
compare the matched cohorts.
RESULTS: We identified 3 Medicaid cohorts: 25,950 patients with SLE, 51,900 
patients with DM, and 103,800 Medicaid recipients without either condition. In 
these cohorts, lipid testing was performed in 24% of patients in the SLE group, 
43% of patients in the DM group, and 16% of individuals in the group with 
neither condition, and statin prescriptions were dispensed in 11%, 33%, and 7% 
of these groups, respectively. SLE patients were 66% less likely (odds ratio 
[OR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.34-0.35) to have lipid tests and 
82% less likely (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.18-0.18) to fill a statin prescription 
compared with DM patients. SLE patients were also less likely (OR 0.89, 95% CI 
0.84-0.94) to fill a statin prescription compared with individuals in the 
general Medicaid population.
CONCLUSION: Despite having an elevated risk of CVD, SLE patients received less 
lipid testing and received fewer statin prescriptions compared with age- and 
sex-matched DM patients and individuals in the general Medicaid population; this 
gap should be a target for improvement.

OBJECTIVE: To determine excess productivity losses and costs of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and Sjögren's syndrome (SS) at 
the population level.
METHODS: Administrative databases from the province of British Columbia, Canada, 
were used to establish population-based cohorts of SLE, SSc, and SS, and matched 
comparison cohorts were selected from the general population. Random samples 
from these cohorts were surveyed about time absent from paid and unpaid work and 
working at reduced levels/efficiency (presenteeism), using validated labor 
questionnaires. We estimated excess productivity losses and costs of each 
diagnosis (over and above nonsystemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases 
[non-SARDs]), using 2-part models and work disability rates (not employed due to 
health).
RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 167 SLE, 42 SSc, and 90 SS patients, and by 
375 non-SARDs (comparison group) participants. Altogether, predicted excess 
hours of paid and unpaid work loss were 3.5, 3.2, and 3.4 hours per week for 
SLE, SSc, and SS patients, respectively. Excess costs were $86, $69, and $84 
(calculated as 2015 Canadian dollars) per week, or $4,494, $3,582, and $4,357 
per person annually, respectively. Costs for productivity losses from paid work 
stemmed mainly from presenteeism (SLE = 69% of costs, SSc = 67%, SS = 64%, and 
non-SARDs = 53%), not from absenteeism. However, many working-age patients were 
not employed at all, due to health (SLE = 36%, SSc = 32%, SS = 30%, and 
non-SARDs = 18%), and the majority of total productivity costs were from unpaid 
work loss (SLE = 73% of costs, SSc = 74%, SS = 60%, and non-SARDs = 47%). 
Adjusted excess costs from these unpaid production losses were $127, $100, and 
$82 per week, respectively, among SLE, SSc, and SS patients.
CONCLUSION: In this population-based sample of prevalent SLE, SSc, and SS, lost 
productivity costs were substantial, mainly from presenteeism and unpaid work 
impairments.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism and clinical significance of 
depression-related differences in performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities 
Test (SDMT).
METHODS: The influence of depression on two versions of a computerized SDMT 
(i.e. fixed versus variable code) was assessed. Both versions involve processing 
speed, but the fixed c-SDMT also encompasses incidental visual memory.
RESULTS: Depression was associated with a 19.06% slowing on the variable ( 
p = 0.002) and an 8.10% slowing on the fixed ( p = 0.219) c-SDMT.
CONCLUSION: Depression-associated differences in performance on the SDMT appear 
linked more to a reduction in processing speed than a decline in incidental 
visual memory and exceed the 10% threshold considered clinically significant.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the scientific evidence of 
dietary intervention, either through diet or supplementation, and its effects on 
the health of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Methods: Literature 
searches were conducted using Scopus, PubMed, BioMed Central and Science Direct 
databases. The terms used for the search were diet, nutritional support, 
nutrition therapy and systemic lupus erythematosus. Results: Eleven studies with 
interventions related to supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D and 
turmeric, as well as changes in diet composition, such as low glycaemic index 
diet were identified. Conclusions: The studies evidenced that omega-3 
supplementation reduced inflammation, disease activity, endothelial dysfunction 
and oxidative stress; vitamin D supplementation increased serum levels, reduced 
inflammatory and hemostatic markers; turmeric supplementation reduced 
proteinuria, hematuria and systolic blood pressure; and low glycaemic index diet 
caused weight loss and reduced fatigue.

PURPOSE: Vision-threatening ocular inflammation can be a devastating 
complication of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Here we performed a 
retrospective observational study to describe the safety and efficacy of 
treating scleritis and uveitis with either cyclophosphamide or rituximab in GPA.
METHODS: A chart review of patients diagnosed with GPA-associated scleritis or 
uveitis, treated with either cyclophosphamide or rituximab as the final therapy 
at our clinic, was conducted. A total of 1 year of follow-up visits was required 
for inclusion in the study.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients (19 eyes) suffering from GPA-associated scleritis 
and/or uveitis were identified. As the final therapy, rituximab was administered 
to 9 patients and cyclophosphamide to 4. Mean duration of follow-up was 55 
months (range 16-23 months). Remission was observed in all patients. Three 
patients had a flare of scleritis after the completion of therapy, and they were 
restarted on their respective agents. One patient had a flare of retinal 
vasculitis during rituximab therapy. One patient on cyclophosphamide experienced 
transient leukopenia. No adverse side effects of rituximab were noted throughout 
the course of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide and rituximab are safe and effective agents for 
controlling scleritis and uveitis associated with GPA, with eventual progression 
towards steroid-sparing remission.

Occipital neuralgia associates with high cervical spinal cord lesions in 
idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disease.

Kissoon NR(1), Watson JC(1), Boes CJ(1), Kantarci OH(1).

(1)Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic. Rochester, MN, USA.

BACKGROUND: The association of trigeminal neuralgia with pontine lesions has 
been well documented in multiple sclerosis, and we tested the hypothesis that 
occipital neuralgia in multiple sclerosis is associated with high cervical 
spinal cord lesions.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 29 patients diagnosed with 
both occipital neuralgia and demyelinating disease by a neurologist from January 
2001 to December 2014. We collected data on demographics, clinical findings, 
presence of C2-3 demyelinating lesions, and treatment responses.
RESULTS: The patients with both occipital neuralgia and multiple sclerosis were 
typically female (76%) and had a later onset (age > 40) of occipital neuralgia 
(72%). Eighteen patients (64%) had the presence of C2-3 lesions and the majority 
had unilateral symptoms (83%) or episodic pain (78%). All patients with 
documented sensory loss (3/3) had C2-3 lesions. Most patients with progressive 
multiple sclerosis (6/8) had C2-3 lesions. Of the eight patients with C2-3 
lesions and imaging at onset of occipital neuralgia, five (62.5%) had evidence 
of active demyelination. None of the patients with progressive multiple 
sclerosis (3/3) responded to occipital nerve blocks or high dose intravenous 
steroids, whereas all of the other phenotypes with long term follow-up (eight 
patients) had good responses.
CONCLUSIONS: A cervical spine MRI should be considered in all patients 
presenting with occipital neuralgia. In patients with multiple sclerosis, 
clinical features in occipital neuralgia that were predictive of the presence of 
a C2-3 lesion were unilateral episodic symptoms, sensory loss, later onset of 
occipital neuralgia, and progressive multiple sclerosis phenotype. Clinical 
phenotype predicted response to treatment.

Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis: are they a spectrum of the same 
disease?

Kermani TA(1).

(1)Division of Rheumatology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of 
California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK) are forms of 
large-vessel vasculitides that affect the aorta and its branches. There is 
ongoing debate about whether they are within a spectrum of the same disease or 
different diseases. Shared commonalities include clinical features, evidence of 
systemic inflammation, granulomatous inflammation on biopsy, role of T-helper 
(Th)-1 and Th17 in the pathogenesis, and, abnormalities of the aorta and its 
branches on imaging. However, there are also several differences in the 
geographic distribution, genetics, inflammatory cells and responses to 
treatment. This review highlights the similarities and differences in the 
epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, imaging findings and 
treatment responses in these conditions. Current data supports that they are two 
distinct conditions despite the numerous similarities.

Iran.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic multi systemic disorder with 
the unclarified ethiopathology. Although several markers have been presented for 
recognition of RA, but none of them has been specific. New markers such as HLA 
typing and activity of Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) isoenzymes could be useful and 
specific.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the pattern of ADA isoenzymes 
activity and HLA typing in both RA patients and healthy cases.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 55 RA patients and 60 healthy 
subjects, over a period of 6 months. Levels of C-reactive Protein (CRP), 
Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and ADA (ADA1, ADA2, total ADA) were measured using 
AVITEX kit and HITACHI Auto Analyzer. In addition, HLA-DRB1*01,*04 and *10 was 
detected using PCR-SSP.
RESULTS: ADA activity, particularly ADA2 level, was significantly higher among 
RA group (Pv <0.05). The concentrations of tADA in patients with RF and CRP 
positive were significantly higher (Pv <0.05). The allele prevalence of DRB1*01 
was significantly higher in RA patients (13.1%) compared with control group 
(5.5%, respectively) (P <0.05, Bonferroni adjustment P<0.003). Calculated 
sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic tests in this study are listed as: 
CRP (75%), RF (80%), ADA (84%) and RF (90%), ADA (83%), CRP (72%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Increased tADA level and the frequency of DRB1*10 and *01 caused 
susceptibility to RA.

Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies (IMNMs) are a group of acquired 
autoimmune muscle disorders which are characterized by proximal muscle weakness, 
high levels of creatinine kinase, and myopathic findings on electromyogram 
(EMG). Muscle biopsy in IMNM differentiates it from the other subgroups of 
Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis (IIM) by the presence of myofibre necrosis and 
prominent regeneration without substantial lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates. 
Anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) and anti-3hydroxy-3 
methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) autoantibodies were found in 
two-thirds of IMNM patients. In terms of treatment, IMNM is more resistant to 
conventional immunosuppressive treatment, therefore, other modalities of 
treatment such as Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rituximab are often 
required.

Is Treat-to-target in Lupus Nephritis Realistic in Clinical Practice?

Mok CC(1).

The Treat-to-Target (T2T) principle has been advocated in a number of 
inflammatory and non-inflammatory medical illnesses. Tight control of disease 
activity has been shown to improve the outcome of rheumatoid arthritis and 
psoriatic arthritis as compared to the conventional approach. However, whether 
T2T can be applied to patients with lupus nephritis is still under emerging 
discussion. Treatment of lupus nephritis should target at inducing and 
maintaining remission of the kidney inflammation so as to preserve renal 
function and improve survival in the longterm. However, there is no universal 
agreement on the definition of remission or low disease activity state of 
nephritis, as well as the time points for switching of therapies. Moreover, 
despite the availability of objective parameters for monitoring such as 
proteinuria and urinary sediments, differentiation between ongoing activity and 
damage in some patients with persistent urinary abnormalities remains difficult 
without a renal biopsy. A large number of serum and urinary biomarkers have been 
tested in lupus nephritis but none of them have been validated for routine 
clinical use. In real life practice, therapeutic options for lupus nephritis are 
limited. As patients with lupus nephritis are more prone to infective 
complications, tight disease control with aggressive immunosuppressive therapies 
may have safety concern. Not until the feasibility, efficacy, safety and 
cost-effectiveness of T2T in lupus nephritis is confirmed by comparative trials, 
this approach should not be routinely recommended with the current treatment 
armamentarium and monitoring regimes.

PURPOSE: The biological association between chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis 
(CLT) and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has not been elucidated yet. The 
aim of the study was to assess whether the presence of CLT exerts any influence 
on clinical or histological presentation of DTC.
METHODS: Nine hundred and seven consecutive patients with DTC treated in the 
years 1998-2016 were divided into two groups according to the presence or 
absence of concomitant CLT. The statistical differences were analysed.
RESULTS: Out of 907 patients included in the study, 331 were diagnosed with DTC 
and CLT (studied group), while 576 patients with DTC but without CLT constituted 
a control group. The distribution of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer did 
not differ. In CLT group, the prevalence of pT1 was greater than for pT2-pT4 DTC 
(P = 0.0003; OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.27-2.24) compared to controls (68.3 vs. 56.1%, 
respectively). The presence of multifocal lesions was similar. The thyroid 
capsule infiltration without extrathyroidal invasion (P < 0.0001; OR = 0.21, 95% 
CI 0.14-0.31) was more frequent in the studied group, unlike extracapsular 
invasion, which was significantly more often present in patients with DTC but 
without CLT (P = 0.004; OR = 1.66; 95% CI 1.17-2.34) as well as nodal 
involvement (P = 0.048; OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.42-0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: The collected data indicate a protective role of CLT in preventing 
the spread of the DTC. The presence of CLT might limit tumour growth to the 
primary site.

Are PR3 positive and MPO positive GPA the same disease?

Foundation Trust, Norwich, UK.

Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis is a necrotising systemic vasculitis 
predominantly affecting small and medium sized vessels. It is predominantly 
associated with antibodies directed against proteinase 3, but a small number of 
individuals with this disease have antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase. 
The premise of this paper is to explore the possibility that these two serotypes 
maybe two separate diseases. There is evidence that the same single nucleotide 
polymorphisms in the TLR 9 gene is associated with increased risk for PR3 ANCA 
positivity but protects against MPO ANCA positivity. There is some evidence that 
MPO ANCA positive GPA disease may be 'limited' in its expression and be 
associated with the more indolent phenotype. The genotype may affect the 
serotype, and the serotype might affect the phenotype. There has been limited 
success in identifying how the difference in phenotype might affect outcomes. We 
are at a very early stage in our understanding of how these serotypes might be 
treated differently. This paper attempts to critically appraise the evidence 
available so far.

Bone is a crucial element of the skeletal-locomotor system, but also functions 
as an immunological organ that harbors hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and 
immune progenitor cells. Additionally, the skeletal and immune systems share a 
number of regulatory molecules, including cytokines and signaling molecules. 
Osteoimmunology was created as an interdisciplinary field to explore the shared 
molecules and interactions between the skeletal and immune systems. In 
particular, the importance of an inseparable link between the two systems has 
been highlighted by studies on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in 
which pathogenic helper T cells induce the progressive destruction of multiple 
joints through aberrant expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor 
(NF)-κB ligand (RANKL). The conceptual bridge of osteoimmunology provides not 
only a novel framework for understanding these biological systems but also a 
molecular basis for the development of therapeutic approaches for diseases of 
bone and/or the immune system.

OBJECTIVES: Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) mediate 
negative signal in autoimmune diseases. While little is known about its role in 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The study aimed to reveal the circulating 
cell profile and the relative PD-1/PD-L1 expression of JIA subsets, elucidating 
their underlying immunomodulatory mechanisms.
METHODS: We detected the circulating cells and the relative PD-1/PD-L1 signaling 
in 101 JIA patients and 50 controls by flow cytometry and analyzed their 
association with disease activity and clinical manifestations.
RESULTS: Different from other JIA types, active systemic JIA (sJIA) patients had 
lower percentage and count of CD4+T cells and lower PD-1 expression on them 
compared with healthy controls (P<0.05), active polyarthritis (P<0.05) and 
enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) patients (P<0.05). Also, they had higher 
percentage and count of myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) and lower PD-L1 expression 
on mDC compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). Both PD-1 on CD4+T cell and 
PD-L1 on mDC were negatively correlated with JADAS-27 in sJIA patients (P<0.05). 
In addition, PD-1 expression on CD4+T cell was negatively associated with the 
number of involved joints (P<0.05) and PD-L1 on mDC was lower in patients with 
fever (P<0.01), which could further divide patients into two groups of different 
manifestations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding displayed decreased CD4+T cell, increased mDC and 
reduced PD-1/PD-L1 signal in sJIA PBMC comparing with other JIA subsets, which 
might be helpful in JIA differential diagnosis and responsible for distinct 
clinical manifestations via different mechanisms.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) has an important role in the body composition 
of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), and 
spondyloarthritis (SpA). We aimed to assess the nutritional profile of patients 
with RA, CD, and SpA undergoing remission with multiple therapies comparing to 
controls and to analyze the effect of anti-TNFα medications in the nutritional 
parameters of these patients. One hundred thirty-one patients were included: 44 
with RA, 43 with CD, and 44 with SpA. Patients receiving anti-TNFα were compared 
with those receiving non-biological treatment as well as to controls. 
Nutritional profile included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), 
mid-upper arm circumference, and triceps skinfold measurement. Overweight and 
obesity were highly prevalent on three assessed groups. In patients with RA, BMI 
was > 25 kg/m2 in 74.9% patients and 49.2% controls (p < 0.0005); in CD, in 
55.7% patients and 41.2% controls (p < 0.0001); and in SpA, in 68.1% patients 
and 43.5% controls (p < 0.0001). Central obesity was higher in all three disease 
groups when compared to healthy controls. There was no significant difference on 
nutritional parameters in patients using or not using anti-TNFα medications, 
except in patients with SpA, in which biologic therapy was significantly 
associated with lower BMI and WC, when compared to other therapies. Overweight, 
obesity, and elevated WC were more prevalent in patients with RA, CD, and SpA 
undergoing remission when compared to controls despite of used therapy. The use 
of biologic drugs in patients with SpA was associated with a lower BMI and lower 
WC.

Increasing physical activity (PA) through exercise is associated with 
improvements in many of the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) 
such as fatigue, strength, balance, and mobility. Despite this, people with MS 
remain largely inactive. Interventions that are grounded in theory and that aim 
to change PA behavior need to be developed. The purpose of this study was to 
describe the development process of a web-based resource, namely, "Activity 
Matters," to enable people with MS to become more active. Development of the 
"Activity Matters" online intervention was guided by the UK's Medical Research 
Council (MRC) framework for the development and evaluation of complex 
interventions and the behavior change wheel (BCW). Seven sources of data were 
used to inform the process and were mapped on to both the MRC and BCW 
frameworks. The intervention is theoretically based, and constructs including 
knowledge, memory, attention and decision processes, skills, social influences, 
environmental context and resources, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about 
consequences, goals, and emotions were recognized as important. "Activity 
Matters" is the first MS PA intervention to be developed using the theoretical 
approach outlined by the BCW and MRC complex interventions frameworks. The next 
phase of this work is to test the usability, acceptability, and preliminary 
effectiveness of "Activity Matters" among people with MS.

BACKGROUND: By 2015, the World Health Organization reported that 1% of the world 
population suffered from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in Latin America (LA) 
between 0.5% and 1%. Previously, in May 2014, a consensus meeting was held in 
Barranquilla, Colombia, where the Project for Implementation and Accreditation 
of Centers of Excellence (CoE) in RA in LA was established, which then became an 
official special group of the Pan American League of Associations for 
Rheumatology (PANLAR).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to define the methodological approach for 
the accreditation process of CoE in RA in LA.
METHODS: A meeting was held in April 2015 with participation of the members of 
the REAL-PANLAR Steering Committee, and representatives of several LA countries, 
with the support of 2 experts in accreditation processes and models in Colombia. 
Then, in November 2015 in San Francisco and in November 2016 in Washington, the 
REAL-PANLAR Steering Committee met to discuss some final aspects of the project.
RESULTS: The following steps for accreditation were defined: application for 
accreditation, issuance of the concept of assessment of the entity, 
accreditation decision, and monitoring accreditation.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the second REAL-PANLAR consensus paper with the purpose to 
define the parameters for the accreditation process for future CoE in RA in LA.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy on 
clinical and inflammatory parameters in patients with moderate to severe chronic 
periodontitis (CP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (RA-CP) with that in CP 
patients without RA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with RA-CP and 18 systemically healthy 
patients with CP were treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) within 24 h. 
At baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after SRP, clinical periodontal parameters, 
inflammatory markers, and microorganisms in subgingival biofilm were assessed. 
In addition, disease activity markers of RA (DAS28, CRP, ESR) and specific 
antibodies (RF) were monitored in the RA-CP group.
RESULTS: In both groups, non-surgical therapy yielded to statistically 
significant improvements in all investigated clinical periodontal variables; in 
RA patients, a statistically significant decrease in serum-CRP was seen at 
3 months. At all time-points, levels of inflammatory markers in GCF were higher 
in RA-CP than in CP patients. Counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella 
forsythia, and Treponema denticola decreased statistically significantly in CP 
but not in the RA-CP group. Changes of DAS28 correlated positively with those of 
P. gingivalis and negatively with the plaque index.
CONCLUSIONS: Within their limits, the present data suggest that (a) non-surgical 
periodontal therapy improves periodontal conditions in CP patients with and 
without RA and (b) in patients with RA, eradication of P. gingivalis in 
conjunction with a high level oral hygiene may transiently decrease disease 
activity of RA.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with RA and CP, non-surgical periodontal therapy 
is a relevant modality not only to improve the periodontal condition but also to 
decrease RA activity.

We report a unique case of a Japanese woman with herpetiform pemphigus (HP) who 
had IgG autoantibodies reactive with nondesmosomal sites of keratinocytes and 
presented characteristic transmission electron microscopic (TEM) findings of 
various-sized vacuoles in keratinocytes without acantholysis. The patient 
presented with pruritic annular oedematous erythemas with small blisters lining 
the margins on the trunk and extremities. Histopathological examinations showed 
intraepidermal blisters with prominent infiltrations of eosinophils. Direct and 
indirect immunofluorescence tests revealed the presence of in vivo bound and 
circulating IgG autoantibodies to the keratinocyte cell surfaces. However, 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for desmoglein (Dsg) 1, Dsg3 and desmocollins 
1-3 showed negative results. Immunoblotting using the full-length human Dsg1 
recombinant protein showed a positive band. TEM examination showed various-sized 
vacuoles squashing the nuclei in many keratinocytes, resulting in rupture of the 
cells. Immunoelectron microscopic examination revealed IgG deposition over the 
entire keratinocyte cell surfaces, which spared the desmosomes. IgG antibodies 
were also present on the inside walls of the vacuoles around the nuclei of 
keratinocytes and on the cell surfaces of infiltrating eosinophils. This patient 
also had marked eosinophilia and high levels of thymus and activation-regulated 
chemokine and interleukin-5 in the serum. These results indicated a novel 
autoantigen on the nondesmosomal keratinocyte cell surfaces and the pathogenesis 
of bullous spongiotic change with inflammation in HP.

PURPOSE: To assess the plasma oxysterol species 7-ketocholesterol (7-Kchol) and 
cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (chol-triol) as biomarkers of oxidative stress in type 
1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: In total, 26 type 1 and 80 type 2 diabetes patients, along with 205 
age- and gender-matched healthy controls, were included in this study. 
Oxysterols were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry and N,N-dimethylglycine derivatization. Correlations between 
oxysterols and clinical/biochemical characteristics of the diabetes patients, 
and factors affecting 7-Kchol and chol-triol, were also determined.
RESULTS: Plasma 7-Kchol and chol-triol levels were significantly higher in type 
1 and type 2 diabetes patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). 
Significant positive correlations were observed between oxysterol levels and 
levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose, serum total cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein, very-low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides, as 
well as the number of coronary risk factors. Statins, oral hypoglycemic agents, 
and antihypertensive agents reduced the levels of oxysterols in type 2 diabetes 
patients. Statin use, HbA1c levels, and the number of coronary risk factors 
accounted for 98.8% of the changes in 7-Kchol levels, and total cholesterol, 
smoking status, and the number of coronary risk factors accounted for 77.3% of 
the changes in chol-triol levels in type 2 diabetes patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma oxysterol levels in DM, and particularly type 2 DM, may 
yield complementary information regarding oxidative stress for the clinical 
follow-up of diabetes patients, especially those with coronary risk factors.

Education and Research, Kolkata, India.

OBJECTIVE: We report comparative efficacy between high-dose cyclophosphamide 
(HDCyC), low-dose cyclophosphamide (LDCyC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 
rituximab in patients with lupus nephritis (LN).
METHODS: We analyzed comparative efficacy of 4 induction regimens of 
biopsy-proven LN: LDCyC: 500 mg fortnightly, HDCyC: 750 to 1200 mg monthly, MMF: 
1.5 to 3 g/d, and rituximab. Outcomes of 4 groups were analyzed at the sixth 
month.
RESULTS: Among a total 222 patients, 26 received LDCyC (3-g total dose), 113 
received HDCyC (mean, 5.1-g total dose), 61 received MMF (mean, 2.2 g/d), and 22 
received rituximab (mean, 1.9-g total dose). Relapsing/refractory LN was 11 in 
HDCyC, 1 in LDCyC, 10 in MMF, and 14 in the rituximab group. Overall 16.2% had 
no improvement of proteinuria, 18% had partial response, and 65.8% (146/222) had 
complete response. Renal response (RR) was higher in HDCyC (90.3%) and rituximab 
(90.9%) groups compared with LDCyC (73%) and MMF (72%) groups. Rituximab was 
effective in relapsing disease (100% RR). Infection was highest with the HDCyC, 
followed by LDCyC and rituximab (p = 0.15), whereas the MMF group had a higher 
incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects (p < 0.001). The following 
predictors of RR were identified: rituximab (odds ratio [OR], 20.4; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.9-215.7; p = 0.012), renal Baseline Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index at baseline (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99; p 
= 0.034), and duration of disease (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: High-dose cyclophosphamide and rituximab were the most effective 
therapeutic strategies in patients with LN, especially in the Indian context. 
Rituximab was highly effective in relapsing disease.

C1s deficiency is strongly associated with the development of human systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, the mechanisms by which C1s deficiency 
contributes to the development of SLE have not yet been elucidated in detail. 
Using ICR-derived-glomerulonephritis (ICGN) mouse strain that develops SLE and 
very weakly expresses C1s in the liver, we investigated the protective roles of 
C1s against SLE. A genetic sequence analysis revealed complete deletion of the 
C1s1 gene, a mouse homolog of the human C1s gene, with partial deletion of the 
C1ra and C1rb genes in the ICGN strain. This deletion led to the absence of 
C1r/C1s and a low level of C1q in the circulation. In order to investigate 
whether the C1r/C1s deficiency induces SLE, we produced a congenic mouse strain 
by introducing the deletion region of ICGN into the C57BL/6 strain. Congenic 
mice exhibited no C1r/C1s and a low level of C1q in the circulation, but did not 
have any autoimmune defects. These results suggest that C1r/C1s deficiency is 
not sufficient to drive murine SLE and also that other predisposing genes exist 
in ICGN mice.

In clinical trials, a placebo response refers to improvement in disease symptoms 
arising from the psychological effect of receiving a treatment rather than the 
actual treatment under investigation. Previous research has reported genomic 
variation associated with the likelihood of observing a placebo response, but 
these studies have been limited in scope and have not been validated. Here, we 
analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 784 patients undergoing placebo 
treatment in Phase III Asthma or Rheumatoid Arthritis trials to assess the 
impact of previously reported variation on patient outcomes in the placebo arms 
and to identify novel variants associated with the placebo response. Contrary to 
expectations based on previous reports, we did not observe any statistically 
significant associations between genomic variants and placebo treatment outcome. 
Our findings suggest that the biological origin of the placebo response is 
complex and likely to be variable between disease areas.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring of mycophenolic acid (MPA) levels may be useful for 
effective mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosing. However, whether commonly obtained 
trough levels are an acceptable method of surveillance remains debatable. We 
hypothesized that trough levels of MPA would be a poor predictor of area under 
the curve (AUC) for MPA.
METHODS: A total of 51 patients with lupus nephritis who were on MMF 1500 mg 
twice a day and had a 4-h AUC done were included in this study. MPA levels were 
measured prior to (C0) and at 1 (C1), 2 (C2) and 4 (C4) h, followed by 1500 mg 
of MMF. The MPA AUC values were calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. 
Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between the MPA trough 
and AUC. Differences in the MPA trough and AUC between different clinical and 
demographic categories were compared using t-tests.
RESULTS: When grouped by tertiles there was significant overlap in MPA, AUC 0-4 
and MPA trough in all tertiles. Although there was a statistically significant 
correlation between MPA trough levels and AUC, this association was weak and 
accounted for only 30% of the variability in MPA trough levels. This 
relationship might be even more unreliable in men than women. The use of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers was 
associated with increased MPA trough levels and AUC at 0-4 h (AUC0-4).
CONCLUSION: Trough levels of MPA do not show a strong correlation with AUC. In 
clinical situations where MPA levels are essential to guide therapy, an AUC0-4 
would be a better indicator of the adequacy of treatment.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with prothrombotic alterations, and 
postprandial hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular 
complications. We therefore investigated whether a standardized mixed meal 
alters circulating microparticles (MPs) and their procoagulant activity in DM 
patients. Patients with DM type 1 (T1DM, n = 11) and type 2 (T2DM; n = 9) were 
studied before and 90 min after a standardized meal (without premeal insulin). 
MPs in plasma derived from platelets (PMPs), endothelial cells (EMPs), or 
monocytes (MMPs) were measured by flow cytometry. MP-induced thrombin generation 
in plasma was assessed by a calibrated automated thrombogram. In the fasting 
state, MPs did not differ significantly between T1DM and T2DM. Meal intake 
increased the following microparticles: PMPs expressing phosphatidylserine (by 
55%, on average), P-selectin (by 86%), and tissue factor (TF; by 112%); EMPs 
expressing E-selectin (by 96%) and MMPs expressing TF (by 164%), with no 
significant group differences between T1DM and T2DM. There were no increments in 
EMPs expressing phosphatidylserine or TF. Meal intake increased MP-induced 
thrombin generation similarly in T1DM and T2DM with increased endogenous 
thrombin potential (p = 0.02) and peak thrombin (p = 0.03) and shortened time to 
peak (p = 0.02). Phosphatidylserine inhibition by lactadherin completely 
abolished MP-induced thrombin generation, while an anti-TF antibody had no 
effect. In conclusion, meal intake increased several types of circulating MPs in 
patients with diabetes mellitus. These MPs have a procoagulant potential, which 
is related to phosphatidylserine expression and negatively charged MP surfaces 
rather than to TF.

    Rheumatology (Oxford). 2019 Feb 1;58(2):187-188.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this national study in Sweden of patients with RA were 
to: examine the prevalence of sustained remission (SR), that is, remission 
lasting for at least 6 months; compare the prevalence of SR in patients with 
early RA and established RA; study the timing of onset of and time spent in SR; 
and study possible predictors of SR.
METHODS: Adult patients with RA included in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality 
registry were studied. The registry was searched for patients fulfilling 
remission criteria: DAS28-ESR, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), 
Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and ACR/EULAR remission for at least 6 
months. Early RA was defined as symptom duration ⩽6 months at inclusion in the 
Swedish Rheumatology Quality.
RESULTS: Of 29 084 patients, 12 193 (41.9%) reached DAS28 SR at some time point 
during follow-up compared with 6445 (22.2%), 6199 (21.3%) and 5087 (17.5%) for 
CDAI, SDAI and ACR/EULAR SR, respectively. SR was more common in early RA (P < 
0.001). The median time from symptom onset to SR was 1.9, 2.4, 2.4 and 2.5 years 
according to DAS28, CDAI, SDAI and ACR/EULAR criteria, respectively. Lower age, 
male sex and milder disease characteristics were associated with SR.
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients in this nationwide study never reached SR. 
Patients with early RA are more likely to reach SR than patients with 
established RA.

Genetic polymorphism (rs1800693) of TNFRSF1A (type 1 tumour necrosis factor 
receptor) encodes a potentially anti-inflammatory soluble truncated form of the 
p55 receptor, which is associated with predisposition to multiple sclerosis but 
protection against ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We analysed 2917 UK Caucasian 
cases by linear and logistic regression for associations of rs1800693 with 
disease severity assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis measures of disease 
activity and function (BASDAI, BAS-G and BASFI) and/or responses to anti-TNF 
therapy. In contrast to predictions, rs1800693 GG homozygotes actually had 
significantly worse BASDAI (mean 4.2, 95% CI: 4-4.5) than AA homozygotes (mean 
3.8, 95% CI: 3.7-4) in both the unadjusted (difference = 0.4, p = 0.006) and 
adjusted analyses (difference = 0.2-0.5, p = 0.002-0.04 depending on the 
adjustment model). We found no evidence that rs1900693 predicted functional 
status (BASFI) or global disease scores (BAS-G), and it exerted no influence on 
either the intention to treat with or efficacy of anti-TNF treatment.

We performed a dual-task experiment to explore the effect of nabiximols on 
postural control in 22 patients with multiple sclerosis. They were assessed with 
static posturography and Stroop test in single- and dual-task conditions at 
treatment start and after 1, 3 and 12 months. At follow-up, we found more 
impaired postural control in single-task ( F = 3.07, p = 0.044) and dual-task ( 
F = 4.90, p = 0.005) conditions in patients who continued treatment (continuers, 
n = 11) compared with those who discontinued (quitters, n = 11). Continuers were 
more impaired at Stroop test only in dual-task condition ( F = 3.17, p = 0.038). 
Our findings suggest that nabiximols had a detrimental effect on postural 
control, especially in multi-tasking conditions.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at an increased risk of 
Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD). We aimed to identify 
factors associated with MAC-PD in RA patients, and investigate their clinical 
significance for diagnosis of this disease.
METHODS: We examined 396 patients with RA for the presence of MAC-PD, using the 
criteria of the American Thoracic Society and conducted three years of follow-up 
on these patients. Multivariate logistic analyses were employed for selecting 
factors associated with MAC-PD. We developed a point system based on these 
factors which we call MAC-PD score to improve diagnosis of MAC-PD.
RESULTS: During this study, 14 out of 396 patients were newly diagnosed with 
MAC-PD. Multivariate analyses revealed body mass index (BMI) <18.0 kg/m2 and 
lymphocyte count <1500/μl were associated with MAC-PD in RA patients. Points 
were assigned to them and totalled to provide the MAC-PD score. Among 20 
patients with high-resolution computer tomography images consistent with MAC-PD, 
the scores were significantly higher in 14 patients with MAC-PD than those in 
six patients without MAC-PD.
CONCLUSION: Using these data, in the forms of the MAC-PD score, could help to 
identify patients who should be considered for bronchoscopy more selectively.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate systemic disease activity 
of pediatric Sjögren's syndrome (SS) using European League Against Rheumatism 
(EULAR) Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with SS who 
have been diagnosed according to 1999 Japanese diagnostic criteria for SS before 
16 years old at KKR Sapporo Medical Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, and 
affiliated hospitals. We analyzed clinical and laboratory data and calculated 
ESSDAI at both diagnosis and peak activity.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (2 boys and 23 girls) were enrolled. Only 4 
patients had sicca symptoms at diagnosis. Mean ESSDAI scores at diagnosis and 
peak activity were 12.68 (2-31) and 15.08 (2-38), respectively. Only 3 patients 
were inactive (ESSDAI score <5) at diagnosis. Frequently involved domains at 
diagnosis were the biological (96%) followed by the constitutional (68%), 
glandular (44%), articular (44%), cutaneous domains (28%), renal (16%), and 
central nervous system (12%). At peak activity, biological domain (96%) was 
followed by the constitutional (72%), glandular (60%), articular (44%), 
cutaneous (28%), central nervous system (20%), and renal domains (16%).
CONCLUSION: Pediatric SS is suspected from active systemic manifestations. The 
items of ESSDAI are useful clues to the diagnosis of pediatric SS.

INTRODUCTION: MODY diabetes encompasses heterogeneous group of monogenic forms 
of diabetes with low prevalence. It is not easily diagnosed because of the 
increase in obesity and family history of diabetes in the general population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present a clinical case with cardinal symptoms, 
diabetes,renal insufficiency with no acidosis and with a family history of 
diabetes and renal agenesis.
RESULTS: Distinguishing MODY diabetes from DM1 and DM2 is very important to 
ensure optimal treatment, and because the risk of complications depends on each 
genetic defect. A proper diagnosis needs a detailed medical history.
DISCUSSION: An earlier identification of family members at risk and a correct 
and individualised treatment could be possible. Many of these patients can be 
managed successfully in monotherapy without insulin therapy.

Pollution has long been incriminated in many cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases. More recently, studies evaluated the potential role for particulate 
pollutants in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The 
incidence of RA was found to be higher in urban areas. Living near air pollution 
emitters was associated with higher risks of developing RA and of producing 
RA-specific autoantibodies. Nevertheless, no strong epidemiological evidence 
exists to link one or more specific air pollution particles to RA. The presence 
in the bronchi of lymphoid satellite islands (inducible bronchus-associated 
lymphoid tissue, iBALT) is strongly associated with both inflammatory lung 
disease and RA-associated lung disease. Diesel exhaust particles can stimulate 
iBALT formation. The induction by air pollution of an inflammatory environment 
with high citrullination levels in the lung may induce iBALT formation, thereby 
causing a transition toward a more specific immune response via the production 
of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies. Air pollution not only triggers innate 
immune responses at the molecular level, increasing the levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, but is also involved in 
adaptive immune responses. Thus, via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), diesel 
exhaust particles can trigger a T-cell switch to the Th17 profile. Finally, in 
the murine collagen-induced arthritis model, animals whose lymphocytes lack the 
AHR develop milder arthritis.

Due to the paucity of evidence, this study was conducted to evaluate: (1) unique 
characteristics of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and (2) short-term clinical 
outcomes, of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with MS (MS-TKA) 
compared with matched non-MS patients. MS patients who underwent TKA were 
identified using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. The study 
sample consisted of 10,884 patients with MS and 56,45,227 control cohort. 
Various patient factors were compared. To control for potential confounders, 
with the use of propensity scores, MS-TKA patients were matched (1:3) to 
non-MS-TKA patients and regression analyses were performed to compare 
perioperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and discharge dispositions. 
Patients with MS were younger, more likely to be females, on corticosteroids, 
and more likely to have muscle spasms and gait abnormalities. Annual frequency 
of TKAs in MS patients increased from 1.16/1,000 TKAs in 2002 to 2.48/1,000 TKAs 
in 2013 (p < 0.001). Compared with the matched cohort, MS patients had 
significantly greater odds for any medical complication (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.44), longer mean LOS (mean difference: 
0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.22), and had a greater chance of being discharged to a care 
facility (OR = 2.17; 95% CI, 1.96-2.40). In this study, we identified specific 
characteristics of patients with MS who had TKA and analyzed and compared their 
short-term TKA outcomes to non-MS patients. It was demonstrated that more 
patients with MS are undergoing TKA, and these patients were at a higher risk of 
perioperative complications, had longer LOS, and were more likely to be 
discharged to a sub-acute or inpatient facility. Orthopaedic surgeons should be 
cognizant of the increased risks and provide proper counseling to MS patients 
who are candidates for TKA.

Purpose: To report the cases of two patients who presented with acute 
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and associated retinal pigment epithelium 
detachment (PED). Methods: 2 case reports. Case 1: A 22-year-old male patient 
complained of acute bilateral decrease in vision. Initial best corrected visual 
acuity (BCVA) was 20/63, OU. There was 1+ vitreous cells, OU, exudative retinal 
detachment (ERD) in the right eye (RE), and a macular deep yellow lesion 
suggestive of PED in the left eye (LE). Case 2: A 40-year-old female patient 
presented with bilateral vision blurring. BCVA was 20/40 in the RE and 20/32 in 
the LE. There was 1+ vitreous cells OU, bilateral optic disc swelling and 
retinal striae. Results: Multimodal imaging showed features of acute VKH disease 
with associated PED in the two patients. ERD and PED resolved under oral 
prednisone and cyclosporine in both cases. Conclusion: PED may rarely occur in 
acute VKH disease at presentation.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of renal involvement in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic 
autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is of major clinical importance 
to allow prompt initiation of treatment and limit renal damage. Urinary soluble 
cluster of differentiation 163 (usCD163) has recently been identified as a 
potential biomarker for active renal vasculitis. However, a significant number 
of patients with active renal vasculitis test negative using usCD163. We 
therefore studied whether soluble CD25 (sCD25), a T cell activation marker, 
could improve the detection of renal flares in AAV.
METHODS: sCD25 and sCD163 levels in serum and urine were measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 72 patients with active renal AAV, 20 with 
active extrarenal disease, 62 patients in remission and 18 healthy controls. 
Urinary and blood CD4+ T and CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cell counts were 
measured in 22 patients with active renal vasculitis. Receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) curves were generated and recursive partitioning was used 
to calculate whether usCD25 and serum soluble CD25 (ssCD25) add utility to 
usCD163.
RESULTS: usCD25, ssCD25 and usCD163 levels were significantly higher during 
active renal disease and significantly decreased after induction of remission. A 
combination of usCD25, usCD163 and ssCD25 outperformed all individual markers 
(sensitivity 84.7%, specificity 95.1%). Patients positive for sCD25 but negative 
for usCD163 (n = 10) had significantly higher C-reactive protein levels and 
significantly lower serum creatinine and proteinuria levels compared with the 
usCD163-positive patients. usCD25 correlated positively with urinary CD4+ T and 
CD4+ TEM cell numbers, whereas ssCD25 correlated negatively with circulating 
CD4+ T and CD4+ TEM cells.
CONCLUSION: Measurement of usCD25 and ssCD25 complements usCD163 in the 
detection of active renal vasculitis.

A recent meta-analysis revealed the contribution of the SIGLEC6 locus to the 
risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, no specific 
Siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) genes (Siglecs) have 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. Here, we performed in silico 
analysis of the function of three major protective alleles in the locus and 
found that these alleles were expression quantitative trait loci that enhanced 
expression of the adjacent SIGLEC12 gene. These data suggest that SIGLEC12 may 
protect against the development of SLE in Asian populations. Consistent with 
human genetic data, we identified two missense mutations in lupus-prone 
B6.NZMSle1/Sle2/Sle3 (Sle1-3) mice in Siglece, which is the murine Siglec with 
the greatest homology to human SIGLEC12. Since the mutations resulted in reduced 
binding of Siglec E to splenic cells, we evaluated whether Siglece-/- mice had 
SLE phenotypes. We found that Siglece-/- mice showed increased autoantibody 
production, glomerular immune complex deposition and severe renal pathology 
reminiscent of human SLE nephropathy. Our data demonstrate that the Siglec genes 
confer resistance to SLE in mice and humans.

Oral Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis.

Faissner S(1), Gold R(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, 44791 
Bochum, Germany.

Multiple sclerosis treatment faces tremendous changes owing to the approval of 
new medications, some of which are available as oral formulations. Until now, 
the four orally available medications, fingolimod, dimethylfumarate (BG-12), 
teriflunomide, and cladribine have received market authorization, whereas 
laquinimod is still under development. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate 
inhibitor, which is typically used as escalation therapy and leads to up to 60% 
reduction of the annualized relapse rate, but might also have neuroprotective 
properties. In addition, there are three more specific S1P agonists in late 
stages of development: siponimod, ponesimod, and ozanimod. Dimethylfumarate has 
immunomodulatory and cytoprotective functions and is used as baseline therapy. 
Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of the rheumatoid arthritis medication 
leflunomide, targets the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, thus inhibiting the 
proliferation of lymphocytes by depletion of pyrimidines. Here we will review 
the mechanisms of action, clinical trial data, as well as data about safety and 
tolerability of the compounds.

Purpose: Recent studies have reported that IL-35 has a protective effect in 
autoimmune disease. In this study, we explored the role of IL-35 in the 
pathogenesis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. Methods: The IL-35/EBI3 and 
IL-35/P35 mRNA level was assayed by Real-Time PCR. The level of IL-35 in serum 
was detected by ELISA. PBMCs and monocyte-derived DCs were cultured with or 
without IL-35 and the concentration of IL-17, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, and 
IL-1β in supernatants was tested by ELISA. Results: The serum level of IL-35 is 
reduced in active VKH patients. The mRNA expression of the two subunits 
IL-35/EBI3 and IL-35/P35 in PBMCs from patients with active VKH was also 
decreased. IL-35 significantly inhibited IFN-γ and IL-17 expression and induced 
IL-10 production by PBMCs and inhibited IL-6 production by monocyte-derived DCs. 
Conclusion: The current study suggests that a decreased IL-35 expression may be 
involved in the pathogenesis of VKH disease.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 
biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) by analyzing claims 
data of 13 Japanese national university hospitals.
METHODS: We evaluated 4970 cases of rheumatoid arthritis treated with bDMARDs 
from the Clinical Information Statistical Analysis database, which has collected 
and integrated 13 Japanese national university hospitals' claims data for 10 
years. We surveyed the medications and calculated the retention rates of bDMARDs 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and differentiated the effectiveness between the 
two bDMARDs by comparing the retention rates after switching from one drug to 
another.
RESULTS: Of the 4970 cases, 1364 switched bDMARDs at least once. Tocilizumab 
(TCZ) reported the highest retention rate, whereas abatacept (ABT) revealed a 
similar rate compared with only naïve cases. The retention rate curves were 
higher in cases on TCZ that switched from the other bDMARDs than those in the 
reversed cases. Following TCZ, ABT and etanercept indicated better results than 
the other bDMARDs.
CONCLUSION: We could compare the effectiveness among bDMARDs by differentiating 
the retention rates from big claims data. TCZ reported higher retention rates in 
both naïve and switched cases than other bDMARDs.

Innovative Therapeutic Potential of Cannabinoid Receptors as Targets in 
Alzheimer's Disease and Less Well-Known Diseases.

The discovery of cannabinoid receptors at the beginning of the 1990s, CB1 cloned 
in 1990 and CB2 cloned in 1993, and the availability of selective and potent 
cannabimimetics could only be justified by the existence of endogenous ligands 
that are capable of binding to them. Thus, the characterisation and cloning of 
the first cannabinoid receptor (CB1) led to the isolation and characterisation 
of the first endocannabinoid, arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA), two years later 
and the subsequent identification of a family of lipid transmitters known as the 
fatty acid ester 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). The endogenous cannabinoid 
system is a complex signalling system that comprises transmembrane 
endocannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands (the endocannabinoids), the 
specific uptake mechanisms and the enzymatic systems related to their 
biosynthesis and degradation. The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in 
a wide diversity of biological processes, in both the central and peripheral 
nervous systems, including memory, learning, neuronal development, stress and 
emotions, food intake, energy regulation, peripheral metabolism, and the 
regulation of hormonal balance through the endocrine system. In this context, 
this article will review the current knowledge of the therapeutic potential of 
cannabinoid receptor as a target in Alzheimer's disease and other less 
well-known diseases that include, among others, multiple sclerosis, bone 
metabolism, and Fragile X syndrome. The therapeutic applications will be 
addressed through the study of cannabinoid agonists acting as single drugs and 
multi-target drugs highlighting the CB2 receptor agonist.

Genetic variants near the tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 3 gene 
(TNFAIP3) at the chromosomal region 6q23 demonstrated significant associations 
with multiple autoimmune diseases. The signals of associations have been 
explained to the TNFAIP3 gene, the most likely causal gene. In this study, we 
employed CRISPR/cas9 genome-editing tool to generate cell lines with deletions 
including a candidate causal variant, rs6927172, at 140 kb upstream of the 
TNFAIP3 gene. Interestingly, we observed alterations of multiple genes including 
IL-20RA encoding a subunit of the receptor for interleukin 20. Using 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), Western blotting, and chromatin 
conformation capture we characterized the molecular mechanism that the DNA 
element carrying the variant rs6927172 influences expression of IL-20RA and 
TNFAIP3 genes. Additionally, we developed a new use of the transcription 
activator-like effector (TALE) to study the role of the variant in regulating 
expressions of its target genes. In summary, we generated deletion knockouts 
that included the candidate causal variant rs6927172 in HEK293T cells provided 
new evidence and mechanism for IL-20RA gene as a risk factor for multiple 
autoimmune diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Cognitive fatigue (CF) can be defined as decreased performance with 
sustained cognitive effort. The present study examined the interrelatedness of 
disease severity, fatigue, depression, and sleep quality in order to evaluate 
their predictive roles of CF in MS. Four theoretical models examining these 
variables were assessed.
METHODS: Fifty-eight individuals with a diagnosis of MS were recruited. CF was 
measured by examining last third versus first third performance on the Paced 
Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). The PASAT and self-report measures of 
fatigue, depression, and sleep quality were administered. Path analysis was used 
to evaluate each of the models.
RESULTS: CF was correlated only with depression (r = .362, p = .006) and sleep 
quality (r = .433, p = .001). Sleep quality was the greatest significant 
independent predictor of CF (β = .433, t(1,55) = 3.53, p < .001), accounting for 
17.3% of the total variance. The best fitting model showed sleep quality as the 
largest contributor to CF; however, depression played a smaller predictive role. 
Furthermore, depression emerged as the strongest predictor of sleep quality and 
fatigue. Disease severity weakly predicted depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep quality is the most significant predictor of CF in MS. As 
such, sleep quality may be a treatable cause of CF. Sleep quality itself, 
however, accounted for only 17.3% of the variance in CF suggesting that other 
variables which were not formally assessed in this sample (e.g., anxiety, etc.) 
may also play a predictive role. Follow-up studies should evaluate how results 
may differ with a larger sample size.

Rheumatoid arthritis is considered a T-lymphocyte-mediated disease. However, 
studies have focussed on CD4 T-lymphocytes, ignoring CD8 T-lymphocytes despite 
the latter being found abundantly in the synovium. Specifically, there is little 
data of the effect of methotrexate, the gold-standard DMARD, on various CD8 
cytokine T-lymphocyte subsets and conflicting data on CD4 subsets. In this 
prospective study, patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, who were 18 to 
65 years of age, were treated with methotrexate (up to 25 mg per week) for 
24 weeks. At baseline and 24 weeks, frequencies of CD8+IFNγ+, CD8+IL17+, 
CD8+IL4+, corresponding CD4 subsets and plasma levels of IFNγ, IL-12, IL-10, 
IL-4 and IL-17 were determined by flow cytometry. These are summarised as median 
(IQR = interquartile range, 25th-75th percentile) and paired data compared using 
Wilcoxon signed rank test. This study included 67 patients (F/M = 4:1) with 
rheumatoid arthritis, 57 (85%) being RF positive and 20 receiving prednisolone 
at baseline. Mean (± SD) dose of methotrexate at 24 weeks was 22.9 ± 3.0 mg per 
week. On treatment with methotrexate, there was a significant (p = 0.04) decline 
in CD8+IFNγ+ cells from 37.2 (IQR 19.4-60.2) to 22.7% (IQR 8.5-49.7) and a 
marginal increase in CD8+IL17+ cells from 0.3 (IQR 0.1-0.6) to 0.4 (IQR 
0.2-1.2), p = 0.006. There was no significant change in the other subsets. There 
was also a significant decline in circulating levels of IL-12, IL-10 and IL-17 
and marginal increase in IL-4. On evaluating by response, non-responders but not 
responders had a significant increase in CD8+IL17+ (p = 0.01). There is a 
significant decline of CD8+IFNγ+ T cells and marginal increase in CD8+IL17+ T 
cells after methotrexate. Change in Tc1 subset may be mediated through reduction 
in IL-12 levels.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines advise that rituximab or cyclophosphamide should 
be used for the treatment of organ-threatening disease in anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), although few studies have 
examined the efficacy and safety of these agents in combination.
METHODS: We conducted a single-centre cohort study of 66 patients treated with a 
combination of oral corticosteroids, rituximab and low-dose pulsed intravenous 
cyclophosphamide followed by a maintenance regimen of azathioprine and tapered 
steroid for the treatment of biopsy-proven renal involvement in AAV. Patients 
were followed for a median of 56 months. Case-control analysis with 198 
propensity-matched cases from European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS) trials 
compared long-term differences in relapse-free, renal and patient survival.
RESULTS: At entry, the median Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) was 19 
and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 25 mL/min. Cumulative doses of 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids were 2, 3 and 4.2 g, 
respectively, at 6 months. A total of 94% of patients achieved disease remission 
by 6 months (BVAS < 0) and patient and renal survival were 84 and 95%, 
respectively, at 5 years. A total of 84% achieved ANCA-negative status and 57% 
remained B cell deplete at 2 years, which was associated with low rates of major 
relapse (15% at 5 years). The serious infection rate during long-term follow-up 
was 1.24 per 10 patient-years. Treatment with this regimen was associated with a 
reduced risk of death {hazard ratio [HR] 0.29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.125-0.675], P = 0.004}, progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [HR 0.20 
(95% CI 0.06-0.65), P = 0.007] and relapse [HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.25-0.97), 
P = 0.04] compared with propensity-matched patients enrolled in EUVAS trials.
CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is potentially superior to current standards of care, 
and controlled studies are warranted to establish the utility of combination 
drug approaches in the treatment of AAV.

Purpose: To assess treatment outcomes in juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(JIA)-associated uveitis and relapse rates upon discontinuation of 
immunomodulatory therapy (IMT). Methods: Medical records of patients with 
JIA-associated uveitis seen at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the 
F.I. Proctor Foundation uveitis clinics from September 14, 1988 to January 5, 
2011 were reviewed. The main outcome was time to relapse after attempting to 
discontinue IMT.Results: Of 66 patients with JIA-associated uveitis, 51 (77%) 
received IMT as either sole or combination therapy. Of a total of 51, 41 (80%) 
patients achieved corticosteroid-sparing control. Attempts were made to 
discontinue treatment in 19/51 (37%) patients. Of a total of 19 patients, 13 
(68%) attempting to discontinue IMT relapsed, with a median time to relapse of 
288 days from the time of attempted taper/discontinuation (IQR: 
108-338).Conclusions: Corticosteroid-sparing control of inflammation was 
achieved in the majority of patients; however, attempts to stop IMT were often 
unsuccessful. Close follow-up of patients after discontinuation of therapy is 
warranted.

OBJECTIVES: To establish a new assessment tool for ulnar drift (UD) in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: We established an observational cohort of 67 patients (134 rheumatoid 
hands) beginning in 2004. Fifty-two patients (100 hands) had follow-up in 2009 
and 37 patients (63 hands) completed follow-up in 2015. UD was evaluated with 
the Fearnley classification and our scoring method, which assesses four 
parameters of the metacarpophalangeal joint. Cluster analysis using UD 
parameters divided hands into groups. Changes in UD over time, correlation of 
the Fearnley stage and cluster with a functional assessment, and reliability of 
the parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: UD increased and worsened over time according to the trend test. A 
dendrogram indicated five clusters would be appropriate. Both the Fearnley 
classification and cluster were associated with function; however, our method 
related to function more linearly (R-squared: 0.42). We found one type of hand 
in which bone destruction precedes the joint dislocation and one type in which 
joint dislocation progresses with little deviation during UD progression.
CONCLUSION: Our UD evaluation appeared to be simple and related to function. 
Additionally, it enables dividing UD hands into five stages. Thus, our 
assessment should be beneficial compared to the Fearnley classification in 
considering treatments of UD.

OBJECTIVES: To explore strategies used by physiotherapists (PTs) in guiding 
people with rheumatoid arthritis to health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) in 
a group setting during a 1-year intervention study.
METHODS: Exploratory design with qualitative video analysis performed in three 
steps. Eleven female PTs were video recorded while leading support group 
sessions aiming at facilitating HEPA (twice-weekly exercise sessions at public 
gyms and 150 weekly minutes of moderately intense aerobic physical activity).
RESULTS: Three categories of challenging situations emerged. They occurred when 
the HEPA intervention participants reported barriers to performing physical 
activity, when they neglected to use the planning tool for physical activity as 
intended in the program, and when they received negative results from physical 
capacity tests. PTs used different strategies to manage these challenges, with 
main focus either on information-giving, corresponding to a traditional health 
professional approach, or utilizing group resources by organizing participation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides detailed descriptions of PTs' clinical behavior 
in video-recorded sessions. The results imply that motivated PTs can, despite 
their biomedical and practitioner-focused training, learn to adapt their 
communication strategies to different situations, altering between traditional 
information-giving and utilizing group resources by organizing participation.

OBJECTIVES: High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) parenchymal patterns have 
been used to predict prognosis in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). 
In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the fibrosis score (i.e. the combined extent 
of reticulation and honeycombing) has been associated with worse survival. This 
study aimed to identify HRCT patterns and patient characteristics that can 
predict poor prognosis in rheumatoid arthritis-related ILD (RA-ILD).
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 65 patients with newly diagnosed RA-ILD 
from 2007 to 2016 at Kurashiki Central hospital. Using univariate and bivariate 
Cox regression analysis, associations with mortality, were identified.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 56.5 months, 16/65 (24.6%) patients died. 
Univariate analysis identified six significant poor prognostic factors: lower 
baseline % predicted forced vital capacity, total interstitial disease score, 
reticulation score, traction bronchiectasis score, fibrosis score, and definite 
UIP pattern. Fibrosis score remained to be an independently significant poor 
prognostic factor of survival on bivariate analysis. Patients with a fibrosis 
score >20% had higher mortality (HR, 9.019; 95% CI, 2.87-28.35; p < .05).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that fibrosis score is strongly associated with 
worse survival in RA-ILD, and patients with fibrosis score >20% had a 9.019-fold 
increased risk of mortality.

Plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pDC) are a specialized DC population with a 
great potential to produce large amounts of type I interferon (IFN). pDC are 
involved in the initiation of antiviral immune responses through their 
interaction with innate and adaptive immune cell populations. In a 
context-dependent manner, pDC activation can induce their differentiation into 
mature DC able to induce both T cell activation or tolerance. In this review, we 
described pDC functions during immune responses and their implication in the 
clearance or pathogenicity of human diseases during infection, autoimmunity, 
allergy and cancer. We discuss recent advances in the field of pDC biology and 
their implication for future studies.

Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a synthetic amino acid copolymer that is approved for 
treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and clinically 
isolated syndrome (CIS). GA reduces multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and 
has shown comparable efficacy with high-dose interferon-β. The mechanism of 
action (MOA) of GA has long been an enigma. Originally, it was recognized that 
GA treatment promoted expansion of GA-reactive T-helper 2 and regulatory T 
cells, and induced the release of neurotrophic factors. However, GA treatment 
influences both innate and adaptive immune compartments, and it is now 
recognized that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are the initial cellular targets 
for GA. The anti-inflammatory (M2) APCs induced following treatment with GA are 
responsible for the induction of anti-inflammatory T cells that contribute to 
its therapeutic benefit. Here, we review studies that have shaped our current 
understanding of the MOA of GA.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by 
synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, autoantibody production, cartilage and 
bone destruction and several systemic features. Cardiovascular, pulmonary, 
psychological, and muscle involvement are the main comorbidities of RA and are 
responsible for the severity of the disease and long-term prognosis. 
Pharmacological treatment of rheumatic diseases has evolved remarkably over the 
past years. In addition, the widespread adoption of treat to target and tight 
control strategies has led to a substantial improvement of outcomes, so that 
drug-free remission is nowadays a realistic goal in the treatment of RA. 
However, despite the availability of multiple therapeutic options, up to 40% of 
patients do not respond to current treatments, including biologics. 
Small-molecule therapies offer an alternative to biological therapies for the 
treatment of inflammatory diseases. In the past 5 years, a number of 
small-molecule compounds targeting Janus Kinases (JAKs) have been developed. 
Since JAKs are essential for cell signaling in immune cells, in particular 
controlling the response to many cytokines, their inhibitors quickly became a 
promising class of oral therapeutics that proved effective in the treatment of 
RA. Tofacitinib is the first Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for the 
treatment of RA, followed more recently by baricitinib. Several other JAK 
inhibitors, are currently being tested in phase II and III trials for the 
treatment of a different autoimmune diseases. Most of these compounds exhibit an 
overall acceptable safety profile similar to that of biologic agents, with 
infections being the most frequent adverse event. Apart from tofacitinib, safety 
data on other JAK inhibitors are still limited. Long-term follow-up and further 
research are needed to evaluate the general safety profile and the global risk 
of malignancy of these small molecules, although no clear association with 
malignancy has been reported to date. Here, we will review the main 
characteristics of JAK inhibitors, including details on their molecular targets 
and on the clinical evidences obtained so far in the treatment of RA.

Cysteine cathepsins have been for a long time considered to execute mainly 
nonspecific bulk proteolysis in the endolysosomal system. However, this view has 
been changing profoundly over the last decade as cathepsins were found in the 
cytoplasm, nucleus and in the extracellular milieu. Cathepsins are currently 
gaining increased attention largely because of their extracellular roles 
associated with disease development and progression. While kept under tight 
control under physiological conditions, their dysregulated and elevated activity 
in the extracellular milieu are distinctive hallmarks of numerous diseases such 
as various cancers, inflammatory disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, bone disorders 
and heart diseases. In this review, we discuss cysteine cathepsins with a major 
focus on their extracellular roles and extracellular proteolytic targets beyond 
degradation of the extracellular matrix. We further highlight the perspectives 
of cathepsin research and novel avenues in cathepsin-based diagnostic and 
therapeutic applications.

BACKGROUND: Despite impressive results of the pharmacological management of 
rheumatoid arthritis, still certain patients suffer from rheumatoid forefoot 
problems. Surgical treatment of these forefoot deformities can be an option. In 
literature no high-quality studies on this topic can be found. The goal of 
present study is to compare the results of a metatarsal head (MTH) resecting 
technique with a MTH preserving technique in the operative treatment of severe 
rheumatoid forefoot deformity.
METHODS: Patients suffering from well-defined rheumatoid forefoot deformity were 
prospectively enrolled in three institutions. This non-blinded study had a 
randomised clinical design and eligible patients were randomly assigned to 
undergo either resection of preservation of the MTH. The primary outcome measure 
consisted of the AOFAS score. Secondary outcome measures were: the FFI, the VAS 
for pain and the SF-36.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (10 in MTH preservation group) were included and 
analysed. After one year follow-up no significant differences in AOFAS score and 
additional outcome factors were found. A total of 10 complications in 23 
patients were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This randomised clinical study did not show significant clinical 
difference between a MTH resecting and a preserving procedure in patients 
suffering from rheumatoid forefoot deformity. Both procedures resulted in 
considerable improvement of pain and activity scores.

The effect of "prophylactic" environmental stimulation on clinical symptoms and 
presynaptic defects in mice suffering from the experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute stage of disease (21 ± 1 days post 
immunization, d.p.i.) was investigated. In EAE mice raised in an enriched 
environment (EE), the clinical score was reduced when compared to EAE mice 
raised in standard environment (SE).Concomitantly, gain of weight and increased 
spontaneous motor activity and curiosity were observed, suggesting increased 
well-being in mice. Impaired glutamate exocytosis and cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) production in cortical terminals of SE-EAE mice were 
evident at 21 ± 1 d.p.i.. Differently, the 12 mM KCl-evoked glutamate exocytosis 
from cortical synaptosomes of EE-EAE mice was comparable to that observed in SE 
and EE-control mice, but significantly higher than that in SE-EAE mice. 
Similarly, the 12 mM KCl-evoked cAMP production in EE-EAE mice cortical 
synaptosomes recovered to the level observed in SE and EE-control mice. MUNC-18 
and SNAP25 contents, but not Syntaxin-1a and Synaptotagmin 1 levels, were 
increased in cortical synaptosomes from EE-EAE mice when compared to SE-EAE 
mice. Circulating IL-1β was increased in the spinal cord, but not in the cortex, 
of SE-EAE mice, and it did not recover in EE-EAE mice. Inflammatory infiltrates 
were reduced in the cortex but not in the spinal cord of EE-EAE mice. 
Demyelination was observed in the spinal cord; EE significantly diminished it. 
We conclude that "prophylactic" EE is beneficial to synaptic derangements and 
preserves glutamate transmission in the cortex of EAE mice. This article is part 
of the Special Issue entitled "Neurobiology of Environmental Enrichment".

Encephalitis is a clinical syndrome which can include altered mental status, 
motor and sensory deficits, altered behavior including personality changes, 
speech and movement disorders and seizures. While the overall incidence of 
encephalitis is not known, it is common enough that most pediatric and 
adolescent medicine physicians will have seen at least one case. Peak times of 
risk include the newborn period and middle-to-late adolescence. 1 It is 
important for clinicians to have a working knowledge of the broad range of 
encephalitis etiologies: viral, post-viral, toxic, auto-immune, and 
paraneoplastic. We discuss two cases of encephalitis in young adult women with 
ovarian teratoma and production of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) 
antibodies.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem, autoimmune disorder and 
confers one of the strongest risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity 
and mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To assess myocardial function and vascular stiffness in RA patients 
with and without cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) using cardiovascular 
magnetic resonance (CMR).
METHODS: Twenty-three RA patients with no CVRFs (17 female, mean age 
52 ± 13 years), 46 RA patients with CVRFs (32 female, mean age 53 ± 12), 50 
normal controls (32 female, mean age 50 ± 11 years), and 13 controls with CVRFs 
(7 female, mean age 55 ± 7 years), underwent CMR at 1.5 Tesla, including 
evaluation of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, strain, and vascular 
elasticity (aortic distensibility [AD] and pulse wave velocity [PWV]). Disease 
activity and duration were recorded for each patient. Subjects with known 
symptomatic CVD were excluded.
RESULTS: LV volumes, mass, and ejection fraction were similar in the four 
groups. RA patients with CVRFs showed the greatest abnormality in mid short-axis 
circumferential systolic strain, peak diastolic strain rate, and vascular 
indices. RA patients without CVRFs showed a similar degree of vascular 
dysfunction and deformational abnormality as controls with CVRFs. AD and total 
PWV correlated with myocardial strain and RA disease activity. On multivariate 
regression analysis, strain was related to age, RA disease activity, AD, and 
PWV.
CONCLUSION: CMR demonstrates impaired myocardial deformation and vascular 
function in asymptomatic RA patients, worse in those with CVRFs. Subclinical 
cardiovascular abnormalities are frequent and appear to be incremental to those 
due to traditional CVRFs and likely contribute to the excess CVD in RA.

Binding of small molecules in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptide-binding 
groove may result in conformational changes of bound peptide and an altered 
immune response, but previous studies have not considered a potential role for 
endogenous metabolites. We performed virtual screening of the complete Human 
Metabolite Database (HMDB) for docking to the multiple sclerosis (MS) 
susceptible DRB1*15:01 allele and compared the results to the closely related 
yet non-susceptible DRB1*15:03 allele; and assessed the potential impact on 
binding of human myelin basic peptide (MBP). We observed higher energy scores 
for metabolite binding to DRB1*15:01 than DRB1*15:03. Structural comparison of 
docked metabolites with DRB1*15:01 and DRB1*15:03 complexed with MBP revealed 
that PhenylalanineMBP92 allows binding of metabolites in the P4 pocket of 
DRB1*15:01 but ValineMBP89 abrogates metabolite binding in the P1 pocket. We 
observed differences in the energy scores for binding of metabolites in the P4 
pockets of DRB1*15:01 vs. DRB1*15:03 suggesting stronger binding to DRB1*15:01. 
Our study confirmed that specific, disease-associated human metabolites bind 
effectively with the most polymorphic P4 pocket of DRB1*15:01, the primary MS 
susceptible allele in most populations. Our results suggest that endogenous 
human metabolites bound in specific pockets of HLA may be immunomodulatory and 
implicated in autoimmune disease.

B-Cell Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis.

San Francisco, California 94158.

B cells play a vital function in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis through an 
array of effector functions. All currently approved MS disease-modifying 
therapies alter the frequency, phenotype, or homing of B cells in one way or 
another. The importance of this mechanism of action has been reinforced with the 
successful development and clinical testing of B-cell-depleting monoclonal 
antibodies that target the CD20 surface antigen. Ocrelizumab, a humanized 
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in March 2017 after pivotal trials showed dramatic reductions in 
inflammatory disease activity in relapsing MS as well as lessening of disability 
progression in primary progressive MS. These and other clinical studies place B 
cells at the center of the inflammatory cascade in MS and provide a launching 
point for development of therapies that target selective pathogenic B-cell 
populations.

Astrocytes play complex roles in health and disease. Here, we review recent 
findings on molecular pathways that control astrocyte function in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) as well as new tools for their investigation. In particular, we 
describe positive and negative regulators of astrocyte-mediated pathogenesis in 
MS, such as sphingolipid metabolism and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, 
respectively. In addition, we also discuss the issue of astrocyte heterogeneity 
and its relevance for the contribution of astrocytes to MS pathogenesis. 
Finally, we discuss how new genomic tools could transform the study of astrocyte 
biology in MS.

We evaluated plasma glutamine levels and basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption 
rate (mOCRB) and basal extracellular acidification rate (ECARB) of peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) patients 
and healthy controls (HCs). Lower plasma glutamine levels correlated with higher 
SLE disease activity indexes (p=0.025). Incubated in DMEM containing 100mg/dL 
glucose, SLE-PBMCs displayed lower mOCRB (p=0.018) but similar ECARB (p=0.467) 
to those of HC-PBMCs, and their mOCRB got elevated (p<0.001) without altering 
ECARB (p=0.239) by supplementation with 2 or 4mM glutamine. We conclude that 
impaired mitochondrial respiration of SLE-PBMCs could be improved by glutamine 
under euglycemic condition.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the health-related 
quality of life in children and adolescents with autoimmune hepatitis.
METHODS: A cross-sectional assessment with the Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL 4.0) was completed for 80 patients with autoimmune 
hepatitis and 45 healthy controls. Demographic data, prednisone dose, disease 
remission state, disease severity, and abdominal pain were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Based on the child self-reports, physical, emotional, school, and total 
scores were significantly lower in autoimmune hepatitis patients when compared 
with controls (p<0.05). Based on the parental reports, only the physical and 
total scores were significantly lower in autoimmune hepatitis patients versus 
controls (p<0.05). Further analysis in autoimmune hepatitis patients with 
abdominal pain in the last month revealed significantly lower physical, social, 
and total median scores (p<0.05). No differences were observed based on disease 
remission state or disease severity (p>0.05). Autoimmune hepatitis patients who 
received a prednisone dose below 0.16mg/kg/day at the time of the interview 
showed significantly higher physical scores than those who received a dose 
similar to or above 0.16mg/kg/day (87.5 [50-100] vs. 75 [15.63-100], p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced scores in the physical, emotional, and school domains were 
observed in pediatric autoimmune hepatitis patients compared to control 
patients. Abdominal pain and corticosteroid dose negatively influenced the 
health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with autoimmune 
hepatitis.

The HLA-DQB1* region exhibits complex associations with autoimmune thyroid 
disease (AITD). AITD patients (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, HT = 180; Graves' 
disease, GD = 55) and age/sex matched controls (n = 235) were genotyped for 
DQB1* alleles by PCR-SSP. Alleles DQB1*02:02, *06:03, *06:09, *03:02, and *03:03 
showed an increased risk and *02:01, *05:02, and *06:02 showed a protection 
toward AITD. Multiple sequence alignment was used to find out the amino acid 
variations within the peptide-binding pockets of susceptible and/or protective 
DQB1* alleles. We observed susceptible associations for amino acids 
'Glu86(P < 0.0007)' and 'Leu87(P < 3.8 × 10-4)' in P1, 'Leu26(P < 4.0 × 10-12)' 
in P4, 'His9(P < 5.0 × 10-4)' and 'Ala57(P < 3.6 × 10-4)' in P9 toward HT; and 
'Gly86(P < 0.0004)' in P1 and 'Asp57(P < 1.9 × 10-4)' in P9 towards GD. 
Protective associations were observed for amino acids 'Ala86(P < 8.2 × 10-6)' 
and 'Tyr87(P < 0.0003)' in P1, 'Gly26(P < 4.9 × 10-5)' and 
'Ser74(P < 4.9 × 10-5)' in P4, 'Phe9(P < 0.0007)' and 'Ser57(P < 0.0016)' in P9 
towards HT. Thus, the present study revealed that DQB1* alleles and putative 
amino acid residues play an important role in susceptibility toward AITD in 
south India.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of socioeconomic and psychological factors 
on glycemic control in young children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study assessing prepubertal children with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus. The authors analyzed the socioeconomic status using 
the Brazil Economic Classification Criterion (Critério de Classificação 
Econômica Brasil [CCEB]) and psychological conditions through the Brazilian 
version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes, associated with glycemic control, 
measured by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Descriptive analysis was used. The 
variables were assessed by bivariate and multivariate robust Poisson regression 
model, as well as Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-squared tests to obtain the 
ratios of gross and adjusted prevalence ratio, with confidence interval being 
estimated at 95%.
RESULTS: A total of 68 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus were included in 
the study. A negative association between glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin 
levels), socioeconomic status (Brazil Economic Classification Criterion), and 
psychological condition (Brazilian version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes) was 
observed. Among the study participants, 73.5% (n=50) of the children had an 
unfavorable socioeconomic status; these participants were 1.4 times more likely 
to present altered glycated hemoglobin values. In relation to individuals with 
compromised psychological status, 26 (38.2%) had a score above 70, thus being 
classified with psychological stress; these children were 1.68 times more likely 
(95% confidence interval: 1.101, 1.301) to have higher glycated hemoglobin 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The socioeconomic conditions and psychological characteristics of 
the study participants were negatively associated with glycated hemoglobin 
results. These data reinforce the importance of the studied variables as 
predictors of glycemic control.

BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated 
syndrome (CIS) may show alterations of retinal layer architecture as measured by 
optical coherence tomography. Little is known about changes in the retinal 
vascular network during MS.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize retinal vessel structures in patients with MS and CIS 
and to test for associations with MS disease activity.
METHOD: In all, 42 patients with MS or CIS and 50 healthy controls underwent 
retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) with analysis of the 
superficial and deep vascular plexuses and the choriocapillaries. We tested 
OCT-A parameters for associations with retinal layer volumes, history of optic 
neuritis (ON), and the retrospective disease activity.
RESULTS: Inner retinal layer volumes correlated positively with the density of 
both the superficial and deep vascular plexuses. Eyes of MS/CIS patients with a 
history of ON revealed reduced vessel densities of the superficial and deep 
vascular plexuses as compared to healthy controls. Higher choriocapillary vessel 
densities were associated with ongoing inflammatory disease activity during 24 
months prior to OCT-A examination in MS and CIS patients.
CONCLUSION: Optic neuritis is associated with rarefaction of the superficial and 
deep retinal vessels. Alterations of the choriocapillaries might be linked to 
disease activity in MS.

OBJECTIVE: To determine patterns of blood glucose monitoring in children and 
adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) before and after routine T1D clinic 
visits.
METHODS: Blood glucose monitoring data were downloaded at four consecutive 
routine clinic visits from children and adolescents aged 5-18 years. Linear 
mixed models were used to analyze patterns of blood glucose monitoring in 
patients who had at least 28 days of data stored in their blood glucose 
monitors.
RESULTS: In general, the frequency of blood glucose monitoring decreased across 
visits, and younger children engaged in more frequent blood glucose monitoring. 
Blood glucose monitoring increased before the T1D clinic visits in younger 
children, but not in adolescents. It declined after the visit regardless of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Members of the T1D care team need to consider that a T1D clinic 
visit may prompt an increase in blood glucose monitoring when making treatment 
changes and recommendations. Tailored interventions are needed to maintain that 
higher level of adherence across time.

The complement system is a complex and autoregulated multistep cascade at the 
interface of innate and adaptive immunity. It is activated by immune complexes 
or apoptotic cells (classical pathway), pathogen-associated glycoproteins 
(lectin pathway) or a variety of molecular and cellular surfaces (alternative 
pathway). Upon activation, complement triggers the generation of proteolytic 
fragments that allow the elimination of the activating surface by enhancing 
inflammation, opsonization, phagocytosis, and cellular lysis. Moreover, 
complement efficiently discriminates self from non-self surfaces by means of 
soluble and membrane-bound complement regulators which are critical for innate 
self-tolerance. Complement deficiency or dysfunction disturb complement 
homeostasis and give rise to diseases as diverse as bacterial infections, 
autoimmunity, or renal and neurological disorders. Research on 
complement-targeted therapies is an expanding field that has already improved 
the prognosis of severe diseases such as atypical Haemolytic Uremic syndrome or 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria. Therefore, complement analysis and 
monitoring provides valuable information with deep implications for diagnosis 
and therapy. In addition to its important role as an extracellular defense 
system, it has now become evident that complement is also present 
intracellularly, and its activation has profound implications for leukocyte 
survival and function. In this review, we summarize the essential, up-to-date 
information on the use of complement as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the 
clinics.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of new-onset hypertension in patients with 
Rheumatoid arthritis taking leflunomide, in comparison with methotrexate in 
Asian setting.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Perspective case-control study was conducted in 2014 in a 
tertiary care hospital located in Karachi, Pakistan. Adult patients, having 
rheumatoid arthritis were randomly prescribed leflunomide or methotrexate. 
Patients having chronic hypertension, proteinuria and chronic kidney disease 
were excluded. Patients were monthly followed for blood pressure and heart rate 
measurements. Hypertension was defined using JNC 7 criteria.
RESULTS: Out of 144 patients enrolled, 80 patients received Leflunomide while 64 
were started on methotrexate. Mean systolic blood pressure in leflunomide group 
at the start and at the end of study was 108.5 and 135.4mmHg, respectively while 
in methotrexate group, mean systolic BP was 109.8 and 110.5 mmhg, respectively. 
After one year follow up, 33 out of 80 (41%) patients were receiving leflunomide 
had pre-hypertension or hypertension, while only 3 out of 64 patients (4.7%) 
were receiving methotrexate had hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Risk of developing hypertension in patient receiving Leflunomide is 
much higher in Asian population like Pakistan as compared to western population.

BACKGROUND: The Six Spot Step Test (SSST) extends traditional walking outcomes 
in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) by further challenging components of 
coordination and balance. Nonetheless, the test-retest agreement of the SSST has 
not been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the within-day, day-to-day, and inter-rater agreement 
and reliability of the SSST in PwMS. A secondary aim was to investigate the 
validity of handheld timing.
METHODS: A total of 38 PwMS with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) <6.5 
completed two SSSTs with a 5-minute break in-between. After 2 days, this 
procedure was repeated. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to determine the 95% 
Limits of Agreement (LOA) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was 
calculated. In a subgroup of 18 PwMS, the SSSTs were video-recorded and timed by 
a second investigator.
RESULTS: The relative LOA within and between days were ±15% and ±19%, while ICC 
were 0.987 and 0.983, respectively. A minor learning effect was found over four 
tests. The handheld timing error was ±0.5 seconds when compared to video-based 
timing.
CONCLUSION: The SSST has an acceptable within- and between-day agreement and 
reliability. For interventional purposes, a change of >19% can be regarded as a 
real change. Valid timing can be performed by a handheld stopwatch.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess outcomes and the 
detailed clinicopathological features of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), 
including the relation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postoperative pathological 
features in child under 18 years old.
METHODS: We reviewed patients with DTC under 18 years old (pediatric DTC 
patients) seen during recent 16 years. The clinicopathological features and 
outcomes of pediatric DTC were analyzed by comparison with patients of 19-20 
years old or 21-44 years old.
RESULTS: Sixty four children with DTC [median age 16 years (range, 5-18)] were 
studied. The ratio of female to male was 5:1, but no difference was found by 
comparison with adult of 21-44 years old. No difference was found in 
multifocality, but DTC in child showed lager tumor size (P < 0.001), higher rate 
of extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.017), more local or pulmonary metastasis 
(P < 0.001, P < 0.001 respectively) than adult thyroid carcinoma. High rate of 
Hashimoto's thyroiditis (19/43) without influence on pathological features was 
found in patients under 18 years old. No differences, except for distant 
metastasis, were found by comparison of clinicopathological features between 
patients under 18 years old and 19-20 years old. Pediatric patients possessed 
highest rates of persistent/recurrent disease, though only one child died.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric DTC has more aggressive behavior characterized by a high 
rate of extrathyroidal extension, local and pulmonary metastasis. Pediatric DTC 
has low mortality, but active treatments are needed for the high risk of 
persistent or recurrent diseases. Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be associated with 
the pathogenesis or mechanism of pediatric DTC.

OBJECTIVES: Cervical cytology screening has been successful in reducing deaths 
from cervical cancer. We sought to determine risk factors for abnormal Pap test 
results in women undergoing kidney transplant evaluation.
MATERILAS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined women undergoing kidney 
transplant evaluations from 2008 to 2011. Patients were stratified based on 
normal cytology and atypical/malignant cytology.
RESULTS: Of 404 patients, 293 patients (72.5%) had normal cytologic findings, 
whereas 111 (27.5%) had abnormal findings. On univariate logistic regression 
analyses, patients who had chronic kidney disease with an autoimmune cause (odds 
ratio = 2.71 [95% confidence interval, 1.41-5.19]; P = .003), previous renal 
transplants (odds ratio = 2.64 [95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.82], P = .016), 
or age ≤ 50 years (odds ratio = 1.68 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.61], P = 
.022) were more likely to have abnormal findings. Patients with normal and 
abnormal findings had similar rates of dialysis use. On multivariate logistic 
regression, patients who had chronic kidney disease with autoimmune causes (odds 
ratio = 2.48 [95% confidence interval, 1.26-4.88]; P = .008) and who had 
previous renal transplants (odds ratio = 2.67 [95% confidence interval, 
1.20-5.95]; P = .017) were more likely to have abnormal findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous kidney transplant, autoimmune disease, and age ≤ 50 years 
were associated with abnormalities on cervical cancer screening in our female 
group of patients. Patients with these characteristics may benefit more from 
routine cervical cancer screening than other patients evaluated for kidney 
transplant.

Brain injuries in multiple sclerosis (MS) involve immunopathological, structural 
and metabolic defects on myelin sheath, oligodendrocytes (OLs), axons and 
neurons suggesting that different cellular mechanisms ultimately result in the 
formation of MS plaques, demyelination, inflammation and brain damage. 
Bioenergetics, oxygen and ion metabolism dominate the metabolic and biochemical 
pathways that maintain neuronal viability and impulse transmission which 
directly or indirectly point to mitochondrial integrity and adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) availability indicating the involvement of mitochondria in 
the pathogenesis of MS. Loss of myelin proteins including myelin basic protein 
(MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), myelin 
oligodendrocyte glycoproetin (MOG), 2, 3,-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiestarase 
(CNPase); microglia and microphage activation, oligodendrocyte apoptosis as well 
as expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) and myeloperoxidase 
activities have been implicated in a subset of Balo's type and relapsing 
remitting MS (RRMS) lesions indicating the involvement of metabolic defects and 
oxidative stress in MS. Here, we provide an insighting review of defects in 
cellular metabolism including energy, oxygen and metal metabolism in MS as well 
as the relevance of animal models of MS in understanding the molecular, 
biochemical and cellular mechanisms of MS pathogenesis. Additionally, we also 
discussed the potential for mitochondrial targets and antioxidant protection for 
therapeutic benefits in MS.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue occurs in 75%-95% of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 
is frequently reported as the most disabling symptom. A multicomponent group 
program of six weekly 2-hour sessions, Fatigue: Take Control (FTC), was 
developed from an international MS fatigue management guideline.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether FTC is associated with greater improvements in 
fatigue than MS: Take Control (MSTC), a similarly structured general MS 
education program.
METHODS: This four-site, parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled trial 
compared FTC and MSTC in 204 ambulatory participants with MS. The primary 
outcome, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and secondary outcomes of 
self-efficacy, physical activity, sleep, and medications were assessed at 
baseline, program completion, and 3 and 6 months later.
RESULTS: Mean MFIS scores improved in both groups between baseline and program 
completion (FTC -4.4, p < 0.001; MSTC -3.8, p < 0.001), between baseline and 3 
months after program completion (FTC -3.2, p = 0.01; MSTC -3.3, p = 0.01), and 
between baseline and 6 months after program completion (FTC -5.2, p < 0.001; 
MSTC -4.8, p < 0.001). These improvements were not statistically different 
between groups ( p = 0.64, 0.92, and 0.82, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Participation in FTC modestly improved self-reported fatigue for up 
to 6 months. This improvement did not differ significantly from that occurring 
with the control program.

BACKGROUND: Impaired olfactory threshold has been reported in early inflammatory 
phases of MS, while impaired odor identification was associated with more 
widespread disability.
OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the development of olfactory function and its 
correlation with relapse and disability progression.
METHODS: In this prospective, 3-year longitudinal study on 151 MS patients and 
30 healthy controls, three different qualities of olfactory function (threshold, 
discrimination, and identification) were quantified using the Sniffin' Sticks 
test. The influence of relapses and disability on olfactory function was 
analyzed at different time points and in a multivariate model.
RESULTS: Discrimination and identification capability significantly worsened 
over 3 years, while threshold did not. Threshold was markedly impaired in 
patients with relapse activity within 12 months, recovered in the absence of 
relapse, and was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of relapse. 
Deterioration of discrimination and identification was irreversible and both 
strongly associated with and predictive of EDSS progression.
CONCLUSION: Olfactory function changes over time in MS. Threshold impairment is 
transient and predicts inflammatory disease activity, while odor identification 
and discrimination are associated with disability progression. Olfactory 
dysfunction might be a useful and easily obtainable parameter to monitor 
patients with regard to inflammation and neurodegeneration in MS.

Bleeding heterogeneity amongst patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is 
poorly understood. Platelets play a role in maintaining endothelial integrity, 
and variable thrombocytopenia-induced endothelial changes may influence bleeding 
severity. Platelet-derived endothelial stabilizers and markers of endothelial 
integrity in ITP are largely underexplored. We hypothesized that, in a canine 
ITP model, thrombocytopenia would lead to alterations in the endothelial 
ultrastructure and that the Von Willebrand factor (vWF) would serve as a marker 
of endothelial injury associated with thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was 
induced in healthy dogs with an antiplatelet antibody infusion; control dogs 
received an isotype control antibody. Cutaneous biopsies were obtained prior to 
thrombocytopenia induction, at platelet nadir, 24 hours after nadir, and on 
platelet recovery. Cutaneous capillaries were assessed by electron microscopy 
for vessel thickness, the number of pinocytotic vesicles, the number of large 
vacuoles, and the number of gaps between cells. Pinocytotic vesicles are thought 
to represent an endothelial membrane reserve that can be used for repair of 
damaged endothelial cells. Plasma samples were assessed for vWF. ITP dogs had 
significantly decreased pinocytotic vesicle numbers compared to control dogs 
(P = 0.0357) and the increase in plasma vWF from baseline to 24 hours correlated 
directly with the endothelial large vacuole score (R = 0.99103; P < 0.0001). 
This direct correlation between plasma vWF and the number of large vacuoles, 
representing the vesiculo-vacuolar organelle (VVO), a permeability structure, 
suggests that circulating vWF could serve as a biomarker for endothelial 
alterations and potentially a predictor of thrombocytopenic bleeding. Overall, 
our results indicate that endothelial damage occurs in the canine ITP model and 
variability in the degree of endothelial damage may account for differences in 
the bleeding phenotype among patients with ITP.

OBJECTIVES: To map the regional patterns of white matter (WM) microstructural 
abnormalities and gray matter (GM) atrophy exclusively associated with reduced 
performance in the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Paced Auditory Serial 
Addition Test (PASAT) in relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS) 
patients.
METHODS: In all, 177 RRMS patients and 80 healthy controls (HC) were studied. WM 
microstructural abnormalities were investigated on diffusion tensor images using 
tract-based spatial statistics analysis, and regional GM atrophy was estimated 
on three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted images using voxel-based morphometry.
RESULTS: Compared to HC, RRMS patients showed the expected pattern of 
cortical-subcortical GM atrophy and WM microstructural abnormalities. In 
patients, diffusivity abnormalities of supratentorial WM tracts correlated with 
both SDMT and PASAT scores. Lower SDMT performance was also associated with WM 
damage in several infratentorial WM tracts. Lower SDMT scores correlated with 
atrophy of the right anterior cingulate cortex, left postcentral gyrus, and 
right middle temporal gyrus, whereas lower PASAT scores correlated with atrophy 
of the deep GM nuclei, bilaterally, and several fronto-temporo-occipital 
regions.
CONCLUSION: In RRMS patients, regional damage of different neural systems helps 
explaining reduced performance in SDMT and PASAT. WM microstructural damage 
typified reduced SDMT performance, whereas atrophy of several GM regions 
distinguished reduced PASAT performance.

BACKGROUND: Among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), fatigue is the most 
commonly reported symptom. It can be subdivided into an effort-dependent 
(fatigability) and an effort-independent component (trait-fatigue).
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to disentangle activity changes associated with 
effort-independent "trait-fatigue" from those associated with effort-dependent 
fatigability in MS patients.
METHODS: This study employed behavioral measures and functional magnetic imaging 
to investigate neural changes in MS patients associated with fatigue. A total of 
40 MS patients and 22 age-matched healthy controls performed in a 
fatigue-inducing N-back task. Effort-independent fatigue was assessed using the 
Fatigue Scale of Motor and Cognition (FSMC) questionnaire.
RESULTS: Effort-independent fatigue was observed to be reflected by activity 
increases in fronto-striatal-subcortical networks primarily involved in the 
maintenance of homeostatic processes and in motor and cognitive control. 
Effort-dependent fatigue (fatigability) leads to activity decreases in 
attention-related cortical and subcortical networks.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that effort-independent (fatigue) and 
effort-dependent fatigue (fatigability) in MS patients have functionally related 
but fundamentally different neural correlates. Fatigue in MS as a general 
phenomenon is reflected by complex interactions of activity increases in control 
networks (effort-independent component) and activity reductions in executive 
networks (effort-dependent component) of brain areas.

This review focuses on the complementary roles of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in leukocyte 
migration into the brain in neuroinflammation, studied mainly in a murine model 
of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that has similarity to the 
human disease multiple sclerosis. We discuss the cellular sources of MMP-2/MMP-9 
in EAE, their sites of activity, and how cleavage of the to-date identified 
MMP-2/MMP-9 substrates at the blood-brain barrier facilitate leukocyte 
filtration of the central nervous system (CNS). Where necessary, comparisons are 
made to inflammatory processes in the periphery and to other MMPs relevant to 
neuroinflammation. While the general principles concerning MMP-2 and MMP-9 
function discussed here are relevant to all inflammatory situations, the details 
regarding substrates and molecular mechanisms of action are likely to be 
specific for neuroinflammation.

It is estimated that more than two billion people around the world have been 
infected by Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Reactivation of HBV (rHBV) is a potentially 
fatal complication after biological therapy. With the increasing use of 
biologics and targeted therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who are 
refractory to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, 
rHBV in those with past infection has become increasingly problematic, 
especially in HBV-endemic regions. Among those receiving biological therapy, the 
risk of rHBV varies according to the status of HBV infection and the degree of 
biologic-related immunosuppression. As rHBV is largely preventable, it is 
imperative that the risk status of rHBV in RA patients receiving biological and 
targeted therapy be stratified. Therefore, the aim of this review was to 
summarize the reported data on rHBV, and propose management strategies for RA 
patients with different risks of rHBV based on evidence presented in the current 
literature.

BACKGROUND: Baseline brain volume (BV) is predictive at a group level but is 
difficult to interpret at the single patient level.
OBJECTIVE: To validate BV cutoffs able to identify clinically relevant atrophy 
in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients.
METHODS: The expected normalized brain volume (NBV) for each patient was 
calculated using RRMS patients from two phase III clinical trials, applying a 
linear formula developed on the baseline variable of an independent data set. 
The difference between these expected NBV values and those actually observed was 
calculated and used to categorize the patients in the low-NBV, medium-NBV, and 
high-NBV groups.
RESULTS: The 2-year probability of 3-month confirmed disability worsening was 
significantly associated with the NBV categorization ( p = 0.006), after 
adjusting for treatment effect. Taking the high-NBV group as a reference, the 
hazard ratios for the medium-NBV and low-NBV groups were 1.22 (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.85-1.76, p = 0.27) and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.11-2.57, p = 0.01), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of BV cutoffs to identify clinically 
relevant atrophy in RRMS study by showing that the three groups classified 
according to the baseline NBV adjusted for the other prognostic variables have a 
significant prognostic impact on the risk of disability progression.

BACKGROUND: In multiple sclerosis (MS), various aspects of cognitive function 
can be detrimentally affected, thus patients' employment and social functioning 
is commonly impacted.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse income among MS patients in relation to cognitive 
function, assessed with the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 2080 MS patients was conducted 
linking national register-based data. Descriptive statistics and a two-part 
model were used to estimate differences in earnings and social benefits.
RESULTS: MS patients in the highest SDMT score quartile earned more than twice 
annually compared to patients in the lowest quartile, whereas patients in the 
lowest quartile received three times more income through social benefits. The 
difference in earnings and benefits across the SDMT performance quartiles 
remained statistically significant after adjusting for various clinical and 
socio-demographic variables, including physical disability. The corrected 
prevalence ratios for MS patients in the highest quartile for having income from 
earnings and benefits were 1.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-1.49) and 
0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.90), respectively, when compared to the patients in the 
lowest quartile.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive function affects the financial situation of MS patients 
negatively and independently of physical disability. This warrants cognitive 
testing as a routine measure in health care services for MS patients.

BACKGROUND: B cells may be involved in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis 
(MS). Inebilizumab (formerly MEDI-551) binds to and depletes CD19+ B cells.
OBJECTIVES: To assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
and immunogenicity of inebilizumab in adults with relapsing MS.
METHODS: This phase 1 trial randomised 28 patients 3:1 (21, inebilizumab; 7, 
placebo) to inebilizumab (2 intravenous (IV) doses, days 1 and 15: 30, 100 or 
600 mg; or single subcutaneous (SC) dose on day 1: 60 or 300 mg) or matching 
placebo, with follow-up until at least week 24 or return of CD19+ B-cell count 
to ⩾80 cells/µL.
RESULTS: Complete B-cell depletion was observed across all doses. 
Infusion/injection (grade 1/2) reactions occurred in 6/15 patients receiving 
inebilizumab IV, 2/5 placebo IV and 1/6 inebilizumab SC. Serious adverse events 
occurred in three patients receiving inebilizumab: pyrexia, mixed-drug 
intoxication (unrelated to inebilizumab; resulted in death) and urinary tract 
infection. Mean number of cumulative new gadolinium-enhancing lesions over 
24 weeks was 0.1 with inebilizumab versus 1.3 with placebo; mean numbers of 
new/newly enlarging T2 lesions were 0.4 and 2.4, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Inebilizumab had an acceptable safety profile in relapsing MS 
patients and showed a trend in reductions in new/newly enlarging and 
gadolinium-enhancing lesions.

Autoimmune diseases are characterized by highly specific immune responses 
against molecules in self-tissues. Different autoimmune diseases are 
characterized by distinct immune responses, making autoantibodies useful for 
diagnosis and prediction. In many diseases, the targets of autoantibodies are 
incompletely defined. Although the technologies for autoantibody discovery have 
advanced dramatically over the past decade, each of these techniques generates 
hundreds of possibilities, which are onerous and expensive to validate. We set 
out to establish a method to greatly simplify autoantibody discovery, using a 
pre-filtering step to define subgroups with similar specificities based on 
migration of radiolabeled, immunoprecipitated proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate 
(SDS) gels and autoradiography [Gel Electrophoresis and band detection on 
Autoradiograms (GEA)]. Human recognition of patterns is not optimal when the 
patterns are complex or scattered across many samples. Multiple sources of 
errors-including irrelevant intensity differences and warping of gels-have 
challenged automation of pattern discovery from autoradiograms.In this article, 
we address these limitations using a Bayesian hierarchical model with shrinkage 
priors for pattern alignment and spatial dewarping. The Bayesian model combines 
information from multiple gel sets and corrects spatial warping for coherent 
estimation of autoantibody signatures defined by presence or absence of a grid 
of landmark proteins. We show the pre-processing creates more clearly separated 
clusters and improves the accuracy of autoantibody subset detection via 
hierarchical clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed 
methods with GEA data from scleroderma patients.

BACKGROUND: Exercise therapy studies in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) 
primarily focused on motor outcomes in mid disease stage, while cognitive 
function and neural correlates were only limitedly addressed.
OBJECTIVES: This pragmatic randomized controlled study investigated the effects 
of a remotely supervised community-located "start-to-run" program on physical 
and cognitive function, fatigue, quality of life, brain volume, and 
connectivity.
METHOD: In all, 42 pwMS were randomized to either experimental (EXP) or waiting 
list control (WLC) group. The EXP group received individualized training 
instructions during 12 weeks (3×/week), to be performed in their community 
aiming to participate in a running event. Measures were physical (VO2max, 
sit-to-stand test, Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Multiple Sclerosis Walking 
Scale-12 (MSWS-12)) and cognitive function (Rao's Brief Repeatable Battery 
(BRB), Paced Auditory Serial Attention Test (PASAT)), fatigue (Fatigue Scale for 
Motor and Cognitive Function (FSMC)), quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact 
Scale-29 (MSIS-29)), and imaging. Brain volumes and diffusion tensor imaging 
(DTI) were quantified using FSL-SIENA/FIRST and FSL-TBSS.
RESULTS: In all, 35 pwMS completed the trial. Interaction effects in favor of 
the EXP group were found for VO2max, sit-to-stand test, MSWS-12, Spatial Recall 
Test, FSMC, MSIS-29, and pallidum volume. VO2max improved by 1.5 mL/kg/min, 
MSWS-12 by 4, FSMC by 11, and MSIS-29 by 14 points. The Spatial Recall Test 
improved by more than 10%.
CONCLUSION: Community-located run training improved aerobic capacity, functional 
mobility, visuospatial memory, fatigue, and quality of life and pallidum volume 
in pwMS.

BACKGROUND: The strongest genetic determinant for multiple sclerosis (MS) is 
located at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II DRB1 and DQB1 loci.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possible role of predisposing HLA genotypes in 
determining brain atrophy.
METHODS: HLA genotypes were categorized as high risk (two predisposing 
haplotypes) or medium/low risk (one or no predisposing haplotypes). Patients 
underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study and volumes of white 
matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and whole brain (WB) were estimated with SIENAX. 
Longitudinal atrophy was also assessed with SIENA.
RESULTS: The study included 240 MS patients. In 51/240 (21%) subjects, a 
high-risk HLA genotype was observed, while medium- and low-risk HLA genotypes 
were 109/240 (45%) and 80/240 (34%), respectively. Multiple regression analysis 
found that the high-risk HLA genotype was associated with significant reduction 
in WB ( p = 0.02) and GM ( p = 0.03) volumes compared with the medium-/low-risk 
HLA genotypes, independently from MS clinical features. The longitudinal study 
included 60 patients and showed a brain volume loss of -0.79% in high-risk HLA 
genotype group versus -0.56% in low-risk HLA genotype.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an influence of HLA genotype on WB and GM 
atrophy. Further investigations are necessary to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Limited prospective information exists regarding spectral-domain 
optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in secondary progressive multiple 
sclerosis (SPMS).
OBJECTIVE: Document cross-sectional and longitudinal retinal nerve fiber layer 
(RNFL) and macular ganglion cell plus inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) features of 
an SPMS clinical trial cohort.
METHODS: Prospective, observational study using a 2-year randomized 
placebo-controlled SPMS trial cohort with yearly SD-OCT testing. Post hoc 
analysis determined influences of optic neuritis (ON), disease duration, and 
baseline SD-OCT on annualized atrophy rates and on correlations between OCT and 
brain atrophy.
RESULTS: Mean RNFL and GCIPL values of patients ( n = 47, mean age = 59 years, 
mean disease duration = 30 years) were significantly lower among eyes with prior 
ON than those without (no history of ON (NON)). Annualized RNFL (-0.31 µm/year) 
and GCIPL (-0.29 µm/year) atrophy rates did not differ between ON and NON eyes. 
Baseline RNFL thickness >75 µm was associated with greater annualized RNFL 
atrophy (-0.85 µm/year). Neither RNFL nor GCIPL atrophy correlated with 
whole-brain atrophy.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that eyes with and without ON history may be 
pooled for atrophy analysis in SPMS clinical trials using SD-OCT. Low baseline 
RNFL, small retinal atrophy rates, and lack of correlation with whole-brain 
atrophy in this population are important trial design considerations.

OBJECTIVES: This study adopted a qualitative research design with directed 
content analysis and examined the interpretations of physical activity, 
exercise, and sedentary behaviour by persons with multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: Fifty three persons with multiple sclerosis who were enrolled in an 
exercise trial took part in semi-structured interviews regarding personal 
interpretations of physical activity, exercise, and sedentary behaviours.
RESULTS: Forty three percent of participants indicated a consistent 
understanding of physical activity, 42% of participants indicated a consistent 
understanding of exercise, and 83% of participants indicated a consistent 
understanding of sedentary behaviour with the standard definitions. There was 
evidence of definitional ambiguity (i.e., 57, 58, and 11% of the sample for 
physical activity, exercise, and sedentary behaviour, respectively); 6% of the 
sample inconsistently defined sedentary behaviour with standard definitions. 
Some participants described physical activity in a manner that more closely 
aligned with exercise and confused sedentary behaviour with exercise or 
sleeping/napping.
CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the need to provide and utilise consistent 
definitions for accurate understanding, proper evaluation and communication of 
physical activity, exercise, and sedentary behaviours among persons with 
multiple sclerosis.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The application of consistent definitions may minimise 
ambiguity, alleviate the equivocality of findings in the literature, and 
translate into improved communication about these behaviours in multiple 
sclerosis. Implications for Rehabilitation The symptoms of multiple sclerosis 
can be managed through participation in physical activity and exercise. Persons 
with multiple sclerosis are not engaging in sufficient levels of physical 
activity and exercise for health benefits. Rehabilitation professionals should 
use established definitions of physical activity, exercise, and sedentary 
behaviours when communicating about these behaviours among persons with multiple 
sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and its active metabolite monomethyl 
fumarate (MMF) effectively lead to reduction in disease relapses and active 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions. DMF and MMF are known to be effective 
in modulating T- and B-cell responses; however, their effect on the phenotype 
and function of human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of MMF on human mDCs maturation and function.
METHODS: mDCs from healthy controls were isolated and cultured in vitro with 
MMF. The effect of MMF on mDC gene expression was determined by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) array after in vitro MMF treatment. The ability of mDCs to 
activate T cells was assessed by in vitro co-culture system. mDCs from 
DMF-treated multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and 
PCR.
RESULTS: MMF treatment induced a less mature phenotype of mDCs with reduced 
expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), co-stimulatory 
molecules CD86, CD40, CD83, and expression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) subunits 
RELA and RELB. mDCs from DMF-treated MS patients also showed the same immature 
phenotype. T cells co-cultured with MMF-treated mDCs showed reduced 
proliferation with decreased production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), 
interleukin-17 (IL-17), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF) compared to untreated cells.
CONCLUSION: We report that MMF can modulate immune response by affecting human 
mDC function.

BACKGROUND: Peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thickness is 
emerging as a marker of axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS).
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively assess the predictive value of pRNFL for 
progression of physical and cognitive disability in relapsing-remitting MS 
(RRMS).
METHODS: In this 3-year longitudinal study on 151 RRMS patients, pRNFL was 
measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). We used 
proportional hazard models, correcting for age, sex, disease duration, Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at 
baseline, to test a pRNFL thickness ≤88 µm at baseline for prediction of EDSS 
progression and cognitive decline. We also evaluated the decrease in pRNFL 
thickness from baseline to year 3 in a multivariate linear regression model.
RESULTS: pRNFL thickness ≤88 µm was independently associated with a threefold 
increased risk of EDSS progression ( p < 0.001) and a 2.7-fold increased risk of 
cognitive decline within the subsequent 3 years ( p < 0.001). Mean pRNFL delta 
was -5.3 µm (SD, 4.2). It was significantly negatively impacted by EDSS 
progression, cognitive decline, higher age and disease duration, while 
positively impacted by disease-modifying therapy (DMT).
CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional and longitudinal monitoring of pRNFL is useful as a 
biomarker for prediction of physical and cognitive disability progression in 
patients with RRMS in everyday clinical practice.

A , Diepenbeek , Belgium.

PURPOSE: High-intensity concurrent training positively affects cardiovascular 
risk factors. Because this was never investigated in multiple sclerosis, the 
present pilot study explored the impact of this training on cardiovascular risk 
factors in this population.
METHODS: Before and after 12 weeks of high-intense concurrent training (interval 
and strength training, 5 sessions per 2 weeks, n = 16) body composition, resting 
blood pressure and heart rate, 2-h oral glucose tolerance (insulin sensitivity, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, blood glucose and insulin concentrations), blood lipids 
(high- and low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglyceride levels) and 
C-reactive protein were analyzed.
RESULTS: Twelve weeks of high-intense concurrent training significantly improved 
resting heart rate (-6%), 2-h blood glucose concentrations (-13%) and insulin 
sensitivity (-24%). Blood pressure, body composition, blood lipids and 
C-reactive protein did not seem to be affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this pilot study, 12 weeks of concurrent 
high-intense interval and strength training improved resting heart rate, 2-h 
glucose and insulin sensitivity in multiple sclerosis but did not affect blood 
C-reactive protein levels, blood pressure, body composition and blood lipid 
profiles. Further, larger and controlled research investigating the effects of 
high-intense concurrent training on cardiovascular risk factors in multiple 
sclerosis is warranted. Implications for rehabilitation High-intensity 
concurrent training improves cardiovascular fitness. This pilot study explores 
the impact of this training on cardiovascular risk factors in multiple 
sclerosis. Despite the lack of a control group, high-intense concurrent training 
does not seem to improve cardiovascular risk factors in multiple sclerosis.

Comparison of seating, powered characteristics and functions and costs of 
electrically powered wheelchairs in a general population of users.

Author information:

Astley Ainslie Hospital , Edinburgh , UK.

PURPOSE: To profile and compare the seating and powered characteristics and 
functions of electrically powered wheelchairs (EPWs) in a general user 
population including equipment costs.
METHOD: Case notes of adult EPW users of a regional NHS service were reviewed 
retrospectively. Seating equipment complexity and type were categorized using 
the Edinburgh classification. Powered characteristics and functions, including 
control device type, were recorded.
RESULTS: 482 cases were included; 53.9% female; mean duration EPW use 8.1 years 
(SD 7.4); rear wheel drive 88.0%; hand joystick 94.8%. Seating complexity: low 
73.2%, medium 18.0%, high 8.7%. Most prevalent diagnoses: multiple sclerosis 
(MS) 25.3%, cerebral palsy (CP) 18.7%, muscular dystrophy (8.5%). Compared to CP 
users, MS users were significantly older at first use, less experienced, more 
likely to have mid-wheel drive and less complex seating. Additional costs for 
muscular dystrophy and spinal cord injury users were 3-4 times stroke users.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large study of a general EPW user population 
using a seating classification. Significant differences were found between 
diagnostic groups; nevertheless, there was also high diversity within each 
group. The differences in provision and the equipment costs across diagnostic 
groups can be used to improve service planning. Implications for Rehabilitation 
At a service planning level, knowledge of a population's diagnostic group and 
age distribution can be used to inform decisions about the number of required 
EPWs and equipment costs. At a user level, purchasing decisions about powered 
characteristics and functions of EPWs and specialised seating equipment need to 
be taken on a case by case basis because of the diversity of users' needs within 
diagnostic groups. The additional equipment costs for SCI and MD users are 
several times those of stroke users and add between 60 and 70% of the cost of 
basic provision.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to (1) explore and (2) compare 
circumstances of falls among full-time wheelchair users with spinal cord injury 
(SCI) and multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: A mixed method approach was used to explore and compare the 
circumstances of falls of 41 full-time wheelchair users with SCI (n = 23) and MS 
(n = 18). In addition to collecting participants' demographic information (age, 
gender, type of wheelchair used, duration of wheelchair use, and duration of 
disability), self-reported fall frequency in the past 6 months, self-reported 
restriction in activity due to fear of falling and the Spinal Cord Injury-Fall 
Concerns Scale (SCI-FCS) was collected. Qualitative data in the form of 
participants' responses to an open-ended question yielding information regarding 
the circumstances of the most recent fall were also collected. To examine 
differences in survey outcomes and demographic characteristics between 
participants with SCI and MS, independent t-tests and Pearson's Chi-square tests 
were used. Qualitative data were analyzed with a thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that individuals with MS (mean =3.3) had 
significantly higher average SCI-FCS than individuals with SCI (mean =2.4). The 
analysis of the participants' descriptions of the circumstances of their most 
recent falls resulted in three main categories: action-related fall contributors 
(e.g., transfer), (2) location of falls (e.g., bathroom), and (3) fall 
attributions (e.g., surface condition).
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study helped to understand fall circumstances 
among full-time wheelchair users with MS and SCI. Findings from this study can 
inform the development of evidenced-based interventions to improve the 
effectiveness of clinically based treatment protocols. Implications for 
rehabilitation Falls are a common health concern in full-time wheelchair users 
living with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The circumstances 
surrounding falls reported by full-time wheelchair users living with multiple 
sclerosis and spinal cord injuries were found to be multifactorial. The complex 
nature of falls must be taken into consideration in the development of fall 
prevention programs. Findings from this study can inform the development of 
comprehensive evidence-based, population-specific interventions to manage falls 
among full-time wheelchair users living with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord 
injury.

PURPOSE: To cross-culturally translate the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale 
into Italian and to evaluate its psychometric properties in patients with 
multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: The Italian version of Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale was 
developed in accordance with international standards and subsequently 
administered to 232 Italian adults with multiple sclerosis. The following 
psychometric properties were analyzed: internal consistency through Cronbach's α 
and item-to-total correlation, dimensionality with factor analysis, and 
convergent and criterion validity through hypotheses-testing, comparing the 
Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale with other outcome measures (Fatigue 
Severity Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life, Modified Ashworth Scale, 
Barthel Index, and Expanded Disability Status Scale) and analyzing related 
constructs. Finally, we correlated the MSSS-88 subscales with each other.
RESULTS: The final Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale version was 
well-understood by all subjects. The internal consistency was good (Cronbach's α 
≥0.90). Factor analysis revealed that each subscale was unidimensional. 
Convergent and criterion validity were supported by acceptable correlations with 
other disease-specific questionnaires, according to the a priori expectations.
CONCLUSIONS: The final Italian Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale version 
showed robust psychometric properties. Therefore, it can be recommended as an 
assessment tool for clinical and research use to evaluate spasticity in Italian 
patients with multiple sclerosis. Implications for rehabilitation The Multiple 
Sclerosis Spasticity Scale was developed to measure patients' perception of the 
impact of spasticity on life of subjects with multiple sclerosis. In a sample of 
Italian subjects with multiple sclerosis, the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity 
Scale revealed good internal consistency and convergent and criterion validity. 
Factor analysis demonstrated that each subscale was unidimensional. Each 
subscale can be used to assess the impact of spasticity in Italian patients with 
multiple sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Increase of brain total sodium concentrations (TSC) is present in 
multiple sclerosis (MS), but its pathological involvement has not been assessed 
yet.
OBJECTIVE: To determine in vivo the metabolic counterpart of brain sodium 
accumulation.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Whole brain 23Na-MR imaging and 3D-1H-EPSI data were 
collected in 21 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and 20 
volunteers. Metabolites and sodium levels were extracted from several regions of 
grey matter (GM), normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and white matter (WM) T2 
lesions. Metabolic and ionic levels expressed as Z-scores have been averaged 
over the different compartments and used to explain sodium accumulations through 
stepwise regression models.
RESULTS: MS patients showed significant 23Na accumulations with lower choline 
and glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels in GM; 23Na accumulations with lower 
N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), Glx levels and higher Myo-Inositol (m-Ins) in NAWM; 
and higher 23Na, m-Ins levels with lower NAA in WM T2 lesions. Regression models 
showed associations of TSC increase with reduced NAA in GM, NAWM and T2 lesions, 
as well as higher total-creatine, and smaller decrease of m-Ins in T2 lesions. 
GM Glx levels were associated with clinical scores.
CONCLUSION: Increase of TSC in RRMS is mainly related to neuronal mitochondrial 
dysfunction while dysfunction of neuro-glial interactions within GM is linked to 
clinical scores.

BACKGROUND: The hygiene hypothesis suggests that microbial replacement may be 
therapeutic in allergic and autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, the results of 
helminth treatment, including in multiple sclerosis (MS), have been 
inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: To assess safety and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity 
in subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) during oral 
administration of ova from the porcine whipworm, Trichuris suis (TSO).
METHODS: A total of 16 disease-modifying treatment (DMT) naive RRMS subjects 
were studied in a baseline versus treatment (BVT) controlled prospective study. 
MRI scans were performed during 5 months of screening-observation, 10 months of 
treatment, and 4 months of post-treatment surveillance.
RESULTS: No serious symptoms or adverse events occurred during treatment. For 
the cohort, there was a trend consistent with a 35% diminution in active lesions 
when observation MRIs were compared to treatment MRIs ( p = 0.08), and at the 
level of individuals, 12 of 16 subjects improved during TSO treatment. T 
regulatory lymphocytes were increased during TSO treatment.
CONCLUSION: TSO is safe in RRMS subjects. Potentially favorable MRI outcomes and 
immunoregulatory changes were observed during TSO treatment; however, the 
magnitude of these effects was modest, and there was considerable variation 
among the responses of individual subjects.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study investigated the clinical and pathological features 
of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related ophthalmic disease. To clarify the features, 
we compared IgG4-related ophthalmic disease and orbital inflammatory 
pseudotumor.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 103 patients who 
were initially diagnosed with orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, and identified 
16 cases in which the diagnosis was based on surgical biopsy and for which data 
in medical records were sufficient for analysis. Immunohistochemical staining of 
pathological specimens for IgG and IgG4 was performed. Finally, six of 
IgG4-related ophthalmic disease patient and 10 of orbital inf lammatory 
pseudotumor patient were analyzed.
RESULTS: The IgG4-related ophthalmic disease group had more IgG4-positive plasma 
cells and a higher IgG4/IgG plasma cell ratio than the orbital inflammatory 
pseudotumor group. Collagenous fibrosis and lacrimal gland involvement were 
significantly more frequent in the IgG4-related ophthalmic disease group. Dense 
lymphocyte infiltration, obliterative phlebitis, and bilateral lesions were more 
frequent in IgG4-related ophthalmic disease, but the differences were not 
significant. The recurrence-free period was shorter in the IgG4-related 
ophthalmic disease group (p = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: The location of the lesion (lacrimal gland), count and ratio of 
IgG4-positive plasma cells, and collagenous fibrosis aid the diagnosis of 
IgG4-related ophthalmic disease in patients with idiopathic orbital mass-like 
lesions. In addition, maintenance therapy should be considered in patients with 
IgG4-related ophthalmic disease to prevent recurrence.

Members of the interleukin (IL)-10 family of cytokines play important roles in 
regulating immune responses during host defense but also in autoimmune 
disorders, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. Although IL-10 itself primarily 
acts on leukocytes and has potent immunosuppressive functions, other family 
members preferentially target nonimmune compartments, such as tissue epithelial 
cells, where they elicit innate defense mechanisms to control viral, bacterial, 
and fungal infections, protect tissue integrity, and promote tissue repair and 
regeneration. As cytokines are prime drug targets, IL-10 family cytokines 
provide great opportunities for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, tissue 
damage, and cancer. Yet no therapy in this space has been approved to date. 
Here, we summarize the diverse biology of the IL-10 family as it relates to 
human disease and review past and current strategies and challenges to target 
IL-10 family cytokines for clinical use.

As key regulators of both innate and adaptive immunity, it is unsurprising that 
the activity of interleukin (IL)-1 cytokine family members is tightly controlled 
by decoy receptors, antagonists, and a variety of other mechanisms. 
Additionally, inflammasome-mediated proteolytic maturation is a prominent and 
distinguishing feature of two important members of this cytokine family, IL-1β 
and IL-18, because their full-length gene products are biologically inert. 
Although vital in antimicrobial host defense, deregulated inflammasome signaling 
is linked with a growing number of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. 
Here, we focus on introducing the diverse inflammasome types and discussing 
their causal roles in periodic fever syndromes. Therapies targeting IL-1 or 
IL-18 show great efficacy in some of these autoinflammatory diseases, although 
further understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to unregulated 
production of these key cytokines is required to benefit more patients.

Radiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.

BACKGROUND: Vascular risk factors (VRF) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have 
been associated with lower brain volumes. It is currently unknown if this 
association already exists in early MS and how it develops over time.
METHODS: We identified 82 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) ( n = 
61) or with early relapsing-remitting MS ( n = 21) and assessed their VRF 
including arterial hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking. 
We analysed T2-lesion load, normalized brain volume (NBV), cortical grey (cGMV) 
and white matter volumes (WMV), thalamic and basal ganglia volumes at baseline 
and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and assessed the percentage of 
brain volume change (PBVC) using SIENA.
RESULTS: Patient mean age was 32.4 (±8.7) years and 54 (65%) were women. Median 
follow-up period was 42 (29-54) months. In total, 26 patients (31.7%) had one or 
more VRF (VRF+). At baseline, VRF+ patients had a lower NBV (1530.9 cm3 vs 
1591.2 cm3, p = 0.001), a lower cGMV (628.5 cm3 vs 668.6 cm3, p = 0.002) and WMV 
(752.2 cm3 vs 783.9 cm3, p = 0.009) than VRF-negative patients. Similar results 
were obtained at follow-up. PBVC was comparable between patients with and 
without VRF.
CONCLUSION: VRF are associated with lower brain volume already in early MS but 
do not lead to increased brain volume loss during 3.5 years of follow-up.

University , Shijiazhuang , China.

PURPOSE: To describe a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) presenting in 
a hepatitis C patient after interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and ribavirin treatment.
METHODS: A retrospective review of our patient and a review of the published 
literature.
RESULTS: A 59 year-old man developed VKH after the four months of IFN-α and 
ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C. The patient's VKH was controlled by systemic 
corticosteroids. The relationship between VKH and IFN-α is discussed based on 
the published literature.
CONCLUSIONS: VKH is a rare autoimmune complication triggered by interferon-alpha 
therapy; the T-cell modulatory properties of IFN-α possibly contribute to this 
association. Early diagnosis of VKH and aggressive systemic corticosteroid 
intervention are essential for this type of IFN-α -related autoimmune 
complication.

(4)d Centre for Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research, School of 
Physiotherapy , University of Otago , Dunedin , New Zealand.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine coping strategies 
that people with multiple sclerosis use, and to identify factors that influence 
their coping pattern.
METHOD: This systematic review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines 
for synthesizing descriptive quantitative research. The following databases were 
searched from the inception of databases until December 2016: Ovid (Medline, 
Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO), Science Direct, Web of Science, and Scopus. 
Manual search was also conducted from the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Findings related to the patterns of coping with multiple sclerosis and factors 
influencing coping with multiple sclerosis were extracted and synthesized.
RESULTS: The search of the database yielded 455 articles. After excluding 
duplicates (n = 341) and studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria 
(n = 27), 71 studies were included in the full-text review. Following the 
full-text, a further 21 studies were excluded. Quality appraisal of 50 studies 
was completed, and 38 studies were included in the review. Synthesis of findings 
indicated that people with multiple sclerosis use emotional and avoidance coping 
strategies more than other types of coping, particularly in the early stages of 
the disease. In comparison to the general population, people with multiple 
sclerosis were less likely to use active coping strategies and used more 
avoidance and emotional coping strategies. The pattern of coping with multiple 
sclerosis was associated with individual, clinical and psychological factors 
including gender, educational level, clinical course, mood and mental status, 
attitude, personality traits, and religious beliefs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review suggest that considering individual or 
disease-related factors could help healthcare professionals in identifying those 
less likely to adapt to multiple sclerosis. This information could also be used 
to provide client-centered rehabilitation for people living with multiple 
sclerosis based on their individual responses and perceptions for coping. 
Implications for rehabilitation Engagement in coping with multiple sclerosis has 
been associated with individual factors and neuropsychological functions. 
Considering individual and disease-related factors would allow healthcare 
professionals to provide more tailored interventions to maintain and master 
coping with multiple sclerosis. People living with multiple sclerosis should be 
empowered to appraise and manage ability to cope based on the contextual 
evidence (individual and clinical condition). Rehabilitation services should 
move beyond physical management incorporating behavioral aspects for better 
functioning in living with multiple sclerosis.

PURPOSE: To report the pattern of posterior and panuveitis at a tertiary 
referral center in Singapore.
METHODS: Subgroup retrospective analysis of 334 new posterior and panuveitis 
cases, from the Ocular Autoimmune Systemic Inflammatory Infectious Study (OASIS) 
database. Descriptive analysis was performed and visual outcome and 
complications were reported.
RESULTS: The etiology for posterior uveitis and panuveitis was infectious in 162 
patients (48.5%), non-infectious in 144 patients (43.1%), and idiopathic in 28 
patients (8.4%). More patients with bilateral disease had a non-infectious 
etiology (n = 82, 50.9%) (p = 0.012). The most common complication was 
epiretinal membrane (n = 20, 12.3%) for the infectious group and cystoid macular 
edema (n = 12, 8.3%) for the non-infectious group.
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of etiologies in our cohort varies from other 
studies. Understanding the variations and demographic associations allows the 
diagnosis and management of posterior and panuveitis to be further improved.

OPATs: Omnibus P-value association tests.

Chen CW(1), Yang HC(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica.

Combining statistical significances (P-values) from a set of single-locus 
association tests in genome-wide association studies is a proof-of-principle 
method for identifying disease-associated genomic segments, functional genes and 
biological pathways. We review P-value combinations for genome-wide association 
studies and introduce an integrated analysis tool, Omnibus P-value Association 
Tests (OPATs), which provides popular analysis methods of P-value combinations. 
The software OPATs programmed in R and R graphical user interface features a 
user-friendly interface. In addition to analysis modules for data quality 
control and single-locus association tests, OPATs provides three types of 
set-based association test: window-, gene- and biopathway-based association 
tests. P-value combinations with or without threshold and rank truncation are 
provided. The significance of a set-based association test is evaluated by using 
resampling procedures. Performance of the set-based association tests in OPATs 
has been evaluated by simulation studies and real data analyses. These set-based 
association tests help boost the statistical power, alleviate the 
multiple-testing problem, reduce the impact of genetic heterogeneity, increase 
the replication efficiency of association tests and facilitate the 
interpretation of association signals by streamlining the testing procedures and 
integrating the genetic effects of multiple variants in genomic regions of 
biological relevance. In summary, P-value combinations facilitate the 
identification of marker sets associated with disease susceptibility and uncover 
missing heritability in association studies, thereby establishing a foundation 
for the genetic dissection of complex diseases and traits. OPATs provides an 
easy-to-use and statistically powerful analysis tool for P-value combinations.

PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to analyze the correlations between the 
expression of glucose transporters GLUT-1, GLUT-4, and GLUT-9 in human term 
placenta and selected maternal and fetal parameters in pregnancies complicated 
by diabetes mellitus (DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Placental samples were obtained from healthy control 
(n = 25) and diabetic pregnancies, including diet-controlled gestational 
diabetes mellitus (GDMG1) (n = 16), insulin-controlled gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDMG2) (n = 6), and pregestational DM (PGDM) (n = 6). 
Computer-assisted quantitative morphometry of stained placental sections was 
performed to determine the expression of selected glucose transporter proteins. 
For the purposes of correlation analysis, the following parameters were 
selected: type of diabetes, gestational age, maternal prepregnancy body mass 
index (BMI), gestational weight gain, third trimester glycated hemoglobin 
concentration, placental weight, fetal birth weight (FBW) as well as 
ultrasonographic indicators of fetal adiposity, including subscapular (SSFM), 
abdominal (AFM), and midthigh (MTFM) fat mass measurements.
RESULTS: In the PGDM group, the analysis demonstrated positive correlations 
between the placental expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-4, and GLUT-9 and FBW, AFM, and 
SSFM measurements (p < .05). Similarly in the GDMG2 patients positive 
correlations between GLUT-4 expression, FBW and SSFM were observed (p < .05). In 
the multivariate regression analysis, only the type of diabetes and FBW were 
significantly associated with GLUTs expression (p < .001). In addition, maternal 
prepregnancy BMI significantly contributed to GLUT-1 expression (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study results revealed that placental expression of GLUT-1, 
GLUT-4, and GLUT-9 may be involved in the intensification of the fetal growth in 
pregnancies complicated by GDM/PGDM.

Short- and long-term consequences for offspring exposed to maternal diabetes: a 
review.

Author information:
(1)a Department of Medicine , University of Padua , Padua , Italy.

The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus is increasing, as is the 
worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity, even in children and 
adolescents. Exposure in utero to maternal diabetes carries several short-term 
consequences due mainly to maternal hyperglycemia, and consequent fetal 
hyperinsulinemia. Current evidence also supports the hypothesis that adult 
health and disease have developmental origins, and that disorders in early-life 
environments prompt metabolic imprinting that results in a greater risk of 
negative metabolic outcomes later in life. In particular, exposure in utero to 
maternal diabetes seems to influence long-term metabolic outcomes, carrying a 
higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and thus creating a vicious cycle 
for future generations. In this paper, the short- and long-term consequences of 
exposure in utero to hyperglycemia are reviewed, focusing particularly on the 
long-term metabolic consequences, and investigating the possible pathogenic 
mechanisms involved.

This study aimed to evaluate whether normal serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 
(MMP-3) levels can be used to predict clinical remission and normal physical 
function at a single time point when treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) in daily practice settings. Subjects were all 1321 RA patients who were 
treated at our hospital. The accuracy of serum MMP-3 levels was larger than 
those of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels for predicting clinical remission 
[Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) ≤ 3.3], normal function [Disability 
Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) ≤ 0.5], and both in 
clinical remission and with normal function (clinical remission + normal 
function) using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Serum MMP-3 
levels were significantly correlated with CRP levels [r 0.229 (men), r 0.476 
(women)] using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Among patients with normal 
CRP levels (n = 807), the percentage of patients in clinical remission, with 
normal function, and with clinical remission + normal function having normal 
serum MMP-3 levels was significantly higher than those with abnormal serum MMP-3 
levels. In addition, among patients with the 28-point count Disease Activity 
Score-CRP (DAS28-CRP) remission (DAS28-CRP < 2.3), the percentage of patients in 
clinical remission, with normal function, and with clinical remission + normal 
function having normal serum MMP-3 levels was significantly higher than those 
with abnormal serum MMP-3 levels. Our findings suggest that normal serum MMP-3 
levels, in combination with CRP levels or disease activity, are useful for 
predicting clinical remission and normal physical function in patients with RA.

OBJECTIVE: Study aims were to determine the frequency of highly active disease 
in pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), the response to natalizumab (NTZ) and 
fingolimod (FTY) treatment, and the impact of current treatment modalities on 
the clinical course.
METHODS: Retrospective single-center study in the German Center for MS in 
Childhood and Adolescence.
RESULTS: Of 144 patients with first MS manifestation between 2011 and 2015, 
41.6% fulfilled the criteria for highly active MS. In total, 55 patients treated 
with NTZ and 23 with FTY demonstrated a significant reduction in relapse rate 
(NTZ: 95.2%, FTY: 75%), new T2 lesions (NTZ: 97%, FTY: 81%), and 
contrast-enhancing lesions (NTZ: 97%, FTY: 93%). However, seven patients 
switched from NTZ to FTY experienced an increase in disease activity. Comparing 
pediatric MS patients treated in 2005 with those treated in 2015 showed a 46% 
reduction in relapse rate and a 44% reduction in mean Expanded Disability Status 
Scale (EDSS).
CONCLUSION: The rate of highly active disease among pediatric MS patients is 
high; more than 40% in our cohort. Response to NTZ and FTY treatment is similar 
if not better than observed in adults. Current treatment modalities including 
earlier treatment initiation and the introduction of NTZ and FTY have 
significantly improved the clinical course of pediatric MS.

BACKGROUND: Female adolescents with type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM) have an 
increased risk of developing eating disorders (ED) due to the dietary 
recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate the association between dietary intake and increased risk 
of ED.
METHODS: Case-control study with 50 T1DM female adolescents (11-16 years) and 
100 healthy peers (CG). Measures included food frequency questionnaire (FFQ-PP), 
Child-EDE.12, economic and anthropometric data.
RESULTS: Comparing female adolescents with T1DM vs CG, the first had higher 
intake of: bread, cereal, rice, and pasta (29.7 vs 23.8%, p = 0.001), vegetables 
(6.5 vs 2.8%, p < 0.001), milk yogurt and cheese (9.9 vs 7.6%, p = 0.032), fat, 
and oils (8.2 vs 5.9%, p = 0.003), besides higher fiber intake (19.2 vs 14.7%, 
p = 0.006) and lower consumption of sweets (13.6 vs 30.7%, p < 0.001). No 
differences on ED psychopathology (Child-EDE subscales and global score) were 
found between groups. In unadjusted association between the ED psychopathology 
and dietary intake, a diet rich in fiber was significantly associated with both 
the global and eating concern scores. Among CG, increased intake of meat, 
poultry, fish, and eggs and decreased bread, cereal, rice, and pasta consumption 
were significantly associated with higher ED psychopathology. When BMI and age 
are adjusted, the association between fiber intake and ED psychopathology is no 
longer significant among diabetic participants; however, in the CG, this 
association remains.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that an association between dietary intake and 
ED psychopathology might exist in female adolescents with and without TIDM and 
that careful evaluation of the dietary profile and risk of developing an ED 
should be considered in clinical practice.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control study.

Autoimmune hypophysitis is an immune-related adverse event of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. In this article, we present the case of a 58-year-old female patient 
who presented to the emergency room with gradually worsening nonspecific 
symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting and decreased oral intake of one week 
duration. The patient had been diagnosed with relapsed extensive stage small 
cell lung cancer. She was being treated with a combination of ipilimumab and 
nivolumab after progression on chemotherapy. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic 
resonance imaging of head revealed pituitary enlargement up to 1.5 cm and 
pituitary stalk enlargement up to 4 mm consistent with hypophysitis. The patient 
was treated with corticosteroids resulting in rapid resolution of her symptoms. 
The objective of our report is to highlight this rare but important adverse 
event associated with checkpoint inhibitors, and discuss its clinical features, 
diagnostic work-up and treatment.

This study examined nonverbal intelligence and scholastic achievement in 
children with type 1 diabetes. In a retrospective case-control study, 69 
children (35 males) ages 5-10 years with type 1 diabetes and 69 healthy controls 
matched to patients by age, gender and socioeconomic status were compared 
according to their performance on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and 
their scholastic grades. No differences in nonverbal intelligence and grades 
were observed between children with type 1 diabetes and healthy control 
subjects. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices scores inversely correlated with 
duration of illness both in children with early onset of type 1 diabetes and 
poor metabolic control. Possible explanations of the results and implications 
are discussed.

The association between employment and psychological health in adults with 
multiple sclerosis was examined ( N = 33 studies). Standardised mean differences 
(Hedges' g) between those employed and those not in the workforce were 
calculated. Employed peers reported significantly greater quality of life and 
mood, cited fewer work and multiple sclerosis-related difficulties and were more 
likely to adopt problem-focused coping strategies, considered to be more 
effective in managing specific stressors. These data are consistent with the 
positive by-products of maintaining work with multiple sclerosis. Further 
research is needed to determine the longitudinal course of coping for those who 
remain employed.

The modeling and experimentation of a pneumatic actuation system for the 
development of a soft robotic therapeutic glove is proposed in this article for 
the prevention of finger deformities in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The 
Rehabilitative Arthritis Glove (RA-Glove) is a soft robotic glove fitted with 
two internal inflatable actuators for lateral compression and massage of the 
fingers and their joints. Two mechanical models to predict the indentation and 
bending characteristics of the inflatable actuators based on their geometrical 
parameters will be presented and validated with experimental results. 
Experimental validation shows that the model was within a standard deviation of 
the experimental mean for input pressure range of 0 to 2 bars. Evaluation of the 
RA-Glove was also performed on six healthy human subjects. The stress 
distribution along the fingers of the subjects using the RA-Glove was also shown 
to be even and specific to the finger sizes. This article demonstrates the 
modeling of soft pneumatic actuators and highlights the potential of the 
RA-Glove as a therapeutic device for the prevention of arthritic deformities of 
the fingers.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of tocilizumab 
(TCZ) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a real-world clinical 
setting in Taiwan.
METHOD: All refractory RA patients who initiated intravenous TCZ between August 
2012 and March 2015 were enrolled. Data on patient characteristics, drug safety 
and effectiveness were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 114 RA patients were recruited. Despite the majority of them 
(93%) had previous biologic failure, 43.75% of the patients were able to reach 
ACR50 after one year. Serious adverse events commonly found were bacterial 
pneumonia (4.24/100 patient-years) followed by cellulitis (2.12/100 
patient-years). Twenty-three patients had old or latent TB infections, 11 
patients had chronic hepatitis B. During the 3 years follow-up, none of them had 
reactivation of TB, or hepatitis B with concomitant use of isoniazid prophylaxis 
or pre-emptive antiviral treatment.
CONCLUSION: In this 3-year real-world study on RA patients of Taiwan, we found a 
good long-term effectiveness and similar safety profiles for the TCZ treatment. 
With prophylactic strategy for latent TB and pre-emptive antiviral treatment for 
HBV carriers, the risk of reactivation of latent TB and HBV may be reassured.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a multivariable clinical prediction model for the 
requirement of aggressive immunosuppression with cytostatics, based on simple 
clinical record data and lab tests. The model is defined in accordance with the 
result of the kidney biopsies.
METHODS: Retrospective study conducted with data from patients 16 years and 
older, with SLE and nephritis with less than 6 months of evolution. An initial 
bivariate analysis was conducted to select the variables to be included in a 
multiple logistic regression model. Goodness of fit was evaluated using a 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test (H-L) and the discrimination capacity of the model by means 
of the area under the ROC (AUC) curve.
RESULTS: Data from 242 patients was gathered; of these, 18.2% (n=44) did not 
need an addition of cytostatics according to the findings of their kidney 
biopsies. The variables included in the final model were 24-h proteinuria, 
diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, C3 complement and the interaction of 
hematuria with leukocyturia in urinary sediment. The model showed excellent 
discrimination (AUC=0.929; 95% CI=0.894-0.963) and adequate calibration (H-L, 
P=.959).
CONCLUSION: In recent-onset LN patients, the decision to use or not to use 
intensive immunosuppressive therapy could be performed based on our prediction 
model as an alternative to kidney biopsies.

PURPOSE: To assess structural changes in retina and choroid after systemic 
corticosteroid therapy in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease using swept-source 
optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).
METHODS: SS-OCT was conducted before treatment and during first-month follow-up 
in 16 eyes treated with systemic corticosteroids for active VKH. Retina was 
divided into five zones depending on pretreatment choroidal thickness (CT) of 
<100, >100 to <200, >200 to <300, >300 to <400 and >400μm, and changes in 
retinal thickness and CT after treatment in these zones were compared with 
baseline.
RESULTS: Mean CT significantly improved from 83.1±8.75 to 156.4±62.73μm(p = 
0.008) in the zone with pre-CT <100μm and significantly decreased from 336.1 ± 
17.28 to 266.28 ± 81.39μm(p = 0.008) in the zone with pre-CT > 300μm.
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown choroidal remodeling in VKH. SS-OCT can serve as an 
important noninvasive tool in assessment of treatment response in patients with 
VKH disease.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in clinical practice, establishing the 
optimized regimen and switching from intravenous (IV) to subcutaneous (SC) 
therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study. We included 53 RA 
patients treated with TCZ. The main outcome was TCZ effectiveness at week 24. 
Secondary outcome variables included effectiveness at week 52, therapeutic 
maintenance, physical function and safety. The effectiveness of optimization and 
the switch from IV to SC was evaluated at 3 and 6 months. The efficacy was 
measured with the Disease Activity Score. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon were used 
to evaluate effectiveness and survival time using Kaplan-Meier.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients who achieved remission or low disease 
activity at weeks 24 and 52 was 75.5% and 87.3%, respectively. The mean 
retention time (95% confidence interval [95% CI] was 81.7 months [76.6-86.7]). 
Twenty-one of 53 patients (39.6%) optimized the TCZ dose and 35 patients 
switched from IV TCZ to SC, with no changes in effectiveness. The adverse event 
rate was 13.6 events/100 patient-years.
CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab appears to be effective and safe in RA in clinical 
practice. The optimized regimen appears to be effective in most patients in 
remission, even when they change from IV to SC.

We consider modelling and inference as well as sample size estimation and 
reestimation for clinical trials with longitudinal count data as outcomes. Our 
approach is general but is rooted in design and analysis of multiple sclerosis 
trials where lesion counts obtained by magnetic resonance imaging are important 
endpoints. We adopt a binomial thinning model that allows for correlated counts 
with marginal Poisson or negative binomial distributions. Methods for sample 
size planning and blinded sample size reestimation for randomised controlled 
clinical trials with such outcomes are developed. The models and approaches are 
applicable to data with incomplete observations. A simulation study is conducted 
to assess the effectiveness of sample size estimation and blinded sample size 
reestimation methods. Sample sizes attained through these procedures are shown 
to maintain the desired study power without inflating the type I error. Data 
from a recent trial in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
illustrate the modelling approach.

rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We characterized efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 
in Mexican patients from RA Phase 3 and long-term extension (LTE) studies.
METHODS: Data from Mexican patients with RA and an inadequate response to 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were taken from four Phase 3 
studies (pooled across studies) and one open-label LTE study of tofacitinib. 
Patients received tofacitinib 5 or 10mg twice daily, adalimumab (one Phase 3 
study) or placebo (four Phase 3 studies) as monotherapy or in combination with 
conventional synthetic DMARDs. Efficacy up to Month 12 (Phase 3) and Month 36 
(LTE) was assessed by American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 response rates, 
Disease Activity Score (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and Health Assessment 
Questionnaire-Disability Index. Safety, including incidence rates (IRs; patients 
with events/100 patient-years) for adverse events (AEs) of special interest, was 
assessed throughout the studies.
RESULTS: 119 and 212 Mexican patients were included in the Phase 3 and LTE 
analyses, respectively. Tofacitinib-treated patients in Phase 3 had numerically 
greater improvements in efficacy responses versus placebo at Month 3. Efficacy 
was sustained in Phase 3 and LTE studies. IRs for AEs of special interest were 
similar to those with tofacitinib in the global and Latin American RA 
populations.
CONCLUSIONS: In Mexican patients from the tofacitinib global RA program, 
tofacitinib efficacy was demonstrated up to Month 12 in Phase 3 studies and 
Month 36 in the LTE study, with a safety profile consistent with tofacitinib 
global population.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the survival of subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) drugs used between 2008 and 2012 prescribed in accordance with clinical 
practice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective, observational study of the patients in our 
center diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We included patients who had 
received a subcutaneous anti-TNF agent for at least 6 months. The data were 
analyzed using the SPSS V17.0 statistical package.
RESULTS: Forty-nine RA patients started subcutaneous biological treatment with 
an anti-TNF agent (32 with etanercept and 17 with adalimumab). The mean age was 
45.94 years (75.5% female). The mean disease duration prior to starting anti-TNF 
administration was 2.67 years. The mean age at the start of treatment was 51.84 
years, and the average Disease Activity Score 28 was 4.93. The median survival 
of the anti-TNF treatment was 8.40 years; the survival of etanercept was the 
longer of the two. The main reason for discontinuation was secondary failure 
(90.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: In routine clinical practice, the survival of subcutaneous anti-TNF 
treatment was extensive and was independent of whether or not the patients 
received concomitant immunosuppressive therapy.

OBJECTIVES: Case reports describe neuropsychiatric manifestations associated 
with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPlAbs). In patients sharing the same symptoms 
fulfilling the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) clinical criteria, the prevalence 
of common mental disorders has, however, never been studied.
METHODS: We observed women with three consecutive abortions before the 10th week 
of gestation or one foetal loss at or beyond the 10th week. We compared the 
prevalence of common psychiatric disorders detected through screening using the 
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, 10 years after inclusion, in 
women with APS (n = 506), women negative for aPlAbs but carrying the F5rs6025 or 
F2rs1799963 thrombogenic polymorphism (n = 269), and women with negative 
thrombophilia screening results as controls (n = 764).
RESULTS: Similar prevalence values were obtained for controls and women bearing 
one of the two thrombogenic polymorphisms. Women with APS more frequently had 
mood disorders (relative risk (RR) 1.57 (1.262-1.953), P = .0001) and anxiety 
(RR 1.645 (1.366-1.979), P < .0001). Within the APS group, lupus anticoagulant 
(LA) and anti-β2GP1 IgG, or triple positivity, were strong risk factors for mood 
disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with obstetric APS have a higher risk of positive screening 
for common mental disorders than women without APS.

OBJECTIVES: The course and long-term outcome of pure membranous lupus nephritis 
(MLN) are little understood. The aims of this study are to evaluate the clinical 
features, course, outcome and prognostic indicators in pure MLN and to determine 
the impact of ethnicity and the type of health insurance on the course and 
prognosis of pure MLN.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of 150 patients 
with pure MLN from Spain and the USA.
RESULTS: Mean age was 34.2±12.5 and 80% were women. Sixty-eight percent of 
patients had nephrotic syndrome at diagnosis. The average serum creatinine was 
0.98±0.78mg/dl. Six percent of patients died and 5.3% developed end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD). ESRD was predicted by male sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, high 
basal 24h-proteinuria, high basal serum creatinine and a low basal creatinine 
clearance. Age, cardiac insufficiency, peripheral artheriopathy, hemodialysis 
and not having received mycophenolate mofetil or antimalarials for MLN predicted 
death.
CONCLUSIONS: Pure MLN frequently presents with nephrotic syndrome, high 
proteinuria and normal serum creatinine. Its prognosis is favourable in 
maintaining renal function although proteinuria usually persists over time. 
Baseline cardiovascular disease and not having a health insurance are related 
with poor prognosis.

The purpose of this article is to explore whether any differences exist between 
the general population and patient based preferences towards EQ-5D-5L defined 
hypothetical health states. The article discusses the role of adaptation and 
self-interest in valuing health states and it also contributes rigorous 
empirical evidence to the scientific debate on the differences between the 
patient and general population preferences towards hypothetical health states. 
Patient preferences were elicited in 2015 with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire using 
time trade-off and discrete choice experiment design and compared to the Spanish 
general population preferences, which were elicited using identical methods. 
Patients were chosen on a voluntary basis according to their willingness to 
participate in the survey. They were recruited from patient organisations and a 
hospital in Madrid, Spain. 282 metastatic breast cancer patients and 333 
rheumatoid arthritis patients were included in the sample. The analysis revealed 
differences in preferences between the general population and patient groups. 
Based on the results of our analysis, it is suggested that the differences in 
preferences stem from patients being more able to accurately imagine 
"non-tangible" dimensions of health states (anxiety or depression, and pain or 
discomfort) than the general population with less experience in various health 
states. However, this does not mean that general public values should not be 
reflected in utilities derived for coverage decision making.

Immunoresponsive Autonomic Neuropathy in Sjögren Syndrome-Case Series and 
Literature Review.

Goodman BP.

BACKGROUND: Sjögren syndrome (SS) is one of the most common autoimmune disorders 
that classically affects exocrine glands, resulting in keratoconjunctivitis 
sicca and xerostomia, and frequently is associated with other systemic symptoms. 
SS appears to have a particular predilection for involving the autonomic nervous 
system.
STUDY QUESTION: Does immunotherapy improve signs and symptoms of autonomic 
nervous system impairment in SS?
STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective review of patients seen in the autonomic 
clinic at our institution who underwent an evaluation for a suspected autonomic 
disorder that ultimately was attributed to SS. SS patients who were treated with 
immunotherapy and completed autonomic testing before and after treatment were 
included in this review.
RESULTS: A total of 4 patients were identified who were treated for SS-related 
autonomic dysfunction with immunotherapy and underwent repeat autonomic testing 
after treatment. Marked clinical and functional improvement was seen after 
treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin in all patients and adjunctive 
rituximab therapy in 1 patient. The clinical improvement with immunotherapy in 
these patients correlated with markedly improved findings on autonomic testing 
in all.
MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: Clinical symptoms and results of autonomic testing prior 
to and following immunotherapy were assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic signs and symptoms in SS are potentially 
immunoresponsive, but immunotherapy in these patients may require repeated, 
ongoing, or adjunctive therapy for optimal and sustained improvement.

PURPOSE: To report a case of IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD) which 
presented as choroidal and orbital lesions.
METHODS: Case report.
RESULTS: A 64-year-old man presented with left eye photopsias and a history of 
IgG4-related perirenal fibrosis. Fundoscopic examination showed multiple 
bilateral yellow choroidal lesions, and optical coherence tomography showed 
multiple choroidal lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed an 
enhancing lesion present circumferential to the optic nerve, but greater 
medially, abutting the posterior surface of the left globe. Workup for 
infectious, autoimmune, and malignant etiologies was negative, and the patient 
has responded well to treatment with rituximab.
CONCLUSION: IgG4-related disease is a systemic fibroinflammatory disease, which 
often presents in another location, as in our patient. In cases of uncertain 
choroidal and orbital lesions, a thorough workup for other etiologies is 
indicated, and lymphoma must be ruled out. Steroids are the mainstay of 
treatment for IgG4-ROD, however, small case series and our patient responded 
well to rituximab. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of 
choroidal and orbital lesions secondary to IgG4-ROD.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to determine the regulatory role of 
N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, in interleukin 17 (IL-17)-induced 
osteoclast differentiation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: After RA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated by IL-17, the expression 
and production of receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (RANKL) was 
determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Osteoclastogenesis was also determined after 
co-cultures of IL-17-stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts, Th17 cells and various 
concentrations of NAC with monocytes. After human peripheral CD4+ T cells were 
cultured with NAC under Th17 condition, IL-17, interferon γ, IL-4, Foxp3, RANKL, 
and IL-2 expression and production was determined by flow cytometry or ELISA.
RESULTS: When RA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated by IL-17, IL-17 stimulated 
the production of RANKL, and NAC reduced the IL-17-induced RANKL production in a 
dose-dependent manner. NAC decreased IL-17-activated phosphorylation of 
mammalian target of rapamycin, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and inhibitor of κB. 
When human peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes were cultured with macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor and IL-17 or RANKL, osteoclasts were differentiated, 
and NAC reduced the osteoclastogenesis. After human peripheral CD4+ T cells were 
co-cultured with IL-17-pretreated RA synovial fibroblasts or Th17 cells, NAC 
reduced their osteoclastogenesis. Under Th17 polarizing condition, NAC decreased 
Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 and RANKL production.
CONCLUSION: NAC inhibits the IL-17-induced RANKL production in RA synovial 
fibroblasts and IL-17-induced osteoclast differentiation. NAC also reduced Th17 
polarization. NAC could be a supplementary therapeutic option for inflammatory 
and bony destructive processes in RA.

Illinois.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To describe a case of bilateral macular edema appearing 
after treatment with rituximab.
METHODS: This is a case report describing macular edema after rituximab 
infusions. The information was collected retrospectively through chart review.
RESULTS: A 53-year-old patient known for IgG4-related disease of the face and 
sinuses presented with bilateral decreased visual acuity from cystoid macular 
edema shortly after undergoing two rituximab infusions. Laboratory workup did 
not reveal any underlying systemic etiology. Treatment with topical and oral 
corticosteroids as well as with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
injections led to mild improvement. Treatment with intraocular triamcinolone 
resulted in complete resolution of the edema, although accompanied by an 
increase in intraocular pressure.
CONCLUSION: Rituximab has been previously associated with macular edema. Macular 
edema causing visual loss shortly after receiving rituximab may respond to 
discontinuation of the rituximab and local steroid injection.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease affecting multiple 
systems, and its various symptoms are often mistaken for other diseases. This 
case report describes a 15-year-old girl who presented to the emergency 
department with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain, facial swelling, joint 
pain, low-grade fever, and rash. An initial autoimmune process was suspected, 
and, with prompt referral, a diagnosis of SLE was confirmed. This case report 
and discussion review the difficulty of diagnosing SLE and the importance of 
maintaining autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, on an emergency physician's 
differential.

AIM: The aim of this qualitative study was to report the findings of the 
Defining rheumatoid arthritis progression using Doppler Ultrasound in Clinical 
practice (DEDUCE) Medical Practice Activity, which was developed to facilitate 
the utilization of Doppler ultrasound (DUS) by Australian rheumatologists in the 
treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHOD: Twenty-one rheumatologists recruited a total of 80 patients with RA in 
Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28) remission for DUS assessment and 
completed a pre- and post-activity questionnaire assessing their experience with 
DUS, as well as a 6-month follow-up questionnaire. Rheumatologists discussed DUS 
results with patients using visual aids. Patients completed a pre- and post-DUS 
assessment questionnaire. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Following completion of the activity, 95% of rheumatologists (20/21) 
believed DUS was a useful assessment tool for patients with RA. The majority 
found the DUS results useful and more than half thought the DUS assessment fit 
well into their consultation. A majority of rheumatologists indicated they would 
use DUS imaging in patients with low disease activity and remission, and for 
disease activity assessment to inform in therapeutic decision-making. All 
patients who responded found the visual aids useful and most felt that 
discussing DUS results improved understanding of their disease and would help 
with medication adherence.
CONCLUSION: Incorporation of DUS imaging into routine clinical practice is 
feasible, encourages rheumatologists to utilize and expand their clinical 
application of DUS imaging in patients with RA, and may improve patient 
understanding of their disease and adherence to medication.

Purpose: To analyze the patterns and causes of intraocular inflammation in 
patients attending uveitis referral clinics in Egypt. Methods: The study 
included 454 patients with uveitis examined both at the Department of 
Ophthalmology, Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, and tertiary uveitis referral 
clinics in Cairo and the International Eye Clinic in Upper Egypt, between August 
2013 and March 2016. All patients had a comprehensive ocular examination and 
systemic work-up. Standard diagnostic criteria for uveitis syndromes were 
employed for all patients and ancillary ocular or systemic investigations were 
ordered as required by the suspected uveitis entity. Results: The mean age at 
presentation was 30 years (range: 4-75). The male to female ratio was 1.1:1. 
Panuveitis was the most common anatomic pattern (43%), followed by anterior 
(40.7%), posterior (9%), and intermediate uveitis (7.3%). Anterior uveitis was 
most commonly attributed to pediatric parasitic anterior chamber granulomas 
(22.2%). Intermediate uveitis was most commonly idiopathic (81.8%). Toxoplasma 
retinitis was the most common cause of posterior uveitis (31.7%). Behçet disease 
was the most common cause of panuveitis followed by Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) 
disease (45.6% and 22.1%, respectively). Among non-infectious etiologies, Behçet 
disease was the most frequent etiology (28.6%), while for infectious causes, 
herpetic uveitis was found to be the most frequent cause (39.8%). Conclusions: 
In this uveitis patient population from Egypt, panuveitis was the most commonly 
encountered anatomic diagnosis. Behçet disease was the most common identified 
cause of uveitis followed by VKH disease. Herpes-related uveitides and parasitic 
granulomas represented the most evident causes of infectious uveitis.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe a case of an incarcerated adolescent with acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) presenting as acute psychosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective case report followed with chart and literature 
review.
MAIN FINDINGS: An adolescent with ADEM presented with drastic behavior and 
personality changes that led to her incarceration for serious charges. Acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis leads to neuropsychiatric effects and can be seen 
with magnetic resonance imaging as a large mass effect that may result in a poor 
prognosis. This adolescent made a full recovery from her left facial droop, 
slurred speech, and left-sided hemiplegia, and her personality changes were 
reverted.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can present as acute 
psychosis; therefore, clinical suspicion is important when treating patients who 
have a history of past infectious brain diseases, especially encephalitis. Given 
the rapid onset of disease, physicians must be knowledgeable of the diagnosis 
and treatment of ADEM and be vigilant in finding organic causes of acute 
psychosis.

Digital mucous cysts are a type of benign cysts of the digits, typically located 
at the distal interphalangeal joints or in the proximal nail fold, which usually 
occur on the hands. The diagnosis of digital mucous cysts is relatively easy 
because of its light-transmitting property, but the treatment is often difficult 
because of complications including recurrence, infection, diminished range of 
motion, and nail deformity. We report a case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
showing good course after surgical treatment of mucous cyst at the 
interphalangeal joint of the great toe. In a case of RA, combination of 
synovectomy with surgical treatment of mucous cyst might be effective.

Clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in female patients 
with polysomy X have been less characterized as compared to those in male 
patients. Here, we describe a 28-year-old woman with trisomy X (47,XXX) who 
developed SLE. She had polyarthritis, hemolytic anemia, and was positive for 
anti-nuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies. We discuss the common SLE manifestations 
with female polysomy X and the possible link between the development of SLE and 
the presence of extra X-chromosomes.

Medical Research Institute, Kitano Hospital , Osaka , Japan.

A 63-year-old man presented with fever, sinusitis, otitis, and high titers of 
proteinase-3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA). Granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (GPA) was first suspected. However, nasal mucosa and skin 
biopsies revealed the presence of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL). 
We present a rare case of IVLBCL with a high titer of PR3-ANCA mimicking GPA.

The mediating effect of acceptance and mindfulness in the relationship between 
pain, depression, and physical disability was examined in 55 rheumatoid 
arthritis patients. Results showed that the relationship between pain and 
depression was mediated by both nonreact and acceptance. By contrast, the 
relationship between pain and physical disability was mediated by acceptance but 
not by nonreact. This study provides evidences that the influence of these 
processes is different on depression and on physical disability. These findings 
support models that take both general measures of mindfulness and 
content-specific measures of acceptance into account when conceptualizing 
rheumatoid arthritis. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

This study explored the association between parental fear of hypoglycemia, 
anxiety, and subjective well-being in parents of children and adolescents with 
type 1 diabetes. A total of 120 mothers and 79 fathers participated. Mothers' 
and fathers' fear of hypoglycemia was significantly associated with anxiety and 
negative affect as well as with worse glycemic control in child. Paired-samples 
t-test showed that mothers were more involved in diabetes management and 
reported more fear and anxiety compared to fathers, but they did not differ in 
worries about hypoglycemia. The findings suggest screening for fear of 
hypoglycemia and subjective well-being in all parents regardless of whether 
their child experienced severe hypoglycemia.

BACKGROUND: The increase of circulating urokinase plasminogen activator receptor 
(suPAR) was demonstrated in various diseases showing its prognostic value as 
well as the link to the inflammatory reaction. In glomerular diseases, suPAR was 
considered a causative factor of proteinuria. In the present study we aimed to 
evaluate serum concentration of suPAR in children with primary and secondary 
glomerulonephritis (GN) and its association with disease severity.
METHODS: The study involved 22 children with minimal change disease (MCD), nine 
with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), seven with 
Henoch-Schönlein nephritis, seven with lupus nephritis (LN) and 16 controls.
RESULTS: Serum suPAR was significantly higher in children with FSGS and LN than 
controls (4.47±1.39 ng/mL vs. 3.23±0.76 ng/mL; P=0.011 and 6.17±1.12 ng/mL vs. 
3.23±0.76 ng/mL, respectively; P<0.0001). Further, suPAR was increased in LN 
when compared to FSGS (P=0.031). In the total group suPAR showed negative 
correlation with eGFR, serum complement C3 and positive with left ventricular 
mass index. In children with MCD and FSGS the inverse association of suPAR with 
eGFR was also shown.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with primary and secondary glomerulonephritis suPAR 
levels are not associated with proteinuria. In primary GN elevated suPAR levels 
may result from reduced eGFR reflecting renal damage. In LN circulating suPAR 
can be increased further indicating both multi-organ involvement and systemic 
inflammation reflecting disease severity.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases, among which atherosclerotic heart disease, 
are known to be one of the most important mortality and morbidity causes in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Ischemia modified albumin (IMA) is a 
potential marker that can be used to assess atherosclerosis-related myocardial 
ischemia. Another frequently used marker for the assessment of atherosclerotic 
lesions is the carotid intima media thickness (CIMT).
AIM: To evaluate the role that IMA has on atherosclerosis development and its 
clinical usability in patients with RA, by assessing the values of IMA and CIMT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our prospective study was conducted between June 2012 and 
March 2013 at the Rheumatology Department of Necmettin Erbakan Meram Medical 
School, Turkey. Fifty-two RA patients, diagnosed according to the 1987 criteria 
of the American College of Rheumatology, and an age- and sex-matched control 
group of 46 healthy subjects were included in this study.
RESULTS: No significant difference was detected between the groups with respect 
to age, sex and body mass index. In the patient group the IMA and CIMT values 
were found to be 0.37 ± 0.12 absorbance units (ABSU) and 0.80 ± 0.22 mm, 
respectively, while in the control group they were 0.31 ± 0.11 ABSU and 
0.51 ± 0.18 mm, respectively. The IMA and CIMT values were significantly higher 
in the patient group (P = 0.022 and P < 0.0001, respectively). A positive 
correlation was found between IMA, CIMT and Disease Activity Score of 28 joints 
(P = 0.016 and P = 0.002, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Since the values of IMA were higher in the patient group compared to 
controls and because of its correlation with CIMT, we suggest the use of IMA as 
an early marker of atherosclerosis in RA patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect of Zengye Decoction (, ZYD) on 
the submandibular glands (SMGs) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice.
METHODS: Twenty-seven female NOD mice were randomly equally divided into 3 
groups: the model group, the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group, and the ZYD group. 
Nine C57/B6 mice served as the normal group. After 1-week acclimation, the HCQ 
and ZYD groups were intragastrically administered with HCQ and ZYD, 
respectively, and the normal and model groups were administered with normal 
saline. Changes in the salivary flow rate were observed. Mice from all 4 groups 
were sacrificed at the age of 20 weeks. The serum and SMGs were collected. Serum 
cytokines gamma-interferon (IFN-γ), interleukin-10 (IL-10) were detected by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Histological changes in the submandibular 
glands were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The mRNA expression of 
IFN-γ, IL-10 and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the submandibular glands 
were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the salivary flow of the ZYD group 
significantly increased (P<0.05), the extent of the histological changes was 
ameliorated (P<0.05), and the Th1/Th2 cytokine imbalance was remedied (P<0.05). 
In the ZYD-treated mice, the VIP mRNA was up-regulated (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: ZYD is beneficial in protecting structure and function of SMGs in 
NOD mice. The mechanism may be associated with the correction of the Th1/Th2 
cytokine imbalance, and with the prevention of a progressive decline of the VIP 
level.
