BACKGROUND: Teriflunomide (TRF) and Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) are licensed drugs 
for relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS).
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the rate and the time to discontinuation among 
persons with RRMS (pwRRMS), newly treated with TRF and DMF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study on prospectively collected data was 
performed in nine tertiary MS centers, in Italy. The 24-month discontinuation 
rate in the two cohorts was the primary study outcome. We also assessed the time 
to discontinuation and reasons of therapy withdrawn. Discontinuation of TRF and 
DMF was defined as a gap of treatment ≥ 60 days.
RESULTS: A cohort of 903 pwRRMS (316 on TRF and 587 on DMF) was analyzed. During 
24 months of follow-up, pwRRMS on TRF and DMF showed similar discontinuation 
rates. The analysis of predictors with Cox regression model showed differences 
between the two groups (p for log-rank test = 0.007); male gender [HR 2.21 
(1.00-4.90); p = 0.01] and the number of previous switches [HR 1.47 (1.16-1.86); 
p = 0.01] were associated with higher hazard of discontinuation in the DMF 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, pwRRMS on TRF and DMF had similar 
discontinuation rates over 24 months. Male pwRRMS on DMF with a previous history 
of therapeutic failure are at more risk of discontinuation therapy.

BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple sclerosis who experience disease breakthrough 
often switch disease-modifying therapy (DMT).
OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment effectiveness of switch to highly effective DMT 
(heDMT) with switch to moderately effective DMT (meDMT) for patients who switch 
due to disease breakthrough defined as at least one relapse within 12 months of 
their treatment switch.
METHODS: We retrieved data from The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry on all 
relapsing-remitting MS patients with expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 
less than 6 who experienced disease breakthrough. We used propensity score 
matching to compare annualized relapse rates (ARRs), time to first confirmed 
relapse, time to first confirmed EDSS worsening and time to first confirmed EDSS 
improvement.
RESULTS: Each matched group comprised 404 patients. Median follow-up time was 
3.2 years [interquartile range (IQR) 1.7-5.8]. ARRs were 0.22 (0.19-0.27) with 
heDMT and 0.32 (IQR 0.28-0.37) with meDMT; relapse rate ratio was 0.70 (95% 
CI 0.56-0.86; p = 0.001). Escalation to heDMT reduced the hazard of reaching a 
first relapse (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.53-0.80; p < 0.001). We found no evidence of 
delayed disability worsening (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.62-1.10; p = 0.20) and weak 
evidence of disability improvement (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.00-1.76; p = 0.05) with 
heDMT.
CONCLUSION: Switching to heDMT is associated with reduced ARR and delay of first 
relapse compared with switching to meDMT. Patients on DMT who experience 
relapses should escalate therapy to heDMT.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a chronic autoimmune skin disease. Aquaporin 3 (AQP 
3) has a possible role in the pathogenesis of many dermatological diseases. In 
this work, we aimed to evaluate the expression of AQP 3 in BP. Perilesional skin 
biopsies were taken from 24 BP patients and 13 controls. The biopsies were 
stained by direct immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-human AQP 3 FITC 
antibody. The expression of AQP 3 was weak in 5 patients (20.8%), moderate in 18 
patients (75%), strong in 1 patient (4.2%) in the suprabasal layers. It was 
negative in 4 patients (16.7%), weak in 18 patients (75%), moderate in 2 
patients (8.3%) and no strong fluorescence was seen in the basal layers. In the 
controls, the expression was strong in ten controls (76.9%), moderate in three 
controls (23.1%) and no controls showed weak fluorescence in the suprabasal 
layer. The basal layer showed strong fluorescence in 11 controls (84.6%), 
moderate in 2 controls (15.4%) and no controls showed mild or no fluorescence. 
There was a statistically significant difference in the expression of AQP 3 
between basal and suprabasal layers of BP patients but not of the controls. 
There was statistically significant difference in the expression of AQP 3 
between patients and controls in both the basal (P value < 0.001) and the 
suprabasal layers (P value < 0.001). In conclusion, AQP 3 was downregulated in 
BP patients especially in the basal cell layer. This suggests that AQP 3 plays a 
role in the pathogenesis of BP.

B cells have multiple actions on different phases of an immune reaction, mainly 
resulting in B and T cell-interaction (help), production of cytokines, 
regulation of dendritic cells and downregulation of regulatory B cells. The 
effectiveness of B cell depletion therapy is probably due to blockade of the 
antigen-presenting function of B cells, occurring very early in the setting of 
autoimmune reactions. B cells undergo a maturation process from stem cells 
during which the CD 20 antigen, which is the target of rituximab (RTX), is 
expressed from the stage of pre-B cells to mature and memory B cells, but not on 
plasma cells. During the maturation process, the cytokine B cell stimulating 
factor (BAFF) induces maturation of B cells and expansion of clones to produce 
plasma cells and eventually antibodies. The effect of RTX in GO is rather rapid, 
with significant improvement of the disease already 4-6 weeks after the first 
RTX infusion. Based on the evidence of significant lymphocytic infiltration in 
the orbits of patients with active GO, it is reasonable to postulate that RTX 
may cause depletion of B cells and block their antigen-presenting cell 
mechanism. Since it has been reported that serum BAFF concentrations are 
elevated in hyperthyroid GD patients and that BAFF is expressed on the 
thyrocytes of patients with either autoimmune disease or nodular goiter, the 
hypothesis that belimumab, an anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody, may be effective in 
patients with active GO his currently being tested in a randomized controlled 
trial.

BACKGROUND: Recently, poor patient satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA) has gained attention mainly in osteoarthritis (OA) patients; however, 
satisfaction after TKA remains to be understood in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
patients. This study aimed to examine satisfaction and function after RA TKA 
using patient-reported outcome measures and to compare the results with those of 
OA-TKA.
METHODS: This study enrolled 534 TKAs of 501 patients consisting of 75 TKAs of 
70 RA patients and 459 TKAs of 431 OA patients. Data of patient-reported outcome 
measures such as new Knee Society Score 2011, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and 
Pain DETECT Score were collected at 2 years. Multiple regression analysis was 
performed with Knee Society Score satisfaction score set as a dependent variable 
in order to clarify factors affecting patient satisfaction. Principle component 
analysis was performed, and satisfaction and function components were compared 
between RA and OA.
RESULTS: All activity scores were significantly lower in RA TKA than in OA TKA, 
whereas the range of motion and patient satisfaction scores were significantly 
better in RA TKA than in OA TKA. Scores for symptom, expectation, basic 
activity, and discretional activity positively affected patient satisfaction (P 
< .001), while Pain Catastrophizing Scale negatively did (P = .021). 
Importantly, diagnosis of RA itself pushed up the patient satisfaction score by 
1.5 points. Principle component analysis revealed that RA TKA achieved 
significantly higher satisfaction component (P = .001), but lower function 
component (P < .0001) compared to OA TKA.
CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction was better but functional activity was lower in 
RA than in OA. As poor functional activity was evident preoperatively in RA 
patients, to improve functional outcome should be future challenge for RA TKA.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of a trial to evaluate web-based 
physiotherapy compared to a standard home exercise programme in people with 
multiple sclerosis.
DESIGN: Multi-centre, randomized controlled, feasibility study.
SETTING: Three multiple sclerosis out-patient centres.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 90 people with multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability 
Status Scale 4-6.5).
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a six-month individualized, home 
exercise programme delivered via web-based physiotherapy ( n = 45; intervention) 
or a sheet of exercises ( n = 45; active comparator).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures (0, three, six and nine months) included 
adherence, two-minute walk test, 25 foot walk, Berg Balance Scale, physical 
activity and healthcare resource use. Interviews were undertaken with 24 
participants and 3 physiotherapists.
RESULTS: Almost 25% of people approached agreed to take part. No 
intervention-related adverse events were recorded. Adherence was 40%-63% and 
53%-71% in the intervention and comparator groups. There was no difference in 
the two-minute walk test between groups at baseline (Intervention-80.4(33.91)m, 
Comparator-70.6(31.20)m) and no change over time (at six-month 
Intervention-81.6(32.75)m, Comparator-74.8(36.16)m. There were no significant 
changes over time in other outcome measures except the EuroQol-5 Dimension at 
six months which decreased in the active comparator group. For a difference of 
8(17.4)m in two-minute walk test between groups, 76 participants/group would be 
required (80% power, P > 0.05) for a future randomized controlled trial.
CONCLUSION: No changes were found in the majority of outcome measures over time. 
This study was acceptable and feasible by participants and physiotherapists. An 
adequately powered study needs 160 participants.

Despite adequate insulin regimens and concurrent treatments for Type 1 diabetes 
(T1D), many children have trouble achieving glycemic control, as evidenced by 
elevated HbA1c levels. Maternal and child depressive symptoms, as well as child 
perceived stress, are associated with less optimal glycemic control. Cortisol, a 
stress hormone, may mediate the relationships among depressive symptoms, 
perceived stress, and glycemic control. The purposes of this pilot study were to 
(1) examine the feasibility of collecting salivary samples to measure cortisol 
change in prepubertal school-age children diagnosed with T1D and (2) determine 
effect sizes for the relationships among maternal depressive symptoms and child 
depressive symptoms, perceived stress, cortisol levels, and glycemic control. 
Participants were recruited using convenience sampling from a pediatric 
endocrinology clinic in the southeastern United States. All data, including 
surveys, salivary samples, HbA1c, height, and weight, were collected the same 
day as a clinic visit. The study included 30 children, ages 6.9-12.2 years, and 
their mothers. Most children were female (70%) and Caucasian (76.7%), but the 
sample was socioeconomically diverse. HbA1c values ranged from 6.1% to 12.2%. Of 
the children, 18 showed normal declines in cortisol over 3 hr, while 12 had 
increases in cortisol. Results show recruitment, participation, and data 
collection are feasible in school-age children with T1D. Examination of 
relevancy thresholds for effect sizes between variables of interest supports the 
need for future research in a larger, more representative sample on research 
questions that include the role cortisol plays as a potential mediator among 
examined variables.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating symptom and 
experienced by most patients. In recent studies investigating this phenomenon, 
the majority of patients had a relapsing-remitting disease course.
METHODS: Patients with progressive MS participating in one of three treatment 
trials during a period from 2010 to 2014 were included. Fatigue was assessed 
with the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) and patients 
were further examined with a cognitive test battery, including Symbol Digit 
Modalities Test (SDMT), and 3 T MRI with subsequent quantitative analyses of 13 
cortical regions of interest, deep grey matter and lesion volume.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled. The thickness of the pre-central 
gyrus correlated significantly with motor fatigue. We found only a 
non-significant trend towards a correlation between cognitive fatigue and the 
thickness of the pre-central gyrus, the parietal inferior supra-marginal gyrus 
and the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. 36% of participants had 
impaired processing speed and 9% had normal function on all tests. The scores on 
the FSMC-cognitive scale were related to performance on SDMT.
CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study of patients with progressive MS, fatigue 
was related to processing speed. Motor fatigue was also related to the cortical 
thickness of the primary motor cortex and there was a trend towards a 
relationship between cognitive fatigue and the thickness of cortical areas 
involved in attentional processes. Additional studies are needed to further 
elucidate the relationship between regional cortical atrophy, cognitive 
functioning and the perception of fatigue.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder manifested via chronic 
inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration inside the central nervous 
system. The progressive phase of MS is characterized by neurodegeneration, but 
unlike classical neurodegenerative diseases, amyloid-like aggregation of 
self-proteins has not been documented. There is evidence that citrullination 
protects an immunodominant peptide of human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 
(MOG34-56) against destructive processing in Epstein-Barr virus-infected 
B-lymphocytes (EBV-BLCs) in marmosets and causes exacerbation of ongoing MS-like 
encephalopathies in mice. Here we collected evidence that citrullination of MOG 
can also lead to amyloid-like behavior shifting the disease pathogenesis toward 
neurodegeneration. We observed that an immunodominant MOG peptide, MOG35-55, 
displays amyloid-like behavior upon site-specific citrullination at positions 
41, 46, and/or 52. These amyloid aggregates are shown to be toxic to the 
EBV-BLCs and to dendritic cells at concentrations favored for antigen 
presentation, suggesting a role of amyloid-like aggregation in the pathogenesis 
of progressive MS.

AIMS: Linear immunoglobin A (IgA) bullous dermatosis is a rare autoimmune 
dermatosis considered spontaneous or drug-induced (DILAD). We assessed all DILAD 
cases, determined the imputability score of drugs and highlighted suspected 
drugs.
METHODS: Data for patients with DILAD were collected retrospectively from the 
French Pharmacovigilance network (from 1985 to 2017) and from physicians 
involved in the Bullous Diseases French Study Group and the French Investigators 
for Skin Adverse Reactions to Drugs. Drug causality was systematically 
determined by the French imputability method.
RESULTS: Of the 69 patients, 42% had mucous membrane involvement, 20% lesions 
mimicking toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), 21% eosinophil infiltrates and 10% 
keratinocytes necrosis. Direct immunofluorescence, in 80%, showed isolated 
linear IgA deposits. Vancomycin (VCM) was suspected in 39 cases (57%), 11 had 
TEN-like lesions, as compared with three without VCM suspected. Among the 33 
patients with a single suspected drug, 85% had an intrinsic imputability score 
of I4. Among them, enoxaparin, minocycline and vibramycin were previously 
unpublished. For all patients, the suspect drug was withdrawn; 15 did not 
receive any treatment. First-line therapy for 31 patients was topical steroids. 
Among the 60 patients with available follow-up, 52 achieved remission, 10 
without treatment. Four patients experienced relapse, four died and five had 
positive accidental rechallenges.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no major clinical difference between DILAD and idiopathic 
linear IgA bullous dermatosis, but the former features a higher prevalence of 
patients mimicking TEN. VCM, suspected in more than half of the cases, might be 
responsible for more severe clinical presentations. We report three new putative 
drugs.

INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have high expression levels of 
hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, and hsa-miR-155-5p in peripheral blood. We 
studied if baseline blood levels of these microRNAs (miRNAs) could predict 
response to methotrexate (MTX).
METHODS: RA patients (the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League 
Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria) with active disease (disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)-naïve and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) > 3.2) 
were enrolled. They were treated with MTX by gradually increasing dose up to 
25 mg/week. After 4 months, the DAS28 score was calculated and EULAR response 
was assessed. The hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, and hsa-miR-155-5p levels 
were measured by real-time qPCR in whole-blood RNA at baseline and 4 months 
after therapy, using hsa-let-7a-5p as housekeeping gene. Results are expressed 
as median (interquartile range).
RESULTS: The 94 enrolled patients (81 females) had a median age of 40 (17) 
years, disease duration of (24) months, and DAS28 4.61 (1.11). After 4 months of 
therapy, 73 were classified as responders and 21 as non-responders. Baseline 
levels of all three miRNAs were lower in responders than non-responders, 
hsa-miR-132-3p (- 8.03 (0.70) versus - 7.47 (0.85), P < 0.05), hsa-miR-146a-5p 
(- 5.11 (0.88) versus - 4.62 (0.90), P < 0.05), and hsa-miR-155-5p (- 7.59 
(1.07) versus - 7 (0.72), P = 0.002). Receiver operating characteristic curve 
analysis showed that all three miRNAs were also good predictors of MTX response, 
showing the following values: hsa-miR-132-3p (area under curve (AUC) 0.756, 
P < 0.05), hsa-miR-146a-5p (AUC 0.760, P < 0.05), and hsa-miR-155-5p (AUC 0.728, 
P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, and hsa-miR-155-5p are potential 
biomarkers of responsiveness to MTX therapy.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have altered bone 
metabolism and are at risk of osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to examine 
bone turnover markers in relation to vitamin D, disease activity, and clinical 
risk factors in patients with established SLE.
METHODS: Clinical registry and biorepository data of 42 SLE patients were 
assessed. Serum samples were analyzed for osteocalcin as a marker of bone 
formation, C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) as a marker for bone 
resorption, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D.
RESULTS: Patients with a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 
2000 (SLEDAI) score of 3 or greater had a lower median osteocalcin level ( 
P = 0.02) and lower 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels ( P = 0.03) than those with a 
score of less than 3. No significant differences in bone turnover markers were 
observed between patients dichotomized into subgroups using a 25-hydroxy vitamin 
D cut-off of 30 ng/mL or by a daily prednisone dose greater than or 5 mg or 
less. Osteocalcin levels were negatively correlated with SLEDAI scores ( 
P = 0.034), and were positively correlated with the CTX index (a ratio of 
measured CTX value to the upper limit of the normal value for age and gender) ( 
P < 0.01). No association between the CTX index and SLEDAI scores was found.
CONCLUSION: SLE disease activity may have direct effects on bone formation, but 
no effects on bone resorption in this cohort of established SLE patients, 
probably related to the inflammation-suppressing effects of glucocorticoids, 
thereby inhibiting cytokine-induced osteoclast activity. A fine balance exists 
between disease control and the use of glucocorticoids with regard to bone 
health.

AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 10% intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIG; Flebogamma® 10% DIF) in individuals with chronic immune thrombocytopenic 
purpura (ITP).
PATIENTS & METHODS: Patients aged 3-70 years, diagnosed with chronic ITP, 
received 1 g/kg IVIG over two consecutive days.
RESULTS: 64 evaluable patients (51 adults, 13 children) with chronic ITP 
received IVIG. The primary efficacy end point (increased platelet counts from 
≤20 × 109/l to ≥50 × 109/l by day 8) was achieved by 81.3% of patients; mean 
time to response was 1.7 days (all responders). Adverse events, mostly mild or 
moderate, were reported in 59 patients (92.2%).
CONCLUSION: Flebogamma® 10% DIF administered over two consecutive days was safe 
and effective in adults and children with chronic ITP.

The most representative kidney lesion of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is 
plasma cell-rich tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) with distinctive imaging 
findings including multiple low-density lesions on contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography. In addition, membranous glomerulonephritis is a representative 
glomerular lesion of this disease. Recent advances have clarified that 
inflammation with IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates is not restricted to the 
renal parenchyma, but can be seen in outside the renal capsule, around 
medium-sized arteries such as lobar arteries, around nerves, and in the renal 
pelvis and periureter. Hypocomplementemia is a very important feature of 
IgG4-TIN, and serum complement level might serve as a convenient biomarker to 
predict relapse. Although good responsiveness to glucocorticoid has been 
considered characteristic of IgG4-RD, delayed start of treatment is associated 
with partial scarring in the kidneys on imaging study. Therefore, steroid 
therapy should be immediately initiated as soon as the diagnosis of IgG4-TIN is 
made. Future analyses of pathogenesis will be needed to more precisely define 
the optimal therapeutic strategies for the various subsets of Ig4-RD patients.

AIMS: To assess the association between vascular complications of diabetes and 
the risk of congenital malformations in pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study in women with 
Type 1 diabetes who received care consecutively from three tertiary care 
diabetes-in-pregnancy clinics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Multivariable 
logistic regression was used to assess the association between vascular 
complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and pre-existing hypertension) and 
congenital malformations in offspring of women with Type 1 diabetes.
RESULTS: Of 232 women with Type 1 diabetes, 49 (21%) had at least one vascular 
complication and there were 52 babies with congenital malformations. Maternal 
age (31.8 ± 5.0 vs. 29.4 ± 4.7 years, P < 0.01), diabetes duration (20.9 ± 6.7 
vs. 11.2 ± 7.4 years, P < 0.01) and pre-eclampsia rate (12.5% vs. 1.3%, 
P < 0.01) were higher in mothers with vascular complications than in those 
without. Multivariable analyses showed that vascular complications were not 
associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations (odds ratio 1.16, 
95% confidence interval 0.46 to 2.88).
CONCLUSIONS: Vascular complications are common, occurring in one-fifth of 
pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, and in this study do not appear to be 
associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations in children.

OBJECTIVE: Both normal gray matter atrophy and brain tissue relaxation rates, in 
addition to total lesion volume, have shown significant correlations with 
cognitive test scores in multiple sclerosis (MS). Aim of the study was to assess 
the relative contributions of macro- and microstructural changes of both normal 
and abnormal brain tissues, probed, respectively, by their volumes and 
relaxation rates, to the cognitive status and physical disability of MS 
patients.
METHODS: MRI studies from 241 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were 
retrospectively analyzed by fully automated multiparametric relaxometric 
segmentation. Ordinal backward regression analysis was applied to the resulting 
volumes and relaxation rates of both normal (gray matter, normal-appearing white 
matter and CSF) and abnormal (T2-weighted lesions) brain tissues, controlling 
for age, sex and disease duration, to identify the main independent contributors 
to the cognitive status, as measured by the percentage of failed tests at a 
cognitive test battery (Rao's Brief Repeatable Battery and Stroop test, 
available in 186 patients), and to the physical disability, as assessed by the 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).
RESULTS: The R1 relaxation rate (a putative marker of tissue disruption) of the 
MS lesions appeared the single most significant contributor to cognitive 
impairment (p < 0.001). On the contrary, the EDSS appeared mainly affected by 
the decrease in R2 of the gray matter (p < 0.0001), (possibly influenced by 
cortical plaques, edema and inflammation).
CONCLUSIONS: In RR-MS the tissue damage in white matter lesions appears the 
single main determinant of the cognitive status of patients, likely through 
disconnection phenomena, while the physical disability appears related to the 
involvement of gray matter.

Alemtuzumab-a monoclonal antibody targeting the CD52 glycoprotein expressed by 
most mature leucocytes-effectively decreases relapse rate and disability 
progression in early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). However, 
secondary autoimmune disorders complicate therapy in nearly 50% of treated 
patients, with Graves' disease being the most common. Rarely, thyroid eye 
disease (TED) ensues; only seven such cases have been reported. Our aim was to 
analyse the largest series of MS patients developing thyroid eye disease after 
alemtuzumab treatment. We performed a retrospective chart review of MS patients 
treated with alemtuzumab (1995-2018) and subsequently identified by their 
treating physicians as having developed TED and referred to our ophthalmology 
service. As an original trial centre for alemtuzumab, our hospital has treated 
approximately 162 MS patients with this novel therapy. In total, 71 (44%) 
developed thyroid dysfunction, most of whom (87%) developed Graves' disease, 
with ten (16%) referred for ophthalmological evaluation. Two developed active 
orbitopathy following radioiodine treatment; one occurred after cessation of 
anti-thyroid drug treatment. Three developed sight-threatening disease requiring 
systemic immunosuppression, with one refractory to multiple immunosuppressants. 
The remaining patients were treated conservatively. TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) 
levels were significantly raised in all cases, when ascertained. We report 
sight-threatening as well as mild TED in MS patients after treatment with 
alemtuzumab. Endocrine instability, radioiodine treatment and positive TRAb are 
all likely risk factors. The data support at least 6-monthly biochemical and 
clinical assessment with a low threshold for referral to an ophthalmologist, 
particularly for those with higher TRAb levels who may be at greater risk of 
orbitopathy.

BACKGROUND: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease. Dysarthria, 
dysphagia, and difficulty swallowing as exclusive initial and primary complaints 
in MG (laryngeal MG) are rare and seldom reported.
METHODS: Here we review and analyze the largest series of laryngeal MG patients.
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients with laryngeal MG as primary manifestation were 
found in 20 case reports/series. Dysarthria was the most frequent primary 
symptom (14/30), followed by dysphagia (11/30), slurred speech (4/30) and 
dysphonia (1/30). Sixty-three percent visited the otolaryngology department 
first. Only 23.33% of patients were diagnosed with MG at the first clinic visit. 
Forty-five percent laryngeal MG patients were acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 
antibody positive, 52.9% showed decremental response in the repetitive nerve 
stimulation (RNS) test, and 92.6% were positive in the neostigmine/edrophonium 
test. Fluctuating weakness was examined in 16 of 30 patients and observed in 
14/16 patients.
CONCLUSION: Laryngeal MG is a rare and possibly under-diagnosed condition. The 
patients can present with dysarthria, dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing. 
Fluctuation in severity of disease by neostigmine/edrophonium test is a typical 
feature for MG patients. AChR antibody and RNS tests should be included to 
evaluate the pathologic changes in the neuromuscular junction.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships 
among multiple sclerosis (MS)-related symptoms, sleep hygiene behaviors, and 
sleep quality in adults with MS who self-report fatigue.
BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a frequent, prevalent symptom among adults with MS. Few 
studies have examined the relationship among fatigue and other symptoms with 
sleep quality and sleep behaviors.
DESIGN: This is a descriptive correlational study.
METHODS: A convenience sample of 39 adults with MS were recruited for the study. 
Instruments used included the revised MS Related Symptom Scale and the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Correlations examined the relationships among 
fatigue and other MS symptoms with sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviors.
RESULTS: The frequency of several symptoms correlated with poor sleep quality, 
and fatigue frequency was higher in those who used electronic devices and 
practiced poor sleep hygiene behaviors.
NURSING IMPLICATIONS: Nurses should incorporate interventions for symptoms that 
impact sleep quality. These findings suggest that sleep hygiene education should 
be a part of routine clinical care.
CONCLUSION: Adults with MS experience the burden of many symptoms that impact 
sleep quality. Interventions that include education to improve symptoms, sleep 
hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality are needed.

PURPOSE: To examine the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with 
thyroid eye disease (TED) who showed asymmetric lacrimal gland enlargement.
METHODS: Sixteen patients were included in this retrospective, observational 
case series. The following data were collected: sex, age, laterality, past 
medical history, laboratory results for thyroid function and other autoimmune 
disorders, pathological results, other systemic lesions related to lacrimal 
gland pathology, and the clinical course after treatment.
RESULTS: The results of pathological examinations were consistent with 
non-specific dacryoadenitis in seven patients, immunoglobulin G4-related 
dacryoadenitis in four patients, sarcoidosis in two patients, and 
xanthogranuloma in one patient, respectively. The remaining two patients were 
proven to be extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid 
tissue type (MALT lymphoma). One patient with sarcoidosis was noted to have 
another related systemic lesion. After treatment or observation, the lesions 
were either improved or stable in almost all patients, except for the two 
patients with MALT lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TED who present with asymmetric lacrimal gland 
enlargement need to be further evaluated. Biopsy of the lacrimal gland and full 
systemic work-up should be considered as these may lead to detection of other 
pathological entities, especially malignancies, which could help in saving 
patients' lives.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a case series of previously undiagnosed granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (GPA) patients who presented primarily with otological 
manifestations.
METHOD: We report a series of patients visited at a neurotology clinic who were 
eventually diagnosed with GPA based on their otologic complaints and had no 
prior knowledge of having this condition.
RESULTS: In this series, 10 (91%) patients presented with hearing loss (HL), 
more than half of which were bilateral (60%). Upon audiometric examination, all 
but 1 patient had mixed, conductive, or sensorineural HL. All patients presented 
with eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD), otitis media with effusion (OME), or 
both. Nasal endoscopy showed intranasal pathology in 3 (27%) patients. Otologic 
symptoms were improved in all patients after treatment with an average of 4 
in-office follow-up appointments.
CONCLUSION: GPA should be included in the differential diagnosis of adults with 
unexplained mixed hearing loss, new onset serous effusion, or acute otitis media 
in the absence of a previous history of ETD. Laboratory tests (ie, 
anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and 
C-reactive protein) along with a urinalysis can aid in screening these patients. 
In cases in which the index of suspicion is high, repeated testing could reduce 
the risk of false negative findings.

Retrospective Study.

Heidelberg, Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies demonstrated a higher brain volume loss in the 
first year after initiation of natalizumab treatment than in the second year, 
but the experiences beyond 24 months are scarce until now. We investigated the 
evolution of brain volume changes in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving 
natalizumab for at least 60 months.
METHODS: Using annual 3-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition 
gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequences acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), we investigated percentage brain volume changes (PBVCs) in 10 MS 
patients (9 women, mean age at baseline MRI = 29 ± 9 years; median Expanded 
Disability Status Scale = 2 ± 1.5; mean disease duration = 6 ± 5 years) after 
12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.
RESULTS: PBVCs were statistically higher during the first 12 months 
(-1.48 ± 1.05%) when compared to 12-24 months (-.6 ± .61%; P < .05), but not 
between 12-24 and 24-36 months (-.43 ± .54%), 24-36 and 36-48 months 
(-.28 ± .49%), and 36-48 and 48-60 months (-.33 ± .49%; P > .05 for all 
comparisons).
CONCLUSION: Our results contribute to the increasing knowledge of PBVCs in 
natalizumab-treated MS patients. Our data suggests that after a significant PBVC 
decrease in the first year, brain atrophy rates show a slowdown during long-term 
follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) are responsible for autoimmune 
hyperthyroid disease (Graves' disease; GD) with TRAb levels tending to decrease 
following treatment. Measurement of TRAb activity during follow-up could prove 
valuable to better understand treatment effectiveness.
STUDY DESIGN: TRAb concentration and stimulating (TSAb) and blocking (TSBAb) 
activity of patient serum were assessed following different treatment modalities 
and follow-up length.
METHODS: Sixty-six subjects were recruited following treatment with carbimazole 
(n = 26), radioiodine (n = 27) or surgery (n = 13). TRAb, TPOAb, TgAb and GADAb 
were measured at a follow-up visit as well as bioassays of TSAb and TSBAb 
activity.
RESULTS: Forty-five per cent of all patients remained TRAb-positive for more 
than one year and 23% for more than 5 years after diagnosis, irrespective of 
treatment method. Overall, TRAb concentration fell from a median (IQR) of 6.25 
(3.9-12.7) to 0.65 (0.38-3.2) U/L. Surgery conferred the largest fall in TRAb 
concentration from 11.4 (6.7-29) to 0.58 (0.4-1.4) U/L. Seventy per cent of 
TRAb-positive patients were positive for TSAb, and one patient (3%) was positive 
for TSBAb. TRAb and TSAb correlated well (r = 0.83). In addition, 38/66 patients 
were TgAb-positive, 47/66 were TPOAb-positive and 6/66 were GADAb-positive at 
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: TRAb levels generally decreased after treatment but persisted for 
over 5 years in some patients. TRAb activity was predominantly stimulatory, with 
only one patient demonstrating TSBAb. A large proportion of patients were 
TgAb/TPOAb-positive at follow-up. All treatment modalities reduced TRAb 
concentrations; however, surgery was most effective.

OBJECTIVES: To explore whether patients in an adherence trial who appeared not 
to take disease modifying therapy (DMT) for avoidance reasons could be reliably 
identified, by observational coding, for their main reason of not taking DMT. To 
determine whether reason groups could be distinguished by clinical and 
self-report psychological characteristics and intervention outcomes.
METHOD: Participants were multiple sclerosis patients (N = 78, 88.5% female, 
mean age 45.64) demotivated to take DMT. Audio recordings of the sessions were 
coded for the main reason of not taking DMT. Reason groups were compared based 
on patient characteristics and intervention outcomes.
RESULTS: Avoidance and three other reasons for not taking DMT (side effects, 
cost, and mild course) were reliably identified (κ = 0.88). Patient 
characteristics failed to distinguish participants in the Avoidance group, which 
also had poorer outcomes (X2 [2, n = 73] = 6.35, p = 0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients not taking DMT for avoidance reasons may need novel 
methods to identify them and encourage (re-)initiation.

The formation of a glial scar does not prohibit remyelination in an animal model 
of multiple sclerosis.

The role of astrocytes in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is 
discussed controversially. Especially the formation of the glial scar is often 
believed to act as a barrier for remyelination. At the same time, astrocytes are 
known to produce factors that influence oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) 
survival. To explore these mechanisms, we investigated the astrocytic reaction 
in an animal model induced by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte 
glycoprotein (MOG) in Dark Agouti (DA) rats, which mimics most of the 
histological features of MS. We correlated the astroglial reaction by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to the 
remyelination capacity by in situ hybridization for mRNA of proteolipid protein 
(PLP), indicative of OPCs, over the full course of the disease. PLP mRNA peaked 
in early remyelinating lesions while the amount of GFAP positive astrocytes was 
highest in remyelinated lesions. In shadow plaques, we found at the same time 
all features of a glial scar and numbers of OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes, 
which were nearly equal to that in unaffected white matter areas. To assess the 
plaque environment, we furthermore quantitatively analyzed factors expressed by 
astrocytes previously suggested to influence remyelination. From our data, we 
conclude that remyelination occurs despite an abundant glial reaction in this 
animal model. The different patterns of astrocytic factors and the occurrence of 
different astrocytic phenotypes during lesion evolution furthermore indicate a 
finely regulated, balanced astrocytic involvement leading to successful repair.

IMPORTANCE: Development of transient palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) with bullous 
pemphigoid (BP) has only been described in 2 isolated case reports. The clinical 
significance and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of this association are 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical characteristics and immunological profile of 
patients with BP who develop transient PPK and analyze therapeutic options and 
outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case series, patients with BP who 
developed acquired, transient PPK, and were treated at a single institution from 
January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2017, were studied.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical and immunological activity of BP, treatment 
administrated before and after PPK appearance, and patient outcomes.
RESULTS: Six patients with BP and transient PPK were identified and included in 
the study. There were 5 women and 1 man with a mean age of 72 years. At 
baseline, all patients had a generalized, multibullous BP and high serum 
anti-BP180 antibodies (mean, 130 U/mL; range, 73-150), whereas anti-BP230 
antibodies were elevated in only 1 case. The PPK appeared a mean 6.2 (range, 
2-12) months after BP diagnosis, following a prolonged period of disease 
activity with recurrent flares. When the PPK occurred, BP was uncontrolled on 
therapy (mean Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Activity Index [BPDAI] score, 57; 
range, 34-105; mean anti-BP180 antibodies titer, 122 U/mL; range, 81-150). On 
administration of additional systemic immunosuppressive therapies, the PPK 
healed progressively in a mean 4.3 months (range, 2-9), along with BP clinical 
remission in 4 of 6 patients. No relationship was found between PPK occurrence 
and anti-BP180/230 antibodies profiles. In contrast, blister fluids collected at 
the time of PPK displayed a much higher level of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) compared 
with those collected in the absence of PKK. Expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, and 
IL-22 was also enhanced in the blister fluid of patients with BP who had PPK.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first report of 6 cases 
of BP with transient PPK with extensive immunological investigation. The PPK 
appeared after a prolonged period of clinical BP activity punctuated with 
recurrent relapses, was transient, and healed after BP control with additional 
immunosuppressive therapy. Enhanced expression of a particular cytokine panel in 
the blister fluid at time of PPK could support keratinocyte proliferation as 
described in patients with psoriasis. Transient PPK could represent a clinical 
marker of severe, treatment-resistant BP.

BACKGROUND: Time to hormonal control after definitive management of 
hyperthyroidism is unknown but may influence patient and physician decision 
making when choosing between treatment options. The hypothesis is that the 
euthyroid state is achieved faster after thyroidectomy than RAI ablation.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing definitive therapy 
for hyperthyroidism was performed. Outcomes after thyroidectomy were compared to 
RAI.
RESULTS: Over 3 years, 217 patients underwent definitive therapy for 
hyperthyroidism at a county hospital: 121 patients received RAI, and 96 patients 
underwent thyroidectomy. Age was equivalent (p = 0.72). More males underwent RAI 
(25% vs 15%, p = 0.05). Endocrinologists referred for both treatments equally 
(p = 0.82). Both treatments were offered after a minimum 1-year trial of medical 
management (p = 0.15). RAI patients mostly had Graves (93%), versus 73% of 
thyroidectomy patients (p < 0.001). Thyroidectomy patients more frequently had 
eye symptoms (35% vs 13%, p < 0.001), compressive symptoms (74% vs 15%, 
p < 0.001), or were pregnant/nursing (14% vs 0, p < 0.001). While the 
thyroidectomy patients had a documented discussion of all treatment modalities, 
79% of RAI patients did not have a documented discussion regarding the option of 
surgical management (p < 0.001). Both treatment groups achieved an euthyroid 
state (71% vs 65%, p = 0.39). Thyroidectomy patients became euthyroid faster 
[3 months (2-7 months) versus 9 months (4-14 months); p < 0.001].
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism renders a patient to an euthyroid 
state faster than RAI. This finding may be important for patients and clinicians 
considering definitive options for hyperthyroidism.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Against a background of a near-universally increasing incidence 
of childhood type 1 diabetes, recent reports from some countries suggest a 
slowing in this increase. Occasional reports also describe cyclical variations 
in incidence, with periodicities of between 4 and 6 years.
METHODS: Age/sex-standardised incidence rates for the 0- to 14-year-old age 
group are reported for 26 European centres (representing 22 countries) that have 
registered newly diagnosed individuals in geographically defined regions for up 
to 25 years during the period 1989-2013. Poisson regression was used to estimate 
rates of increase and test for cyclical patterns. Joinpoint regression software 
was used to fit segmented log-linear relationships to incidence trends.
RESULTS: Significant increases in incidence were noted in all but two small 
centres, with a maximum rate of increase of 6.6% per annum in a Polish centre. 
Several centres in high-incidence countries showed reducing rates of increase in 
more recent years. Despite this, a pooled analysis across all centres revealed a 
3.4% (95% CI 2.8%, 3.9%) per annum increase in incidence rate, although there 
was some suggestion of a reduced rate of increase in the 2004-2008 period. Rates 
of increase were similar in boys and girls in the 0- to 4-year-old age group 
(3.7% and 3.7% per annum, respectively) and in the 5- to 9-year-old age group 
(3.4% and 3.7% per annum, respectively), but were higher in boys than girls in 
the 10- to 14-year-old age group (3.3% and 2.6% per annum, respectively). 
Significant 4 year periodicity was detected in four centres, with three centres 
showing that the most recent peak in fitted rates occurred in 2012.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite reductions in the rate of increase in some 
high-risk countries, the pooled estimate across centres continues to show a 3.4% 
increase per annum in incidence rate, suggesting a doubling in incidence rate 
within approximately 20 years in Europe. Although four centres showed support 
for a cyclical pattern of incidence with a 4 year periodicity, no plausible 
explanation for this can be given.

OBJECTIVE: Novel biomarkers are needed to better predict coronary artery 
calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, and diabetic 
kidney disease (DKD) in type 1 diabetes. We evaluated the associations between 
serum uromodulin (SUMOD [a biomarker associated with anti-inflammatory and renal 
protective properties]), CAC progression, and DKD development over 12 years.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n = 527, 53% females) in the Coronary 
Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study were examined during 
2002-2004, at a mean age of 39.6 ± 9.0 years and a median duration of diabetes 
of 24.8 years. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) determined by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation were measured at baseline and 
after a mean follow-up period of 12.1 ± 1.5 years. Elevated albumin excretion 
was defined as ACR ≥30 mg/g, rapid GFR decline (>3 mL/min/1.73 m2/year), and 
impaired GFR as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. SUMOD was measured on stored baseline 
plasma samples (Meso Scale Discovery). CAC was measured using electron beam 
computed tomography. CAC progression was defined as a change in the square 
root-transformed CAC volume of ≥2.5.
RESULTS: Higher baseline SUMOD level conferred lower odds of CAC progression 
(odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.97), incident elevated albumin excretion (0.37; 
0.16-0.86), rapid GFR decline (0.56; 0.35-0.91), and impaired GFR (0.44; 
0.24-0.83) per 1 SD increase in SUMOD (68.44 ng/mL) after adjustment for 
baseline age, sex, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and 
albuminuria/GFR. The addition of SUMOD to models with traditional risk factors 
also significantly improved the prediction performance for CAC progression and 
incident DKD.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline SUMOD level predicted lower odds of both CAC 
progression and incident DKD over 12 years in adults with type 1 diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disproportionately strikes 
African American women. Social support can potentially reduce disease impact. 
The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between organ damage 
and depression in African American women and how social support influences this 
relationship.
METHODS: We used a mixed methods design, analyzing self-reported data on 
lupus-related organ damage, depression, and social support in 437 African 
American women with SLE recruited in the Georgians Organized Against Lupus 
(GOAL) cohort. Moreover, we conducted interviews among 15 GOAL participants to 
gather patients' perspectives about the role of social support in people who 
live with lupus.
RESULTS: We found a significant association between organ damage and depression 
( r = 0.163, p = 0.001), as well as between depression and social support ( 
F = 17.574, p < 0.001). The quantitative analysis did not render social support 
as a significant moderator in the organ damage-depression relationship. 
Interviews, however, revealed that African American women with the most severe 
organ damage have the greatest need for support.
CONCLUSIONS: Social support is a key resource for lupus patients with high 
disease burden. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of monitoring 
depressive symptoms in this population and developing interventions aimed to 
increase social support available to lupus patients.

With the completion of the human genome project and further development of 
high-throughput genomic technologies, interest in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), 
which are defined as non-protein-coding RNAs at least 200 nucleotides in length, 
has strongly increased, and lncRNAs have become a major research direction. 
Increasing evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs are closely related to human 
growth and development and to disease occurrence via various mechanisms. lncRNAs 
also play crucial roles in the differentiation and activation of immune cells, 
and their relationships with human autoimmune diseases have received increasing 
attention. The development of biotechnology has led to the gradual discovery of 
many potential lncRNA functions. In this review, we discuss various lncRNAs that 
have been implicated in different human autoimmune diseases, focusing on their 
clinical applications as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the 
pathologies of diverse human autoimmune diseases. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AIMS: To describe self-care maintenance, monitoring, and management behaviors in 
adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), and to identify clinical and 
socio-demographic determinants of inadequate self-care.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two diabetes outpatient 
clinics in Italy. Clinical and socio-demographic characteristics were collected 
from the medical records of 181 consecutively enrolled T1DM patients. The 
Self-Care of Diabetes Inventory was used to measure self-care maintenance, 
self-care monitoring, self-care management and self-care confidence. A 
standardized 0-100 score was used for each self-care dimension. A score < 70 was 
considered inadequate self-care. Three multiple logistic regression models were 
run to find determinants of inadequate self-care maintenance, monitoring, and 
management.
RESULTS: The majority of patients had adequate self-care maintenance (74%; 
n = 134), self-care monitoring (68.5%; n = 124) and self-care confidence (87.3%; 
n = 158), while self-care management was adequate for only a minority (34.8%; 
n = 63). The odds of inadequate self-care maintenance increased by 4.5 times 
when self-care confidence was inadequate (OR adjusted 4.589; 95% 
CI 1.611-13.071; p = 0.004). The odds of inadequate self-care monitoring 
increased four times when patients had inadequate self-care confidence (OR 
adjusted 4.116; 95% CI 1.457-11.628; p = 0.008). Inadequate self-care confidence 
increased the odds of performing inadequate self-care management more than five 
times (OR adjusted 5.313; 95% CI 1.143-24.686; p = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: Self-care management is commonly inadequate in adults with T1DM. 
Self-care confidence is the most important determinant of self-care behaviors in 
this population. Educational interventions are recommended to improve self-care 
confidence in adults with T1DM.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The initial stages of type 1 diabetes are characterised by an 
aberrant islet inflammation that is in part regulated by the interaction between 
type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes and environmental factors. Chromosome 16p13 
is associated with type 1 diabetes and CLEC16A is thought to be the aetiological 
gene in the region. Recent gene expression analysis has, however, indicated that 
SNPs in CLEC16A modulate the expression of a neighbouring gene with unknown 
function named DEXI, encoding dexamethasone-induced protein (DEXI). We therefore 
evaluated the role of DEXI in beta cell responses to 'danger signals' and 
determined the mechanisms involved.
METHODS: Functional studies based on silencing or overexpression of DEXI were 
performed in rat and human pancreatic beta cells. Beta cell inflammation and 
apoptosis, driven by a synthetic viral double-stranded RNA, were evaluated by 
real-time PCR, western blotting and luciferase assays.
RESULTS: DEXI-silenced beta cells exposed to a synthetic double-stranded RNA 
(polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [PIC], a by-product of viral replication) 
showed reduced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 
(STAT) 1 and lower production of proinflammatory chemokines that was preceded by 
a reduction in IFNβ levels. Exposure to PIC increased chromatin-bound DEXI and 
IFNβ promoter activity. This effect on IFNβ promoter was inhibited in 
DEXI-silenced beta cells, suggesting that DEXI is implicated in the regulation 
of IFNβ transcription. In a mirror image of knockdown experiments, DEXI 
overexpression led to increased levels of STAT1 and proinflammatory chemokines.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These observations support DEXI as the aetiological 
gene in the type 1 diabetes-associated 16p13 genomic region, and provide the 
first indication of a link between this candidate gene and the regulation of 
local antiviral immune responses in beta cells. Moreover, our results provide 
initial information on the function of DEXI.

BACKGROUND: Only small amounts of data are available on the prescription 
frequency of physical therapies (PT) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate prescription frequencies of PT 
considering functional status and sociodemographic factors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 98,963 adults diagnosed with RA in 2013 were 
identified in claims data from the BARMER health insurance. A questionnaire was 
sent to a representative sample of 6193 people requesting information on the 
disease status. Of these 2535 persons were included who agreed to the linking of 
the questionnaire and claims data and who confirmed a diagnosis of RA. From the 
routine claims data the prescription of PT and occupational therapy as well as 
the medical discipline of the prescribing physician were analyzed. Multivariable 
logistic regression was conducted to determine which variables (age, sex, 
M05/M06 diagnosis, residential area, income, functional status and 
rheumatological care) were associated with the use of PT.
RESULTS: In 2015 a total of 47% of the study population received PT (35% 
physiotherapy, 15% thermotherapy, 15% manual therapy, 2% electrotherapy and 6% 
massage) and 3% occupational therapy. Of the PT prescriptions 37% were issued by 
general practitioners, 27% by orthopedists and 18% by rheumatologists. Women and 
persons living in the eastern states of Germany and patients with high 
functional impairment were prescribed PT more often. Income, educational status, 
seropositivity and rheumatological care did not have any influence on the 
frequency of prescription of PT.
CONCLUSION: There are deficits in the outpatient prescription of PT but without 
indications of an undersupply of population groups due to low socioeconomic 
status. In contrast to the prescription of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug 
(DMARD) treatment, PT is predominantly prescribed by general practitioners.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether having a previous 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) changed acute care needs in burn-injured 
patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study that included adult 
(aged ≥18years) patients with an acute burn injury. Control patients were 
matched with eleven patients with a history of MS at a 4:1 ratio. Outcomes 
included fluid resuscitation volumes, temperature, heart rate, mean arterial 
pressure, in-hospital complications, and hospital length of stay (LOS).
RESULTS: There were fifty-five patients included and of those, eleven had a 
documented history of MS. Fluid resuscitation volumes, temperature, heart rate, 
and mean arterial pressure were similar between groups during the resuscitation 
period (p>0.05). LOS was similar between both groups (12, IQR: 2-17 vs. median 
16, IQR: 12-21; p=0.090). However, when normalized to % TBSA burn, patients with 
MS had a significantly higher median LOS/% TBSA burned (1.2, IQR: 0.7-2.0 vs. 
2.1, IQR: 1.1-7.1; p=0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with concurrent burn injuries and MS have a significantly 
longer LOS/% TBSA burn suggesting that more time is required to heal their 
wounds. Surprisingly, there were no other significant differences in the after 
the burn acute phase between these two cohorts.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the intracranial pressure in pediatric acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis using spinal tap opening pressure on lumbar puncture, which is 
routinely performed as part of suspected acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
workup. Compared to other cerebrospinal fluid parameters such as cell count, 
protein concentration, and presence of oligoclonal bands, cerebrospinal fluid 
opening pressure is infrequently recorded.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of demographic, clinical, and laboratory 
data of children diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis admitted to 
a tertiary referral hospital between 2005 and 2016.
RESULTS: Of the 36 children diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, 
24 had the cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure documented in their records. The 
mean cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was 27.6±12.6 cmH2O, range 9-55 cmH2O 
(95% confidence interval 21.9-33.6). Cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure in the 
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis group was statistically significantly 
higher ( P = .0013, 95% confidence interval 4.2-15.0) than the accepted upper 
limit in this age group (18 cmH2O). In 10 of 24 patients (42%), the opening 
pressure was above 28 cmH2O.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased opening pressure was the most frequent cerebrospinal 
fluid abnormal finding in our cohort, which suggests a potential role of 
increased intracranial pressure in the acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
pathophysiological disease mechanism. In certain cases, the opening pressure 
value could have monitoring and therapeutic implications, and therefore its 
measurement is highlighted by this study.

Collagen type II-induced arthritis (CIA) in Dark Agouti rats, a model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), reproduces sexual dimorphism in the incidence and 
severity of the human disease. Th17 cells are central in the 
induction/propagation of autoimmune inflammation in CIA and RA. To assess 
mechanisms underlying this dimorphism in CIA rats, in lymph nodes draining 
inflamed joints and adjacent tissues (dLNs) from CIA rats of both sexes 
Th17/CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ T-regulatory cell (Treg) ratio, Th17 cell redifferentiation 
in functionally distinct subsets and Treg transdifferentiation into 
IL-17-producing cells (exTregs) were examined. In female rats (developing more 
severe CIA than their male counterparts) the higher frequency of all Th17 cells 
(reflecting partly their greater proliferation), followed by the higher 
frequency of highly pathogenic IFN-γ/GM-CSF-co-producing cells, but lower 
frequency of less pathogenic/immunoregulatory IL-10-producing cells among them 
was found. Additionally, compared with male rats, in female rats the lower 
frequency of Tregs was observed. Moreover, Tregs from female rats exhibited 
diminished proliferative and suppressive capacity (judging by PD-1 expression) 
and enhanced conversion into IL-17-producing cells. Given that TGF-β 
concentration was comparable in collagen-type II-stimulated dLN cell cultures 
from female and male rats, the shift in Th17/Treg ratio followed by augmented 
Th17 cell redifferentiation into IFN-γ/GM-CSF-co-producing cells and Treg 
transdifferentiation into IL-17-producing cells in female rats was associated 
with increased concentration of IL-6 in female rat dLN cell cultures, and the 
higher frequency of IL-1β- and IL-23-producing cells among their dLN cells. The 
lower frequency of IL-10-producing B cells, presumably B regulatory cells 
(Bregs) could also contribute to the shift in Th17/Treg ratio in female rat 
compared with male rat dLNs. Consistently, the lower expression of IL-35 (the 
cytokine promoting Treg expansion directly and indirectly, by favoring Breg 
expansion and conversion into IL-10/IL-35-producing cells) in female rat dLN 
cells was detected. Thus, the study identified putative cellular and molecular 
substrates of the sexual dimorphism in the immunopathogenesis and clinical 
outcome of CIA and suggested mechanisms to be targeted in females to improve 
control of Th17 response, and consequently clinical outcome of CIA, and possibly 
RA.

The goal of this study was to investigate the persistence with biological drugs 
in patients treated in rheumatology practices in Germany. This study included 
patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PA), or 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who received a first prescription of biological 
drugs between 2008 and 2016 (index date) in 21 rheumatology practices in Germany 
(n = 4925; Disease Analyzer database). The main outcome measure was the rate of 
persistence within 5 years of the index date. Kaplan-Meier analyses were 
performed to study treatment persistence as a function of diagnosis, gender and 
age. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the 
relationship between non-persistence and diagnosis, gender, age, and 
comorbidities. After 5 years of follow-up, the rate of persistence was 31.8% in 
patients with RA, 35.2% in those with AS, and 33.2% in those with PA (log-rank p 
value = 0.028). Furthermore, 33.8% of men and 31.9% of women were persistent 
(log-rank p value = 0.035). The rate of persistence was 20.8%, 27.9%, 33.0%, 
36.6%, 35.2%, and 32.0% in people aged ≤ 30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and 
> 70 years, respectively (log-rank p value = 0.002). The risk of discontinuation 
was lower in participants diagnosed with AS than in those diagnosed with RA 
[hazard ratio (HR) = 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.96]. In addition, 
patients aged ≤ 30 years were more likely to discontinue their biological 
therapy than those aged > 70 years (HR = 1.29; 95% CI 1.10-1.52). Persistence 
with biological drugs was low after 5 years of follow-up in rheumatology 
practices.

A case of membranous nephropathy characterized by atypical distribution 
of phospholipase A2 receptor .

Hyodo T, Saito K, Kono K, Nishi S, Itoh T, Hara S.

A 77-year-old man was referred to our hospital with persistent proteinuria and 
progressive lower leg edema. Past history was unremarkable except for 
hypertension. Autoimmune diseases, infections, and malignancies were excluded 
based on clinical and laboratory test results. Renal biopsy specimens showed 
membranous nephropathy with segmental distribution of spikes and bubbling 
appearance. Double contour formation in glomerular tufts was also observed. 
There were no proliferative changes in the glomeruli. Interstitial fibrosis and 
tubular atrophy were moderate, and no interstitial inflammation was observed. 
Arteries showed moderate sclerotic changes with hyalinosis. Immunohistochemical 
analysis revealed no thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing 7A reactivity. 
Immunofluorescence staining showed segmental granular positivity of IgG on 
glomerular tufts and focal staining of IgG on the tubular basement membranes. 
IgG deposits (subclass distribution: IgG1, 2+; IgG2, -; IgG3, 1+; IgG4, 2+) and 
phospholipase A2 receptor type 1 (PLA2R1) immunoreactivity showed similar 
distributions in both glomeruli and renal tubular basement membranes. Electron 
microscopy revealed subendothelial edema in partially collapsed glomerulus. No 
subepithelial dense deposits were observed in the glomeruli under an electron 
microscope. This is the first documented case of membranous nephropathy (MN) 
with segmental distribution of PLA2R1 in the glomeruli and focal PLA2R1 
positivity in renal tubular basement membranes. Our findings extend the 
pathological presentation of PLA2R1-associated MN. Future studies are required 
to examine the mechanistic insights of these atypical histopathological 
features. .

IgG4-related respiratory disease.

Matsui S(1).

IgG4-related diseases (IgG4-RDs), such as autoimmune pancreatitis and 
IgG4-related Mikulicz disease, are often accompanied by intrathoracic lesions, 
which are called IgG4-related respiratory disease (IgG4-RRD). IgG4-RRD has few 
subjective symptoms, and is usually detected during workup of patients with 
extra-thoracic lesions of IgG4-RD. IgG4-RRD is characterized by various 
conditions, including masses, nodules, thickening, and infiltration at numerous 
sites in the thorax through lymphatic routes. Although elevated serum IgG4 
concentrations and pathologic evidence of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with 
abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells are characteristic findings of IgG4-RD, 
other intrathoracic diseases, such as multicentric Castleman disease and 
malignancy, may present with similar findings. Developing diagnostic criteria 
for IgG4-RRD, including clinicoradiological and pathological characteristics, is 
necessary for its appropriate diagnosis.

Periaortitis and periarteritis are one of the clinical features of IgG4-related 
disease. Such vascular manifestations are reported to be present in 10-30% of 
overall IgG4-related disease, and they may also appear as an isolated lesion of 
IgG4-related disease. As other types of large vessel vasculitis, IgG4-related 
vasculitis may cause significant clinical consequences. On the other hand, the 
diagnosis of IgG4-related periaortitis/periarteritis seems to have been made on 
the basis of different diagnostic criteria in reported studies; thus far, 
difficulty seems to be present in assessing the true frequency of the disease as 
well as determining the optimal therapeutic strategy. In this review, in 
addition presenting the clinical and pathological features of IgG4-related 
periaortitis/periarteirtis, we would like to discuss on what kind of points 
should be resolved for the better understanding of vascular involvement of 
IgG4-related disease in terms of diagnosis and treatment.

Recent studies have examined the genetic correlations of single-nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) effect sizes across pairs of populations to better understand 
the genetic architectures of complex traits. These studies have estimated ρg , 
the cross-population correlation of joint-fit effect sizes at genotyped SNPs. 
However, the value of ρg depends both on the cross-population correlation of 
true causal effect sizes ( ρb ) and on the similarity in linkage disequilibrium 
(LD) patterns in the two populations, which drive tagging effects. Here, we 
derive the value of the ratio ρg/ρb as a function of LD in each population. By 
applying existing methods to obtain estimates of ρg , we can use this ratio to 
estimate ρb . Our estimates of ρb were equal to 0.55 ( SE = 0.14) between 
Europeans and East Asians averaged across nine traits in the Genetic 
Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging data set, 0.54 ( SE = 0.18) 
between Europeans and South Asians averaged across 13 traits in the UK Biobank 
data set, and 0.48 ( SE = 0.06) and 0.65 ( SE = 0.09) between Europeans and East 
Asians in summary statistic data sets for type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid 
arthritis, respectively. These results implicate substantially different causal 
genetic architectures across continental populations.

BACKGROUND: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta isoform (PI3Kδ) belongs to 
an intracellular lipid kinase family that regulate lymphocyte metabolism, 
survival, proliferation, apoptosis and migration and has been successfully 
targeted in B-cell malignancies. Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic 
immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterised by exocrine gland lymphocytic 
infiltration and B-cell hyperactivation which results in systemic 
manifestations, autoantibody production and loss of glandular function. Given 
the central role of B cells in pSS pathogenesis, we investigated PI3Kδ pathway 
activation in pSS and the functional consequences of blocking PI3Kδ in a murine 
model of focal sialoadenitis that mimics some features of pSS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Target validation assays showed significant expression of 
phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), a downstream mediator of the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) pathway, within pSS salivary glands. 
pS6 distribution was found to co-localise with T/B cell markers within pSS 
aggregates and the CD138+ plasma cells infiltrating the glands. In vivo blockade 
of PI3Kδ activity with seletalisib, a PI3Kδ-selective inhibitor, in a murine 
model of focal sialoadenitis decreased accumulation of lymphocytes and plasma 
cells within the glands of treated mice in the prophylactic and therapeutic 
regimes. Additionally, production of lymphoid chemokines and cytokines 
associated with ectopic lymphoneogenesis and, remarkably, saliva flow and 
autoantibody production, were significantly affected by treatment with 
seletalisib.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate activation of PI3Kδ pathway within the glands 
of patients with pSS and its contribution to disease pathogenesis in a model of 
disease, supporting the exploration of the therapeutic potential of PI3Kδ 
pathway inhibition in this condition.

OBJECTIVE: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) prevent autoimmunity and control 
inflammation. Consequently, any autoimmune or inflammatory disease reveals a 
Treg insufficiency. As low-dose interleukin-2 (ld-IL2) expands and activates 
Tregs, it has a broad therapeutic potential.
AIM: We aimed to assess this potential and select diseases for further clinical 
development by cross-investigating the effects of ld-IL2 in a single clinical 
trial treating patients with 1 of 11 autoimmune diseases.
METHODS: We performed a prospective, open-label, phase I-IIa study in 46 
patients with a mild to moderate form of either rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, Behcet's disease, 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Takayasu's disease, Crohn's disease, 
ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis and sclerosing cholangitis. They all 
received ld-IL2 (1 million IU/day) for 5 days, followed by fortnightly 
injections for 6 months. Patients were evaluated by deep immunomonitoring and 
clinical evaluation.
RESULTS: ld-IL2 was well tolerated whatever the disease and the concomitant 
treatments. Thorough supervised and unsupervised immunomonitoring demonstrated 
specific Treg expansion and activation in all patients, without effector T cell 
activation. Indication of potential clinical efficacy was observed.
CONCLUSION: The dose of IL-2 and treatment scheme used selectively activate and 
expand Tregs and are safe across different diseases and concomitant treatments. 
This and preliminary indications of clinical efficacy should licence the launch 
of phase II efficacy trial of ld-IL2 in various autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Collagen antibodies in serum are involved in the pathogenesis of 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The objective of this study was to identify the 
subtype of collagen antibodies and T cell subtype distribution in 
pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) and to clarify their roles in the initiation 
and maintenance of arthritis.
METHODS: Arthritis was induced in Dark Agouti (DA) rats by injection of 
pristane. The severity was evaluated by macroscopic and microscopic score 
systems. The alteration of CD25+/CD4+ T cell ratio in rats was detected by flow 
cytometry. Collagen type II (CII), CIX, or CXI antibody in serum was determined 
by ELISA. The levels of Nitric oxide (NO) and tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase (TRAP) were measured by kits.
RESULTS: The serum levels of CII, CIX, CXI antibodies were significantly 
increased in RA patients while slightly increased in PIA rats. The ratio of 
CD25+/CD4+ T cells was significantly higher in RA rats than that in the control 
group. The serum levels of NO and TRAP in PIA rats and RA patients were higher 
than that in the control groups, which suggested that the activity of osteoclast 
was increased in RA.
CONCLUSION: The ratio of CD25+/CD4+ T cells plays a pivotal role in the 
development of PIA. The serum levels of NO and TRAP are inflammatory and 
osteoclast activity indicators. The serum levels of CII, CIX and CXI antibodies 
may serve as the clinical diagnostic indicators. These findings are important to 
our understanding of the pathogenesis of RA, and may provide biomarkers of RA 
diagnosis and therapeutic targets for the treatment of RA.

AIM: The inflammatory process is a key step in multiple sclerosis (MS) 
development. Carvacrol exhibits various anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed 
to assess the Carvacrol effects on clinical manifestations and production of 
pro-inflammatory (IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-17) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-β, IL-4, and 
IL-10) cytokines in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as MS animal 
model.
MAIN METHODS: EAE mice were treated with 5, 10 mg/kg dose of Carvacrol or 
vehicle, as the control EAE group, every other day until day-21 post EAE 
induction. On day22, the leukocyte infiltration within the CNS was estimated 
using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The cytokine production by splenocytes was 
determined after in vitro stimulating with myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG).
KEY FINDINGS: The EAE clinical scores in 5 and 10 mg/kg Carvacrol-treated mice 
were lower than untreated group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). The 
amounts of IFN-γ and IL-6 production by splenocytes of 5 and 10 mg/kg 
Carvacrol-administered mice were lower than control group (P < 0.001, and 
P < 0.01 for IFN-γ respectively; P ˂ 0.05 for IL-6). Splenocytes of 5 and 
10 mg/kg Carvacrol-treated mice produced higher levels of TGF-β than untreated 
mice (P < 0.001). in splenocytes of 5 mg/kg Carvacrol-treated group the IL-10 
production was higher while IL-17 secretion was lower than control group (both 
with P < 0.01).
SIGNIFICANCE: Carvacrol exhibits modulatory effects on expression of pro- and 
anti-inflammatory cytokines. It ameliorates EAE clinical and pathological 
consequences and therefore its potentials may be considered in treating MS 
patients.

Muscle specific tyrosine kinase antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK- MG) 
is characterized by autoantibodies against the MuSK protein of the neuromuscular 
junction resulting in weakness of bulbar and proximal muscles. We previously 
demonstrated that patients with MuSK-MG have increased pro-inflammatory Th1 and 
Th17 responses. Tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant used in AChR-MG and 
transplantation patients, inhibits T cell responses through interference with 
IL-2 transcription. The therapeutic efficacy and immunological effect of 
tacrolimus in MuSK-MG is unclear. In the current study we examined the 
proliferation, phenotype and cytokine production of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MuSK-MG following a 3-day in vitro culture 
with or without tacrolimus. We determined that tacrolimus profoundly suppressed 
CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation and significantly suppressed Th1 and Th17 
responses, as demonstrated by a reduced frequency of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-17 
producing CD4 T cells and reduced frequencies of IFN-γ and IL-2 producing CD8 T 
cells. Tacrolimus also inhibits pathogenic Th17 cells coproducing IL-17 and 
IFN-γ. In addition, tacrolimus suppressed follicular T helper cell (Tfh) and 
regulatory T helper cell (Treg) subsets. These findings provide preliminary 
support for tacrolimus as a potential alternative immunosuppressive therapy for 
MuSK-MG.

INTRODUCTION: In systemic lupus erythematosus, hemostasis disorders are mainly 
thrombotic, but more rarely hemorrhagic.
CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old man presented with a macrophagic activation syndrome 
revealing a systemic lupus erythematosus, secondarily complicated by a 
hemorrhagic syndrome ; biological investigations revealed an increase thrombin 
time and an activated partial thromboplastin time, normalized by protamin 
neutralization in vitro, thus confirming the presence of a heparin-like 
anticoagulant. The hemostasis balance normalized after the specific treatment of 
lupus.
CONCLUSION: This rare anomaly of hemostasis balance has been described in blood 
cancers and solid cancers. This is the first description of a case associated 
with an autoimmune connective tissue disorder such as lupus. After one year of 
follow-up, no diagnosis of blood or solid cancer was made.

MYH9 related diseases are caused by mutations in the MYH9 gene and constitute a 
rare group of genetic entities. Its inheritance follows an autosomal dominant 
pattern. The MYH9 gene, encodes the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA, expressed 
in different tissues and especially in podocytes and mesangial cells. The 
disorder is characterized by the presence of macrothrombocytopenia, leukocyte 
inclusions and a variable risk of developing renal failure, hearing loss and 
early-onset cataracts. We describe the case of a 27-year-old Caucasian woman, 
diagnosed initially with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. After a detailed 
family history and the appearance of renal involvement and hearing loss, genetic 
testing allowed to make the diagnosis of nephropathy associated with MYH9 
mutation. This case is an example of the delayed diagnosis of uncommon diseases 
and highlights the usefulness genetic testing. A review of the disease is 
provided.

We investigated the therapeutic capacity of nano-sized graphene sheets, called 
graphene quantum dots (GQD), in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 
an animal model of immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) damage. 
Intraperitoneally administered GQD (10 mg/kg/day) accumulated in the lymph node 
and CNS cells of Dark Agouti rats in which EAE was induced by immunization with 
spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant. GQD significantly reduced 
clinical signs of EAE when applied throughout the course of the disease (day 
0-32), while the protection was less pronounced if the treatment was limited to 
the induction (day 0-7 post-immunization) or effector (from day 8 onwards) phase 
of the disease. GQD treatment diminished immune infiltration, demyelination, 
axonal damage, and apoptotic death in the CNS of EAE animals. GQD also reduced 
the numbers of interferon-γ-expressing T helper (Th)1 cells, as well as the 
expression of Th1 transcription factor T-bet and proinflammatory cytokines tumor 
necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor in the lymph nodes and CNS immune infitrates. The protective effect of 
GQD in EAE was associated with the activation of p38 and p42/44 
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Akt in the lymph nodes and/or CNS. 
Finally, GQD protected oligodendrocytes and neurons from T cell-mediated damage 
in the in vitro conditions. Collectively, these data demonstrate the ability of 
GQD to gain access to both immune and CNS cells during neuroinflammation, and to 
alleviate immune-mediated CNS damage by modulating MAPK/Akt signaling and 
encephalitogenic Th1 immune response.

Reliable monitoring of clinical relevant anti-drug antibodies is fundamental in 
the follow-up of patients under adalimumab treatment. The aim of this study is 
to compare anti-adalimumab antibodies by using three methods based on different 
technologies. A cross-sectional study was performed in 50 patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with adalimumab. Anti-adalimumab antibodies 
were detected in patients' sera by different techniques: bridging ELISA, 
reporter gene assay (RGA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Results showed 
that all methods recognized anti-adalimumab antibodies and the percentage of 
positives fluctuated among the assays. Five (10%) of the 50 patients were 
positive in ELISA, 4 (8%) in RGA, and 6 (12%) in SPR. Among positive patients, 4 
were positive in the three assays, one patient uniquely in ELISA, and two in 
SPR. Spearman correlation between ELISA and RGA showed good agreement (Spearman 
r = 0.800). No correlation between RGA and SPR was observed (Spearman 
r = 0.108). Similar results were obtained between ELISA and SPR (Spearman r = - 
0.241). Summarizing, ELISA, RGA and SPR recognized anti-adalimumab antibodies in 
few RA patients, showing good agreement among the methodology employed. On the 
other hand, differences observed between SPR and ELISA or RGA highlight the 
relevance of the employed technologies in anti-drug antibody identification.

    Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 2020 Aug;166:108275.

Optimal care for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes is well described 
in guidelines, such as those of the International Society for Pediatric and 
Adolescent Diabetes. High-income countries can usually provide this, but the 
cost of this care is generally prohibitive for lower-income countries. Indeed, 
in most of these countries, very little care is provided by government health 
systems, resulting in high mortality, and high complications rates in those who 
do survive. As lower-income countries work toward establishing guidelines-based 
care, it is helpful to describe the levels of care that are potentially 
affordable, cost-effective, and result in substantially improved clinical 
outcomes. We have developed a levels of care concept with three tiers: "minimal 
care," "intermediate care," and "comprehensive (guidelines-based) care." Each 
tier contains levels, which describe insulin and blood glucose monitoring 
regimens, requirements for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing, complications 
screening, diabetes education, and multidisciplinary care. The literature 
provides various examples at each tier, including from countries where the life 
for a child and the changing diabetes in children programs have assisted local 
diabetes centres to introduce intermediate care. Intra-clinic mean HbA1c levels 
range from 12.0% to 14.0% (108-130 mmol/mol) for the most basic level of minimal 
care, 8.0% to 9.5% (64-80 mmol/mol) for intermediate care, and 6.9% to 8.5% 
(52-69 mmol/mol) for comprehensive care. Countries with sufficient resources 
should provide comprehensive care, working to ensure that it is accessible by 
all in need, and that resulting HbA1c levels correspond with international 
recommendations. All other countries should provide Intermediate care, while 
working toward the provision of comprehensive care.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are chronic inflammatory 
demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system that often affect women 
during childbearing years. Therefore, issues of conception, pregnancy, and 
delivery are of significant importance to patients and treating physicians. The 
current review provides updated information regarding the effects of pregnancy 
on MS and NMO, as well as the available safety data on immunomodulatory MS 
therapies for pregnant and lactating women. Management issues of women with MS 
and NMO during conception, gestation, and the postpartum period also are 
addressed.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fluctuating 
weakness of extraocular and proximal limb muscles. It occurs in 1 in 5000 in the 
overall population and is 2 times more common in women than men. The onset in 
women is most common in the third decade, and risk of severe exacerbation occurs 
most frequently in the year after presentation. The disease does not have an 
impact on fertility and overlap with pregnancy is expected. This article 
provides a description of the disease process and its impact on the expecting 
mother, fetus, and newborn. Management options in pregnancy and lactation are 
discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pattern of change in blood glucose concentrations and 
hypoglycemia risk in response to prolonged aerobic exercise in adolescents with 
type 1 diabetes (T1D) that had a wide range in pre-exercise blood glucose 
concentrations.
METHODS: Individual blood glucose responses to prolonged (~60 minutes) 
moderate-intensity exercise were profiled in 120 youth with T1D.
RESULTS: The mean pre-exercise blood glucose concentration was 178 ± 66 mg/dL, 
ranging from 69 to 396 mg/dL, while the mean change in glucose during exercise 
was -76 ± 55 mg/dL (mean ± SD), ranging from +83 to -257 mg/dL. Only 4 of 120 
youth (3%) had stable glucose levels during exercise (ie, ± ≤10 mg/dL), while 4 
(3%) had a rise in glucose >10 mg/dL, and the remaining (93%) had a clinically 
significant drop (ie, >10 mg/dL). A total of 53 youth (44%) developed 
hypoglycemia (≤70 mg/dL) during exercise. The change in glucose was negatively 
correlated with the pre-exercise glucose concentration (R2 = 0.44, P < 0.001), 
and tended to be greater in those on multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) vs 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (-98 ± 15 vs -65 ± 7 mg/dL, P = 
0.05). No other collected variables appeared to predict the change in glucose 
including age, weight, height, body mass index, disease duration, daily insulin 
dose, HbA1c , or sex.
CONCLUSION: Youth with T1D have variable glycemic responses to prolonged aerobic 
exercise, but this variability is partially explained by their pre-exercise 
blood glucose levels. When no implementation strategies are in place to limit 
the drop in glycemia, the incidence of exercise-associated hypoglycemia is ~44% 
and having a high pre-exercise blood glucose concentration is only marginally 
protective.

BACKGROUND: The PAPA syndrome, an acronym for pyogenic sterile arthritis, 
pyoderma gangraenosum and acne, is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease 
which is caused by a mutation in the PSTPIP1 ("proline-serine-threonine 
phosphatase interacting protein 1") gene located on chromosome 15 and encodes 
the proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1. An association 
with Crohn's disease (CD), autoimmune diseases of the liver and PAPA syndrome 
has not yet been reported in the literature.
OBJECTIVE: To thoroughly investigate a family with three affected members 
(mother and 2 children) with newly diagnosed PAPA syndrome and intestinal and 
hepatobiliary symptoms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed an in-depth phenotyping, dermatologic, 
radiologic, rheumatologic, gastroenterologic, histologic and genetic analysis in 
this family.
RESULTS: All three family members could be newly diagnosed as suffering from 
PAPA syndrome and carried the known disease-causing mutation c.688G > A 
(p.Ala230Thr) in the PSTPIP1 gene. The younger son suffered from CD in addition 
to PAPA syndrome. The mother additionally suffered from ulcerative colitis (UC) 
and an overlap syndrome between autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). A mutation in in the NOD2 ("nucleotide binding 
oligomerization domain containing protein 2") gene could not be detected in any 
of the three persons affected.
CONCLUSION: We extended the symptoms of PAPA syndrome to CD and autoimmune liver 
disease. These different disease entities might share a similar pathogenetic 
mechanism or even represent a new syndrome. This can be clarified in the future 
by screening patients with PAPA syndrome for intestinal and also hepatobiliary 
diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether structural brain network metrics correlate better 
with clinical impairment and information processing speed in multiple sclerosis 
(MS) beyond atrophy measures and white matter lesions.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 51 healthy controls and 122 
patients comprising 58 relapsing-remitting, 28 primary progressive and 36 
secondary progressive. Structural brain networks were reconstructed from 
diffusion-weighted MRIs and standard metrics reflecting network density, 
efficiency and clustering coefficient were derived and compared between 
subjects' groups. Stepwise linear regression analyses were used to investigate 
the contribution of network measures that explain clinical disability (Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS)) and information processing speed (Symbol Digit 
Modalities Test (SDMT)) compared with conventional MRI metrics alone and to 
determine the best statistical model that explains better EDSS and SDMT.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, network efficiency and clustering coefficient 
were reduced in MS while these measures were also reduced in secondary 
progressive relative to relapsing-remitting patients. Structural network metrics 
increase the variance explained by the statistical models for clinical and 
information processing dysfunction. The best model for EDSS showed that reduced 
network density and global efficiency and increased age were associated with 
increased clinical disability. The best model for SDMT showed that lower deep 
grey matter volume, reduced efficiency and male gender were associated with 
worse information processing speed.
CONCLUSIONS: Structural topological changes exist between subjects' groups. 
Network density and global efficiency explained disability above non-network 
measures, highlighting that network metrics can provide clinically relevant 
information about MS pathology.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease 
characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as 
interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF 
induces IL-17 secretion and MIF promoter polymorphisms influence the expression 
of selected downstream mediators. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
relationship between known functional MIF haplotypes and Th17-related cytokine 
secretion profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from control 
subjects (CS) and RA patients stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 
recombinant human MIF (rhMIF). The -794 CATT5-8 and -173G > C polymorphisms of 
the MIF gene were determined by conventional PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. The 
most frequent haplotypes of the MIF polymorphism and PBMC were identified from 
three subjects homozygous for each haplotype and in both study groups, the PBMC 
were obtained and stimulated with LPS or rhMIF. The secretion of cytokines 
related to the Th17 profile was determined by a multiplex immunoassay (MAGPIX). 
LPS stimulation induced the secretion of cytokines related to the Th17 profile 
in PBMC from CS and RA patients, whereas, rhMIF only stimulated this response in 
PBMC from RA patients. PBMC from CS carriers of the MIF 7C haplotype showed more 
IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-23 secretion than non-7C carriers after LPS 
stimulation. In the case of rhMIF stimulation, the PBMC from CS carriers of the 
7C haplotype secreted more IL-17A and IL-23 than non-7C carriers. In conclusion, 
genetic variants of the MIF promoter modulate the secretion of cytokines related 
to the Th17 profile in PBMC from CS inducing a differential response in 
comparison to PBMC from RA patients.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototype of systemic 
autoimmune disease, characterized by loss of immune tolerance against 
self-antigens where autoantibody production is the hallmark of disease. 
B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are 
cytokines that promote autoreactive cell survival, immunoglobulin-class 
switching and autoantibody responses in human and mouse SLE models. BAFF and 
APRIL exert their functions through interactions with their receptors BAFF-R and 
TACI that are differentially expressed in B lymphocyte subsets, monocytes, 
dendritic cells and T lymphocytes. BAFF stimulation favors T lymphocyte 
activation and cytokine production through BAFF-R, which could contribute to the 
Th1, Th17 and/or Th2 response dysregulation observed in SLE patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of the cytokines BAFF and APRIL and their 
association with the receptors BAFF-R and TACI on CD3+ T cells and to evaluate 
Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profile in patients with SLE.
METHODS: Fifteen healthy controls (HC) and 36 SLE patients were included, and 
their demographic and clinical data were assessed. The disease activity index 
(Mex-SLEDAI) and damage index (SLICC) were applied to the SLE patients. BAFF-R 
and TACI expression on CD3+ T cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. Serum BAFF 
and APRIL concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 
(ELISA). Cytokine levels of Th1 (IL-12, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α), Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, 
IL-10, IL-13) and Th17 (IL-1β e IL-17) were quantified with a multiplex assay 
(MAGPIX). Statistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics v.20 and 
GraphPad Prism v.6 software.
RESULTS: No differences in BAFF-R or TACI expression on the CD3+ T cells of SLE 
and HC were observed. BAFF-R expression correlates inversely with disease 
activity (r = -0.538, p < 0.01), while TACI correlates with disease activity 
(r = 0.530, p < 0.05). Serum BAFF and APRIL levels were high in SLE patients and 
correlated with the disease activity index Mex-SLEDAI (r = 0.621, p < 0.01 and 
r = 0.416, p < 0.05). SLE patients were found to have significantly higher 
levels of IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-1β and IL-17 compared to 
HC (p < 0.05). Cytokines IL-17 (r = 0.526) and TNF-α (r = 0.410) correlate with 
disease activity (p < 0.05), while APRIL (r = 0.477), IL-10 (r = 0.426) and 
IFN-γ (r = 0.440) levels were associated with organ damage (p < 0.01). Serum 
BAFF expression levels correlate with IL-4 (r = 0.424; p < 0.05), IL-6 
(r = 0.420; p < 0.05) and IL-10 (r = 0.459; p < 0.01), whereas APRIL levels 
correlate with IL-2 (r = 0.666; p < 0.01), IL-12 (r = 0.611; p < 0.01) and TNF-α 
(r = 0.471; p < 0.05) cytokines. A subgroup of SLE patients with high serum BAFF 
levels (>2 ng/mL) also showed increased APRIL, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10 levels 
(p < 0.05). Finally, BAFF, IL-4 and TNF-α serum levels were associated with high 
titers of antinuclear antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates an imbalance in the Th1/Th2 cytokine 
profile, with increased proinflammatory cytokines, as well as BAFF and APRIL 
serum levels. Associations of BAFF with Th2 profile cytokines and disease 
activity, as well as APRIL with Th1 profile cytokines and organ damage, suggest 
that BAFF and APRIL generated in the autoimmunity context could through still 
unknown mechanisms, modulate the microenvironment, and perpetuate the 
inflammatory response, autoantibody production and organ damage observed in SLE 
patients.

Type I Interferon (IFN) is widely used for multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment, 
but its side effects are limiting and its mechanism of action still unknown. 
Furthermore, 30-50% of MS patients are unresponsive, and IFN can even induce 
relapses. Fundamental understanding of the cellular target(s) of IFN will help 
to optimize treatments by reducing side effects and separating beneficial from 
detrimental effects. To improve clinical systemic IFN usage, we are developing 
AcTaferons (Activity-on-Target IFNs = AFNs), optimized IFN-based immunocytokines 
that allow cell-specific targeting. In experimental autoimmune encephalitis 
(EAE) in mice, high dose WT mIFNα could delay disease, but caused mortality and 
severe hematological deficits. In contrast, AFN targeted to dendritic cells (DC, 
via Clec9A) protected without mortality or hematological consequences. 
Conversely, CD8-targeted AFN did not protect and exacerbated weight loss, 
indicating the presence of both protective and unfavorable IFN effects in EAE. 
Comparing Clec9A-, XCR1-and SiglecH-targeting, we found that targeting AFN to 
plasmacytoid (p) and conventional (c) DC is superior and non-toxic compared to 
WT mIFN. DC-targeted AFN increased pDC numbers and their tolerogenic potential, 
evidenced by increased TGFβ and IDO synthesis and regulatory T cell induction. 
In addition, both regulatory T and B cells produced significantly more 
immunosuppressive TGFβ and IL-10. In conclusion, specific DC-targeting of IFN 
activity induces a robust in vivo tolerization, efficiently protecting against 
EAE, without noticeable side effects. Thus, dissecting positive and negative IFN 
effects via cell-specific targeting may result in better and safer MS therapy 
and response rates.

Monogenic diabetes is caused by mutations that reduce β-cell function. While 
Sanger sequencing is the standard method used to detect mutated genes. 
Next-generation sequencing techniques, such as whole exome sequencing (WES), can 
be used to find multiple gene mutations in one assay. We used WES to detect 
genetic mutations in both permanent neonatal (PND) and type 1B diabetes (T1BD). 
A total of five PND and nine T1BD patients were enrolled in this study. WES 
variants were assessed using VarioWatch, excluding those identified previously. 
Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the mutations, and their pathogenicity was 
established via the literature or bioinformatic/functional analysis. The PND and 
T1BD patients were diagnosed at 0.1-0.5 and 0.8-2.7 years of age, respectively. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis was present at diagnosis in 60% of PND patients and 44.4% 
of T1BD patients. We found five novel mutations in five different genes. 
Notably, patient 602 had a novel homozygous missense mutation c.1295C > A 
(T432 K) in the glucokinase (GCK) gene. Compared to the wild-type recombinant 
protein, the mutant protein had significantly lower enzymatic activity (2.5%, 
p = 0.0002) and Vmax (1.23 ± 0.019 vs. 0.33 ± 0.016, respectively; p = 0.005). 
WES is a robust technique that can be used to unravel the etiologies of 
genetically heterogeneous forms of diabetes. Homozygous inactivating mutations 
of the GCK gene may have a significant role in PND pathogenesis.

In rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain can persist despite resolution of swelling. 
Similarly, in the murine K/BxN serum transfer model, a persistent tactile 
allodynia is observed after the resolution of joint inflammation 
(post-inflammatory pain) in male mice. Here, we found female wild type (WT) mice 
show inflammatory, but reduced post-inflammatory tactile allodynia. The 
transition to the post-inflammatory phenotype is dependent on TLR4 signaling. At 
the spinal level, we found differences in TNF and IFNβ mRNA expression in WT and 
TLR4 deficient males. In wild type male and female mice, there is differential 
temporal spinal expression of TNF and IFNβ. In WT males, blockade of TNF or 
administration of IFNβ was insufficient to affect the persistent allodynia. 
However, co-administration of intrathecal (IT) IFNβ and anti-TNF antibodies in 
male WT mice permanently reversed tactile allodynia. IT IFNβ treatment induces 
expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, contributing to the beneficial effect. 
Together, these experiments illustrated differences in the transition to chronic 
tactile allodynia in male and female animals and the complexities of effective 
pharmacologic interventions.

T cells play a key role in adaptive immune responses, and shifts among T cell 
classes occur in normal pregnancy. There is evidence for the role of TH17 cells 
and dysregulation of the TH17/Treg cell balance in morbidities and autoimmune 
diseases during pregnancy. Because TH17 responses may play a role in depression 
and anxiety outside of pregnancy, we hypothesize that TH17 responses and the 
balance of TH17/Treg activity may also contribute to the development of 
depression and anxiety during pregnancy. To explore this hypothesis, this review 
has three main aims: 1) to evaluate systematically the role of TH17 cells and 
cytokines during pregnancy; 2) to compare changes in the ratio of TH17/Treg 
cells during pregnancy morbidities with the changes that occur in depression and 
anxiety outside of pregnancy; and 3) to provide a basis for further research on 
TH17 cells in perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, with an eye toward the 
development of novel therapeutics. We also review the limited literature 
concerning perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, and hypothesize about the 
potential role of TH17 cells in these illnesses. Understanding the 
pathophysiology of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders will aid development of 
novel therapeutics that address immunological mechanisms, in addition to the 
serotonin system, which are targetable molecules in treating depression and 
anxiety during pregnancy.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore caregiver’s description of 
their experience of nighttime sleep.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Caregivers (N=22) of children 10–18 years of age with T1D 
were recruited for this descriptive study. Anonymous questionnaires contained 
demographic information and both open and close-ended questions that focused on 
caregiving as it related to sleep. Open-ended questions were reviewed to help 
understand the effect of nocturnal caregiving activities on parental sleep.
RESULTS: The sample of caregivers were all female, had a mean age 43 years; 96% 
graduated high school; 68% married or partnered, 100% Caucasian. Children had 
been diagnosed with T1D for a mean of 5 years, with a mean age of 12.2 years. 
Caregivers reported short sleep duration (mean 5.8 hours). Over half of 
participants reported they required ≥ 7 hours of sleep to feel their best, 64% 
reporting trouble sleeping at night, and 86% reported that caregiving interfered 
with their night time sleep, while 54% responded that sleep was “very 
important.” Content analysis of the open ended questions revealed two themes 1) 
Anxiety about child’s blood glucose levels, 2) Nighttime disruptions
CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers are frequently sleep deprived and worry about their 
child’s nighttime glucose. Caregiving duties, anxiety, and sleep fragmentation 
may contribute to their poor sleep.

In this topical review, we discuss the history of the area postrema syndrome, 
with special attention given to early studies aimed at identifying the area 
postrema and its function, possible early cases of the syndrome and its current 
relevance in neuroimmunology and demyelinating diseases. In 1896, Retzius named 
a structure in the posterior medulla oblongata as the area postrema. The work of 
Borison in the middle of the 20th century led to the elucidation of its function 
as a "vomiting center." The historical medical literature is filled with 
excellent examples that could be described as "area postrema syndrome." While 
severe and bilateral optic neuritis and transverse myelitis still constitute the 
classic components of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), 
intractable vomiting and hiccups due to area postrema involvement is now 
recognized as essentially pathognomonic, indeed a shiny pearl in neuroimmunology 
and demyelinating diseases.

Dysregulation of melanocyte function is associated with vitiligo, an idiopathic 
autoimmune hypopigmentary skin disorder, caused by the selective destruction of 
melanocytes. Cytokines, the key mediators of immune response, which are pivotal 
in maintaining immune homeostasis, are crucial in vitiligo pathogenesis. Several 
studies indicate that there is an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines in the skin and serum of vitiligo patients. Areas covered: In this 
comprehensive review, we have summarized the correlation of cytokine imbalance 
and vitiligo pathogenesis, its role in melanocyte biology, and its impact on 
vitiligo treatment. We have integrated various published reports on the levels 
of major cytokines from skin and serum samples of vitiligo patients. We have 
also discussed the role of endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress on 
cytokine imbalance and vice versa leading to destruction of melanocytes. Expert 
commentary: The review reflects that dysregulation of cytokines is 
multifactorial, ranging from genetic predisposition to altered protein 
expression relevant to vitiligo pathogenesis. We emphasize that cytokine 
imbalance in systemic and skin microenvironment plays a crucial role in vitiligo 
pathogenesis and has promising potential as therapeutic targets for vitiligo.

Cellular barcoding of 3' mRNAs enabled massively parallel profiling of 
single-cell gene expression and has been implemented in droplet and microwell 
based platforms. The latter further adds the value for compatibility with low 
input samples, optical imaging, scalability, and portability. However, cell 
lysis in microwells remains challenging despite the recently developed 
sophisticated solutions. Here, we present scFTD-seq, a microchip platform for 
performing single-cell freeze-thaw lysis directly toward 3' mRNA sequencing. It 
offers format flexibility with a simplified, widely adoptable workflow that 
reduces the number of preparation steps and hands-on time, with the quality of 
data and cost per sample matching that of the state-of-the-art scRNA-seq 
platforms. Freeze-thaw, known as an unfavorable lysis method resulting in 
possible RNA fragmentation, turns out to be fully compatible with 3' scRNA-seq. 
We applied it to the profiling of circulating follicular helper T cells 
implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis. Our results delineate 
the heterogeneity in the transcriptional programs and effector functions of 
these rare pathogenic T cells. As scFTD-seq decouples on-chip cell isolation and 
library preparation, we envision it to allow sampling at the distributed sites 
including point-of-care settings and downstream processing at centralized 
facilities, which should enable wide-spread adoption beyond academic 
laboratories.

The earliest and most proximal triggers of inflammatory demyelination in 
multiple sclerosis (MS) remain an open question. In this DNACB review we address 
experimental and clinical evidence consistent with subtle perturbations of the 
axo-myelinic compartment of central nervous system white matter as initiation 
sites of secondary autoimmune demyelination in MS. Strengthened by experimental 
evidence that by inhibiting myelinopathy one can prevent inflammatory 
demyelination, myelin-protective therapies may represent a new class of 
anti-inflammatory medications for combating myelin autoimmunity.

A preparative separation method using macroporous absorptive resin coupled with 
high-performance liquid chromatography was developed for the separation of six 
fractions of the 80% ethanol extract of Periploca forrestii Schltr. The six 
ethanol fractions (5-95; A, B, C, D, E, and F) obtained were carefully analyzed 
to locate the corresponding peaks in the high-performance liquid chromatography 
chromatogram of the total extract, which was established in a previous study. 
Furthermore, the biological activities, including antioxidant activities, acetyl 
cholinesterase inhibitory capacities, antihyaluronidase activities, and 
anti-inflammatory effects, were evaluated in MH7A cells. The results 
demonstrated that fraction E could significantly prevent oxidation and inhibit 
hyaluronidase and acetyl cholinesterase. Finally, the main flavonoids in 
fractions A and E from P. forrestii Schltr. were purified, and the compounds 
were identified as chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside, and 
quercetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside. The chemical structures were confirmed by 
mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, the 
inhibitory effects of these compounds against complete Freund's adjuvant-induced 
secondary immune arthritis in rats were evaluated.

The rare case of a 61-year-old patient suffering from linear IgA dermatosis is 
presented. The patient was previously hospitalized with chronic inflammatory 
bowel disease. The correct diagnosis of the disease was based on clinical and 
histological findings. Serological methods, such as indirect immunofluorescence, 
ELISA and immunoblotting are suitable for identification of the autoantibodies. 
In this case the detection of IgA antibodies along the basal membrane was 
achieved by direct immunofluorescence. Other bullous dermatoses with similar 
symptoms, such as an IgG-mediated bullous pemphigoid have to be excluded. The 
therapy of linear IgA dermatosis is ensured by steroid-containing topical 
agents, alongside antiseptic measures as well as systemic dapsone p.o.

PURPOSE: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an 
immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this 
study was to describe the variability of clinical presentation in anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis, treatment and outcomes in a case series of children and 
adolescents.
METHODS: Retrospectively analyse patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis, from 2010 to 2018.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of nine children with anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis from southern Brazil, six females and three males, aged 5 months to 
16 years (mean 5 years). The time of follow-up varied between 1 and 7 years, 
with a mean of 3 years. The most frequent first manifestation consisted of 
seizures. All patients described had psychiatric symptoms and a wide spectrum of 
neurologic findings. Five patients had unilateral symptoms. Magnetic resonance 
imaging and electroencephalogram were normal in most patients. Cerebrospinal 
fluid pleocytosis occurred in five patients. All patients were administered 
immunoglobulin and/or steroids. Seven patients (78%) required cyclophosphamide 
and/or rituximab. Almost half of the patients fully recovered from all symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of symptoms were observed in this study and, 
although unilateral symptoms are rarely reported in the literature, a high 
frequency was observed among Brazilian children. Alternatives to first-line 
therapy should be considered in patients with clinical suspicion, even if they 
have not had a good response with first-line therapy.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with heterogeneous 
clinical presentation and complex etiology involving the interplay between 
genetic, epigenetic, environmental and hormonal factors. Many common SNPs 
identified by genome wide-association studies (GWAS) explain only a small part 
of the disease heritability suggesting the contribution from rare genetic 
variants, undetectable in GWAS, and complex epistatic interactions. Using 
targeted re-sequencing of coding and conserved regulatory regions within and 
around 215 candidate genes selected on the basis of their known role in 
autoimmunity and genes associated with canine immune-mediated diseases, we 
identified a rare regulatory variant rs200395694:G > T located in intron 4 of 
the MEF2D gene encoding the myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2D transcription 
factor and associated with SLE in Swedish cohorts (504 SLE patients and 839 
healthy controls, p = 0.014, CI = 1.1-10). Fisher's exact test revealed an 
association between the genetic variant and a triad of disease manifestations 
including Raynaud, anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP), and anti-Smith 
(anti-Sm) antibodies (p = 0.00037) among the patients. The DNA-binding activity 
of the allele was further studied by EMSA, reporter assays, and minigenes. The 
region has properties of an active cell-specific enhancer, differentially 
affected by the alleles of rs200395694:G > T. In addition, the risk allele 
exerts an inhibitory effect on the splicing of the alternative tissue-specific 
isoform, and thus may modify the target gene set regulated by this isoform. 
These findings emphasize the potential of dissecting traits of complex diseases 
and correlating them with rare risk alleles with strong biological effects.

OBJECTIVE: Immune complexes (ICs) play a critical role in the pathology of 
autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to generate and characterise a 
first-in-class anti-FcγRIIA antibody (Ab) VIB9600 (previously known as MEDI9600) 
that blocks IgG immune complex-mediated cellular activation for clinical 
development.
METHODS: VIB9600 was humanised and optimised from the IV.3 Ab. Binding affinity 
and specificity were determined by Biacore and ELISA. Confocal microscopy, Flow 
Cytometry-based assays and binding competition assays were used to assess the 
mode of action of the antibody. In vitro cell-based assays were used to 
demonstrate suppression of IC-mediated inflammatory responses. In vivo target 
suppression and efficacy was demonstrated in FcγRIIA-transgenic mice. 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic study multiple dose Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies were conducted in non-human primates.
RESULTS: We generated a humanised effector-deficient anti-FcγRIIA antibody 
(VIB9600) that potently blocks autoantibody and IC-mediated proinflammatory 
responses. VIB9600 suppresses FcγRIIA activation by blocking ligand engagement 
and by internalising FcγRIIA from the cell surface. VIB9600 inhibits IC-induced 
type I interferons from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (involved in SLE), 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-induced production of reactive oxygen 
species by neutrophils (involved in ANCA-associated vasculitis) and IC-induced 
tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin-6 production (involved in rheumatoid 
arthritis). In FcγRIIA transgenic mice, VIB9600 suppressed antiplatelet 
antibody-induced thrombocytopaenia, acute anti-GBM Ab-induced nephritis and 
anticollagen Ab-induced arthritis. VIB9600 also exhibited favourable PK and 
safety profiles in cynomolgus monkey studies.
CONCLUSIONS: VIB9600 is a specific humanised antibody antagonist of FcγRIIA with 
null effector function that warrants further clinical development for the 
treatment of IC-mediated diseases.

Autoimmune diseases (ADs) are a chronic and clinically heterogeneous group of 
diseases characterized by share common immunopathogenic mechanisms and risk 
factors (i.e., the autoimmune tautology), which explain the fact that one AD may 
coexist with others (i.e., polyautoimmunity - PolyA). In the present exploratory 
study, a mixed-cluster analysis of the most common autoimmune rheumatic diseases 
(ARDs) was done. A total of 187 consecutive women with established systemic 
lupus erythematosus (n = 70), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 51), systemic sclerosis 
(n = 35) and Sjögren's syndrome (n = 31) were included. A comprehensive 
clinical, autoantibody and cytokine assessment was simultaneously done. Total 
PolyA was registered in 142 (75.9%) patients. Six clusters were obtained, built 
mainly on autoantibodies: PolyA-I to -VI. The PolyA-III cluster showed the 
highest frequency of overt PolyA (p = 0.01), and the PolyA-I, -III, and -IV 
clusters exhibited the highest positivity for IL-12/23p40 (p = 0.015). These 
results provide new insights into the pathophysiology of PolyA and warrant 
prospective validation to enable development of a more accurate taxonomy of 
ARDs.

Acute idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis is frequently the initial 
manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to discuss the value of color 
vision testing to detect possible optic nerve involvement in patients with MS 
who had no history of optic neuritis. We evaluated color vision with 
Farnsworth-Munsell 100 (FM-100) hue test. Total error scores (TES), partial 
error scores for the red-green axis (RGS) and blue-yellow axis (BYS) were 
calculated. Topographic optic disc parameters (RNFL, RA, DA, CV, RV, and 
vertical C/D ratio), total macular volume (TMV), central macular thickness 
(CMT), and retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL) were determined using spectral 
domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Choroidal thickness (CT) was 
measured using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT). 
Pattern visual evoked potentials (PVEP) were also performed. Twenty-eight 
patients with RRMS (56 eyes) and 25 healthy controls (50 eyes) were included. 
P100 latencies were significantly delayed and P100 amplitudes were significantly 
reduced in the patient group compared with the controls (p ≤ 0.05). 
Statistically significant thinning was found in temporal quadrant in the patient 
group compared with the controls (p = 0.002). TES RGS, and BYS were all 
increased in the patient group but this was not statistically significant. We 
found no correlation between TES, RGS, BYS, and P100 latencies or OCT 
parameters. In our investigation as to whether color vision testing could be a 
simple biomarker for showing neurodegeneration of the anterior visual pathway 
regardless of optic neuritis, PVEP and OCT-assessed RNFL thickness seemed to be 
a more valuable biomarker than color vision testing.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) associated with malignancies is a well-known entity. 
However, its association with benign neoplasm is not broadly recognized. A 
69-year-old man with recurrent nephrotic syndrome presented with pedal edema and 
proteinuria of 5 months' duration. Laboratory results showed hypoalbuminemia and 
hyperlipidemia. Proteinuria was estimated to be protein excretion of 3.5g/d. 
Studies were negative for viral hepatitis, syphilis, human immunodeficiency 
virus, autoimmune diseases, and paraproteinemia. Kidney biopsy disclosed MN with 
negative phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) staining, favoring a secondary form 
of MN. Computed tomography detected a 7.6-cm duodenal schwannoma. Elective 
surgical resection was performed. Pathologic study showed that THSD7A 
(thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing 7A) was positive in both glomeruli and 
schwannoma. Commonly, secondary MN is related to underlying conditions, 
including lupus, hepatitis, and neoplasm, and can be medication induced. The 
risk for developing a concomitant neoplasm among patients with PLA2R-negative MN 
is up to 12 times higher than in the general population. Most of these neoplasms 
are malignancies, and the presence of autoantibodies directed at similar tissue 
targets is hypothesized as the potential mechanism. In our case, THSD7A may be 
the autoantibody that has linked the schwannoma and the development of MN. 
Although benign tumors rarely produce renal manifestations, effective treatment 
may lead to resolution of nephrotic syndrome.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by diabetogenic T cells that evaded tolerance 
mechanisms and react against multiple β-cell antigens. Antigen-specific therapy 
to reinstate tolerance (typically using a single β-cell antigen) has so far 
proved unsuccessful in T1D patients. Plasmid DNA (pDNA)-mediated expression of 
proinsulin has demonstrated transient protection in clinical trials, but 
long-lasting tolerance is yet to be achieved. We aimed to address whether pDNA 
delivery of multiple epitopes/mimotopes from several β-cell antigens efficiently 
presented to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells could also induce tolerance. This approach 
significantly delayed T1D development, while co-delivery of pDNA vectors 
expressing four full antigens protected more mice. Delivery of multiple epitopes 
resulted in a broad engagement of specific T cells, eliciting a response 
distinct from endogenous epitopes draining from islets. T-cell phenotypes also 
varied with antigen specificity. Unexpectedly, the repertoire of T cells 
reactive to the same epitope was highly polyclonal. Despite induction of some 
CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, protection from disease did not persist after 
treatment discontinuation. These data demonstrate that epitope-based tolerogenic 
DNA vaccines constitute effective precision medicine tools to target a broad 
range of specific CD4+ and CD8+ diabetogenic T-cell populations for prevention 
or treatment of T1D.

The presenting symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) include abdominal pain, 
polyuria and nausea. Diabetes has well known chronic ocular complications like 
glaucoma, cataracts and retinopathy. We report a case of reversible blindness as 
a presenting manifestation of DKA that has been reported in literature only 3 
times previously. Our objective is to highlight a rare manifestation of a common 
disease. A 59-year-old male presented with painless vision loss for 3 days and 
was found to have DKA. The blindness was completely reversed with insulin and 
bicarbonate treatment. The dramatic presentation and reversibility of blindness 
was found to be intimately tied with the pH of the patient's serum. Our report 
gives mechanistic insight for this interesting condition. Clinicians should be 
aware of reversible blindness as a complication of DKA. Timely correction of the 
severe acidosis and other metabolic disturbances of DKA may be instrumental in 
preventing permanent vision loss.

Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a subset of SLE with an 
onset before 18 years of age. Patients with early onset SLE tend to have a 
greater genetic component to their disease cause, more multisystemic 
involvement, and a more severe disease course, which includes greater risks for 
developing nephritis and end-stage kidney disease. Five- and 10-year mortality 
is lower than in adult-onset SLE. Although patient and renal survival have 
improved with advances in induction and maintenance immunosuppression, 
accumulation of irreversible damage is common. Cardiovascular and infectious 
complications are frequent, as are relapses during adolescence and the 
transition to adulthood.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often 
caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent 
hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. 
The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious 
glomerulonephritis. In most patients, and especially with isolated microscopic 
hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In those 
cases whereby a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent 
microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A 
nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis 
varies with the underlying disease.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis and immunoglobulin A nephropathy are common 
glomerulopathies in the pediatric population that deserve special attention. In 
some cases the primary care provider can follow the patient but others need more 
intensive management. Delaying this treatment can lead to worse morbidity. This 
article provides information on the pathogenesis, outcomes, and follow-up 
strategies that will aid in the diagnosis and referral of patients at risk for 
kidney disease.

Accuracy of sensors play an important role in the acceptance and long-term use 
of CGM which is related to improved glycemic outcome. This has been lower in 
children and adolescents in the past for reasons such as size of the device, 
pain, and necessity to calibrate sensors but also inaccuracy and perceived 
nonreliability on alarms among others. In the study of Welsh et al, performance 
of a new, factory-calibrated sensor was assessed. The accuracy of the sensor, as 
measured in MARD, paired values within 20/20% or 15/15% and surveillance error 
grid analysis showed very good results, although less so in low value range <70 
mg/dL, falling rate of change, and on first day of use. Accurate glucose 
measurements especially in these incidences are of utmost importance to people 
with diabetes as their treatment decisions are based on these, also in the 
beginning of sensor use.

Frequency and immunophenotype of IL10-producing regulatory B cells in optic 
neuritis.

Mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) have shown the importance of 
interleukin-10 (IL-10) -producing regulatory B (Breg) cells in dampening disease 
activity and inhibiting disease initiation and progression. In MS and other 
autoimmune diseases decreased frequency and functionality of Breg cells 
correlate with disease activity and the percentage of IL-10-producing Breg cells 
decreases during relapse and normalizes in remission. Optic neuritis (ON) is a 
common first clinical manifestation of MS and IL-10-producing Breg cells may be 
crucial in the transition from ON to MS, we therefore investigate the frequency 
and function of Breg cells in ON as a clinical model of early demyelinating 
disease. B cells were purified from 27 patients with ON sampled close to symptom 
onset (median 23 days, range 7-41 days) and 13 healthy controls. The B cells 
were stimulated and cultured for 48 hr with CD40 ligand and CpG before 
measurement of intracellular IL-10 and the surface markers CD19, CD1d, CD5, 
CD24, CD38 and CD27 by flow cytometry. The frequency of B-cell subsets was 
analysed in peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients. 
Sixty-five per cent of the IL-10-producing Breg cells co-expressed CD24 and 
CD38, and only 14% were CD24high  CD27+ , suggesting that the naive B cells are 
the primary source of IL-10 in the B-cell culture, followed by memory cells in 
both healthy controls and patients. The frequency of naive CD19+  CD24+  CD38+ 
Breg cells was higher in patients with ON compared with controls. The ability of 
Breg cells to produce IL-10 was at normal levels in both ON patients with high 
risk and those with low risk of progression to MS. We found no correlation 
between Breg cell function and the presence of brain white matter lesions by 
magnetic resonance imaging or CSF oligoclonal bands indicative of ON patients 
carrying a higher risk of conversion to MS. The frequencies of IL-10-producing B 
cells did not correlate with the conversion to MS at 2-year follow up. 
Interleukin-10 was primarily produced by naive and memory B cells. The frequency 
of IL-10-secreting B cells did not correlate with risk factors of MS. Breg cell 
function at clinical onset of ON is not a determining factor for conversion to 
MS.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), a locally aggressive neoplasm capable 
of metastasis, may show an immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-rich lymphoplasmacytic 
infiltrate. Prior reports suggest that storiform-fibrosis and obliterative 
phlebitis aid in the distinction of IMT from IgG4-related diseases. Herein, we 
highlight the morphologic overlap between the 2 diseases, and emphasize the 
importance of a multiplex fusion assay in the distinction of IgG4-related 
disease (IgG4-RD) from IMT. We identified 7 IMTs with morphologic and 
immunohistochemical features of IgG4-RD; 3 patients were originally diagnosed 
with IgG4-RD. Demographic, clinical and morphologic data was recorded. We also 
reevaluated 56 patients with IgG4-RD. We performed immunohistochemistry for 
IgG4, IgG, ALK, and ROS1. In situ hybridization for IgG4 and IgG was performed 
in selected cases. A multiplex next-generation sequencing-based RNA assay for 
gene fusions was performed to detect all known IMT-related gene fusions. All 7 
IMTs showed a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and storiform-type fibrosis, 
with obliterative phlebitis noted in 3 cases. The neoplastic stromal cells 
constituted <5% of overall cellularity and stromal atypia was either absent or 
focal and mild. Elevated numbers of IgG4 positive cells and increased IgG4 to 
IgG ratio was identified in all cases. Four cases showed ALK related 
abnormalities: 3 fusions and one alternative transcription initiation; while 2 
patients showed ROS1 and NTRK3 fusions. One tumor was negative for known 
IMT-related gene fusions. All 56 IgG4-RD cases were negative for ALK and ROS1 on 
immunohistochemistry; 6 cases were negative on the fusion assay. Highly inflamed 
IMTs are indistinguishable from IgG4-RD both histologically and on 
immunohistochemistry for IgG4. We advocate scrutinizing patients with 
presumptive single organ IgG4-RD for IMT and the diagnostic algorithm should 
include ALK and ROS1 immunohistochemistry and, in selected cases, a 
next-generation sequencing-based fusion assay that covers known IMT-associated 
gene fusions.

OBJECTIVES: Psychological stress is an important risk factor for multiple 
sclerosis (MS) onset, relapse, neurological symptoms and psychosocial adjustment 
to the disease. Mounting evidence suggests that stress management could halt the 
disease progression and improve patients' wellbeing. The aim of this study was 
to investigate the effectiveness of a novel cognitive-behavioral stress 
management technique (called Pythagorean Self-Awareness Intervention - PSAI) 
routinely used in our clinics in patients with MS.
METHODS: In this observational study, 148 MS patients receiving PSAI for 8-weeks 
were compared patients who followed only usual care. Measurements included 
cognitive function, psychological distress and physical fatigue. Propensity 
score (PS) methods (given the observational design) and linear mixed models were 
employed to address study's endpoints.
RESULTS: A total of 128 (86.5%) of MS patients fulfilled the PS criteria for 
analyses (72 in the PSAI group and 56 in the control group). Patients of 
tertiary education, longer disease duration, higher cognitive score and 
psychological distress were more likely to choose to participate in the PSAI 
group. PSAI patients were found with statistical significant beneficial changes 
in cognitive speed processing, verbal memory, stress, anxiety, depression and 
fatigue. Based on the numbers-needed-to-treat of the weighted data, PSAI was 
particularly effective in improving cognitive speed processing (NNT = 10) and 
stress (NNT = 12).
DISCUSSION: PSAI can benefit cognitive function and psychological distress in MS 
patients. Future studies should expand these results in randomized trials and by 
using longer follow-up and MS activity-related endpoints.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of dry heat treatment (fluidotherapy) in 
improving hand function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Departments of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Rheumatology in 
a university hospital.
SUBJECTS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
INTERVENTIONS: All patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 
underwent dry heat treatment (fluidotherapy) and Group 2 was a control group. 
Patients in both groups participated in a joint protection and exercise program.
MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were Health Assessment Questionnaire and 
Duruoz Hand Index. Secondary outcome measures were pain and stiffness, Grip 
Ability Test, Disease Activity Score-28, and grip strength. These assessments 
were performed at the hospital at baseline, week 3, and week 12.
RESULTS: A total of 93 participants were allocated to Group 1 ( n = 47) and 
Group 2 ( n = 46). The mean age of these groups was 54.19 ± 11.15 years and 
53.00 ± 10.15 years, respectively ( P = 0.592). At baseline, there were no 
significant differences between the groups in any parameter except significantly 
poorer Health Assessment Questionnaire score in Group 1 ( P = 0.007). At week 3, 
there were no significant differences between the groups in any of the 
parameters ( P > 0.005). At week 12, Duruoz Hand Index scores were significantly 
better in Group 2 ( P = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: Dry heat treatment (fluidotherapy) was not effective in improving 
hand function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, no positive 
effect on any other clinical parameters was observed.

AIMS: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suffer from accelerated 
atherosclerosis. Their most common cause of death is a cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), in spite of the presence of moderate lipid alterations and normal 
cardiovascular risk scores. However, cholesterol still accumulates in the 
arteries of SLE patients, so we aim to identify additional factors that may help 
explain the residual risk that exists in these patients. We focus on 
investigating whether the net charge contributes significantly to both the 
development and the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with SLE.
METHODS: The lipoproteins from 78 patients with SLE and 32 controls were 
isolated via sequential ultracentrifugation. Lipoprotein subclasses 
distributions were analyzed via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the 
net charges of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density 
lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL) were measured using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS. The degree of atherosclerosis 
(carotid intima-media thickness [cIMT]) was determined in all the participants.
RESULTS: Each lipoprotein class exhibited a negative net charge. IDL and LDL net 
charge correlated negatively with cIMT (r = -0.274, P = 0.034; r = -0.288; 
P = 0.033, respectively) in patients with SLE. This effect was independent of 
age, body mass index (BMI), gender, tobacco consumption, high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (hsCRP), lipid concentration and lipoprotein particle number. 
LDL net charge explained 4% of the cIMT variability among these patients; this 
contribution was also independent of age, BMI, gender, tobacco consumption, 
lipids levels, apolipoproteins and hsCRP.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-density lipoprotein net charge may be considered a new 
independent contributor to subclinical atherosclerosis in SLE patients. The 
observed relationship was independent of lipid concentrations and extends the 
prominent role that IDL and LDL play in cardiovascular risk.

The use of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has 
yielded a significant improvement in the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) 
associated with HCV infection. Interferon was the cornerstone of HCV therapy 
before the introduction of these agents into the clinical practice. Herein, we 
report the case of an HCV-infected patient who developed an interferon-induced 
AIH and since then, has received immunosuppressive therapy. Administration of 
DAA resulted in a sustained virologic response (SVR) and clinical AIH remission 
which allowed a discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatment.

PURPOSE: To investigate the application of en face optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) imaging in eyes with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: Setting: Institutional.
PATIENT POPULATION: Sixty-two eyes of 31 Asian patients with HCQ retinopathy.
OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: Macular volume scanning using swept-source OCT was 
performed in 6 × 6-mm and 9 × 9-mm areas centered on the fovea. Segmentation of 
the photoreceptor layers was automatically performed between the inner border of 
the ellipsoid zone and that of the retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch membrane 
complex to obtain en face OCT images. Findings from the en face images were 
qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated; they were analyzed and correlated 
with the fundus autofluorescence and visual field findings.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: En face OCT findings.
RESULTS: All eyes with HCQ retinopathy had a beaten-bronze appearance in the 
areas with photoreceptor defects, whereas those with intact photoreceptors had 
areas with smooth surfaces, which were occasionally demarcated by hyporeflective 
margins, on the en face OCT images. The presence and extent of the retinopathy 
could be quickly determined using the images. They also provided quantitative 
information on the progression based on the areas of intact photoreceptors 
compared over several visits. Furthermore, the area of central intact 
photoreceptors significantly correlated with the mean deviation, pattern 
standard deviation, and visual field index of 30-2 visual field examinations 
(all P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: En face OCT may be useful for visualizing the presence and extent 
of HCQ retinopathy and its progression. The area of central intact 
photoreceptors measured on en face OCT images showed a significant association 
with functional visual field defects. This imaging may be a helpful adjunct for 
screening and follow-up examinations of HCQ retinopathy.

High levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with a loss of 
tissue function in ocular autoimmune diseases, but the basis for this 
relationship remains poorly understood. Here we investigate a new role for tumor 
necrosis factor α in promoting N-glycan-processing deficiency at the surface of 
the eye through inhibition of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase expression in the 
Golgi. Using mass spectrometry, complex-type biantennary oligosaccharides were 
identified as major N-glycan structures in differentiated human corneal 
epithelial cells. Remarkably, significant differences were detected between the 
efficacies of cytokines in regulating the expression of glycogenes involved in 
the biosynthesis of N-glycans. Tumor necrosis factor α but not IL-1β had a 
profound effect in suppressing the expression of enzymes involved in the Golgi 
branching pathway, including N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases 1 and 2, which are 
required for the formation of biantennary structures. This decrease in gene 
expression was correlated with a reduction in enzymatic activity and impaired 
N-glycan branching. Moreover, patients with ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid 
were characterized by marginal N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase expression and 
decreased N-glycan branching in the conjunctiva. Together, these data indicate 
that proinflammatory cytokines differentially influence the expression of 
N-glycan-processing enzymes in the Golgi and set the stage for future studies to 
explore the pathophysiology of ocular autoimmune diseases.

Rheumatology has evolved rapidly over the past 20 years. The availability of 
numerous treatment interventions has dramatically altered patient outcomes and 
revitalized the specialty. At the same time, the economics of medical practice 
is challenging the practicing rheumatologist to seek more efficient and more 
attractive models of care delivery. These models of care must be attractive not 
only to rheumatologists and their patients but also to other interested parties 
as well, such as payers, government agencies, and accreditation bodies.

Despite evidence that treat-to-target (TTT) approaches lead to better disease 
outcomes in RA, TTT is not widely implemented in rheumatology clinics in North 
America. This article discusses the barriers (including access to care, patient 
and physician factors, and systems issues) to implementing TTT in the clinic, 
and proposes possible solutions and future research directions.

Antibody drugs are effective therapeutic agents and provide treatment for many 
types of diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. Because many antibody 
drugs are developed and approved, quantification technologies of antibodies are 
required for drug development and individualized therapy. We recently reported a 
high reproducible and robust therapeutic drug monitoring method for antibody 
drugs. This method was developed to be applicable to all type of antibody drugs 
and to provide accurate quantification values. The method is named nano-surface 
and molecular-orientation limited (nSMOL) proteolysis. nSMOL limits the access 
of protease to immunoglobulin G molecules and aims to selectively proteolyze on 
Fab region of substrate. However, the bioanalysis of Tocilizumab using nSMOL has 
not been validated. We newly discovered that acidified reduction pretreatment of 
Tocilizumab promotes digestive efficiency by nSMOL proteolysis. Exposure of 
Tocilizumab to Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride before nSMOL 
proteolysis significantly improved the recovery of peptides. Under this 
condition, the quantification range of Tocilizumab in human serum was from 0.781 
to 200 μg/mL. The quantification values of quality control samples fulfilled all 
guideline criteria for bioanalytical validation. The signature peptide with the 
highest quantitative sensitivity was on H-chain VTMLR. From these results, it is 
expected that the pretreatment with TCEP will broaden the application of 
antibody drugs quantification by nSMOL proteolysis.

Di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) is used as a substitute for traditional phthalates, 
in a wide range of applications. However, there is growing concern regarding its 
toxicity. Studies have indicated that DINP is related to thyroid hormone 
disorder and that phthalates can affect thyroid normal function. In this study, 
we aim to determine any effects of DINP exposure on autoimmune thyroid disease 
(AITD), the most common autoimmune disease, and to understand the underlying 
causal mechanism. AITD model Wistar rats were exposed to 0.15 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg 
or 15 mg/kg DINP. We assessed the thyroid globulin antibody levels, Th1/Th2 
balance, histopathological changes and caspase-3 levels in the thyroid. The data 
show that exposure to DINP does indeed aggravate AITD. To explore the underlying 
mechanisms, we examined the levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light 
chain 3 B (LC3B), Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) and the appearance of autophagosomes 
or autolysosomes to assess autophagy in the thyroid. The results show that DINP 
can suppress normal autophagy. We found that DINP induced an exacerbation of 
oxidative stress and the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway, indicating that 
oxidative stress and activation of mTOR may play a key role in these processes. 
Moreover, the activation of mTOR also promoted the expression of IL-17. 
Importantly, blocking oxidative stress with VE or blocking Akt/mTOR with 
rapamycin mitigated the exacerbation of AITD and the suppression of normal 
autophagy. All these results indicate that exposure to DINP, especially high 
doses of DINP, can aggravate oxidative stress and activate the Akt/mTOR pathway. 
This exposure then leads to a suppression of normal autophagy and expression of 
IL-17 in the thyroid, resulting in an eventual exacerbation of AITD.

PURPOSE: Maternal type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) increases the risk of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, but the corresponding mechanism is unclear. This study aims 
to investigate the mechanism underlying the adverse pregnancy outcomes of 
maternal T1DM.
METHODS: Gene expression microarray (GSE51546) was down-loaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus. This dataset included 12 umbilical cord samples from the 
newborns of T1DM mothers (T1DM group, N = six) and non-diabetic mothers (control 
group, N = six).
RESULTS: Consequently, 1051 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found 
between the two groups. The up-regulated DEGs enriched in 30 KEGG pathways. 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DRA enriched in "Type I 
diabetes mellitus". This pathway was strongly related to 14 pathways, most of 
which were associated with diseases. Then, a protein-protein interaction network 
was constructed, and 45 potential key DEGs were identified. The 45 DEGs enriched 
in pathways such as "Rheumatoid arthritis", "Chemokine signaling pathway" and 
"Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction" (e.g. CXCL12 and CCL5). Transcription 
factors (TFs) of key DEGs were predicted, and a TF-DEG regulatory network was 
constructed.
CONCLUSIONS: Some genes (e.g. CXCL12 and CCL5) and their TFs were significantly 
and abnormally regulated in the umbilical cord tissue from the pregnancies of 
T1DM mothers compared to that from non-T1DM mothers.

OBJECTIVES: The incidence and clinical impact of serum autoantibodies in 
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are controversially discussed. The aim of 
the study was to reassess the value of elevated serum autoantibodies in our MS 
study cohort.
MATERIAL & METHODS: In total, 176 MS patients were retrospectively analyzed for 
coexistence and clinical impact of increased serum autoantibody levels.
RESULTS: The 18.8% of the MS cohort showed elevated serum autoantibody levels, 
but only 10.2% of all MS patients were diagnosed with a further autoimmune 
disease (AI). Patients with elevated serum autoantibodies (AABS) were not 
significantly more often diagnosed with a clinical manifest AI as compared to 
patients with negative autoantibodies (P = 0.338). MS patients with disease 
duration of more than 10 years showed no significant increase of positive 
autoantibodies as compared to patients with a more recent disease onset (P = 1). 
MS patients with elevated serum autoantibodies did not exhibit a significantly 
worse disease course (P = 0.428).
CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, elevated serum autoantibodies do not have 
the potential to serve as a prognostic tool for disease severity in patients 
with MS Since MS patients with positive serum AABS did not significantly more 
often suffer from clinical manifest AIs than MS patients with negative serum 
AABS, the role of routine testing of serum AABS in MS patients should be 
critically called into question.

Youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) experience more sleep disturbances and 
shorter sleep durations compared to their healthy peers. Researchers have now 
uncovered the negative mental health and physical health outcomes associated 
with poor sleep in youth with T1D. The field of T1D sleep research currently 
operates under the broad notion that sleep behaviors impact treatment adherence, 
which ultimately lead to worse long-term health outcomes. This model however 
does not explain how behavior influences T1D management and sleep outcomes on a 
day-to-day basis, leading to difficulties in providing tailored treatment 
recommendations. In this review, we present a theoretical framework that 
describes the recursive cycle between sleep behaviors, T1D outcomes, and 
symptoms of negative affect/stress over a 24-hour period. This model is guided 
by the sleep literature, showing a clear relationship between poor sleep and 
negative affect, and the T1D literature demonstrating a link between poor sleep 
and disease management for youth with T1D. Further, emerging literature 
indicates a need for additional parent sleep assessment considering that T1D 
management and fear of hypoglycemia negatively impact parent sleep behaviors. 
Recommendations are provided to move the field toward effective intervention 
studies and new areas of research to evaluate and modify the proposed model.

The thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim is used for the long-term 
treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP patients have an 
increased thrombotic risk, which could be exacerbated if romiplostim increased 
platelet hyperreactivity or caused spontaneous platelet aggregation. To 
investigate this possibility, this study examined platelet function in 
romiplostim-treated ITP patients and healthy subjects. Light transmission 
platelet aggregometry utilizing arachidonic acid, collagen, epinephrine, 
ristocetin, ADP, and saline (to assess spontaneous aggregation) was performed 
for each subject. In addition, the ADP AC50 (ADP concentration that induced 
half-maximal aggregation) was determined for each patient as a sensitive 
measurement of altered platelet reactivity. Fifteen ITP patients and 7 healthy 
subjects entered the study. All ITP patients had active disease and were 
receiving weekly romiplostim as the sole ITP-directed therapy. Platelet 
aggregation in response to the strong agonists arachidonic acid, collagen, and 
ristocetin was not significantly different between ITP patients and healthy 
subjects (P = 0.2442, P = 0.0548, and P = 0.0879, respectively). Platelet 
aggregation in response to weak agonists was significantly reduced in ITP 
patients compared with that in healthy subjects: median (range) aggregation to 
ADP, 45% (15-84%) versus 89% (70-95%) (P = 0.0010), and epinephrine, 21% 
(1.6-90%) versus 88% (79-94%) (P = 0.0085). The median AC50 of ADP was threefold 
higher in ITP patients versus that in healthy subjects (6.3 μM vs 2.1 μM) 
(P = 0.0049). Significant spontaneous aggregation was not observed in any 
patient. Platelets from romiplostim-treated ITP patients do not show evidence 
for spontaneous aggregation or hyperreactivity, but instead have a modestly 
reduced aggregation response to ADP and epinephrine.

OBJECTIVE: Use of patient reported outcomes (PROs) in the routine care of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been shown to improve health outcomes, However, 
integration of PROs into the clinical visit is inconsistent. We aimed to develop 
a "dashboard" for RA patients to display relevant PRO measures for discussion 
during a routine RA clinical visit.
METHODS: Patients (N = 45) and providers (N = 12) were recruited from 
rheumatology clinics at a university center and a safety net hospital. Using a 
human-centered design process involving patients, clinicians, designers, and 
health-IT experts, we performed interviews, clinic observations, and focus 
groups, which subsequently guided an iterative phase of prototype testing.
RESULTS: RA patients and their providers shared the goals of assessing wellbeing 
and developing a personalized treatment plan. We found conflicting views of 
which data were most important for guiding decision-making and for answering the 
patient's overarching question of "Am I OK?"
CONCLUSION: The final dashboard simplified the display of PRO data and 
correlated it longitudinally to the patient's medication regimen. It also 
included laboratory values relevant for RA care.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: By presenting data graphically, the dashboard may provide 
a platform for patients and providers to communicate around PROs and shared 
goals.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate whether five potential functional haplotypes 
of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene and a single-nucleotide polymorphism of 
11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1) are associated with clinical 
outcome in ANCA-associated vasculitis.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis (n = 241) were 
genotyped for five polymorphisms of the GR gene and one polymorphism of the 
HSD11B1 gene. GR gene haplotypes were predicted based on genotyping results. 
Relapse-free survival, mortality, renal survival, metabolic adverse events and 
infections were compared between carriers and non-carriers of GR haplotypes and 
the HSD11B1 genotype.
RESULTS: Carriers of haplotype 4 (ER22/23EK + 9β+TthIII1) of GR had a 
significantly higher 5-year mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR) 4.5 (95% CI 1.6, 
12.8)] and had a higher risk of developing end-stage renal disease [HR 7.4 (95% 
CI 1.9, 28.7)]. Carriers of a minor variant of HSD11B1 more frequently 
experienced relapse [HR 2.5 (95% CI 1.5, 4.1)] except if they also carried 
haplotype 1 (BclI) of GR. Homozygous carriers of haplotype 1 had a higher risk 
of developing dyslipidaemia [HR 4.1 (95% CI 1.8, 9.6)]. The occurrence of 
infections did not differ between GR haplotypes and HSD11B1 genotypes.
CONCLUSION: Haplotypes 1 and 4 of GR and a polymorphism of the HSD11B1 gene were 
associated with clinically relevant inflammatory and metabolic outcomes in 
ANCA-associated vasculitis.

Potential Roles of CD34+ Fibrocytes Masquerading as Orbital Fibroblasts in 
Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy.

Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

CONTEXT: Orbital tissues in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy exhibit particular 
reactivity and undergo characteristic remodeling. Mechanisms underlying these 
changes have remained largely unexplained. Studies have characterized orbital 
connective tissues and derivative fibroblasts to gain insights into local 
manifestations of a systemic autoimmune syndrome.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of PubMed was undertaken for studies 
related to thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), orbital fibroblasts, and 
fibrocytes involved in pathogenesis.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Orbital tissues display marked cellular heterogeneity. 
Fibroblast subsets, putatively derived from multiple precursors, inhabit the 
orbit in TAO. Among them are cells displaying the CD34+CXC chemokine receptor 
4+collagen I+ phenotype, identifying them as fibrocytes, derived from the 
monocyte lineage. Their unique presence in the TAO orbit helps explain the 
tissue reactivity and characteristic remodeling that occurs in the disease. 
Their unanticipated expression of several proteins traditionally thought to be 
thyroid gland specific, including the TSH receptor and thyroglobulin, may 
underlie orbital involvement in Graves disease. Although no currently available 
information unambiguously establishes that CD34+ orbital fibroblasts originate 
from circulating fibrocytes, inferences from animal models of lung disease 
suggest that they derive from bone marrow. Further studies are necessary to 
determine whether fibrocyte abundance and activity in the orbit determine the 
clinical behavior of TAO.
CONCLUSION: Evidence supports a role for fibrocytes in the pathogenesis of TAO. 
Recognition of their presence in the orbit now allows development of therapies 
specifically targeting these cells that ultimately could allow the restoration 
of immune tolerance within the orbit and perhaps systemically.

Most studies of brain iron relied on the effect of the iron on magnetic 
resonance (MR) relaxation properties, such as R2∗, and bulk tissue magnetic 
susceptibility, as measured by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The 
present study exploited the dependence of R2∗ and magnetic susceptibility on 
physical interactions at different length-scales to retrieve information about 
the tissue microenvironment, rather than the iron concentration. We introduce a 
method for the simultaneous analysis of brain tissue magnetic susceptibility and 
R2∗ that aims to isolate those biophysical mechanisms of R2∗ -contrast that are 
associated with the micro- and mesoscopic distribution of iron, referred to as 
the Iron Microstructure Coefficient (IMC). The present study hypothesized that 
changes in the deep gray matter (DGM) magnetic microenvironment associated with 
aging and pathological mechanisms of multiple sclerosis (MS), such as changes of 
the distribution and chemical form of the iron, manifest in quantifiable 
contributions to the IMC. To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed the 
voxel-based association between R2∗ and magnetic susceptibility in different DGM 
regions of 26 patients with multiple sclerosis and 33 age- and sex-matched 
normal controls. Values of the IMC varied significantly between anatomical 
regions, were reduced in the dentate and increased in the caudate of patients 
compared to controls, and decreased with normal aging, most strongly in caudate, 
globus pallidus and putamen.

We sought to investigate the effects of diabetes and hyaluronidase on the 
thickness of the endothelial glycocalyx layer in the mouse retina. In our study, 
the retinal circulation of diabetic Ins2(Akita) mice and their nondiabetic 
littermates were observed via intravital microscopy. The endothelial glycocalyx 
thickness was determined from the infusion of two fluorescently labeled plasma 
markers, one of which was a high molecular weight rhodamine dextran 
(MW = 155,000) excluded from the glycocalyx, and the other a more permeable low 
molecular weight sodium fluorescein (MW = 376). In nondiabetic C57BL/6 mice, the 
glycocalyx thickness also was evaluated prior to and following infusion of 
hyaluronidase, an enzyme that can degrade hyaluronic acid on the endothelial 
surface. A leakage index was used to evaluate the influence of hyaluronidase on 
the transport of the fluorescent tracers from the plasma into the surrounding 
tissue, and plasma samples were obtained to measure levels of circulating 
hyaluronic acid. Both diabetes and hyaluronidase infusion significantly reduced 
the thickness of the glycocalyx in retinal arterioles (but not in venules), and 
hyaluronidase increased retinal microvascular leakage of both fluorescent 
tracers into the surrounding tissue. However, only hyaluronidase infusion (not 
diabetes) increased circulating plasma levels of hyaluronic acid. In summary, 
our findings demonstrate that diabetes and hyaluronidase reduce the thickness of 
the retinal endothelial glycocalyx, in which hyaluronic acid may play a 
significant role in barrier function.

Assessment, Porto Alegre, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the factors associated 
with the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome, both infectious and 
non-infectious, during and after the A(H1N1) influenza pandemic in 2009 and the 
recent Zika virus epidemic in the Americas.
METHOD: Systematic review of literature on factors associated with the 
development of the Guillain-Barré syndrome published between 2007 and 2017 
listed in EBSCO, MEDLINE and LILACS databases. The quality of the studies was 
evaluated using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Thirty-four articles met inclusion criteria and were selected for 
analysis. Their quality was considered good in relation to most of the items 
evaluated. Many aetiological agents had the results of association with 
Guillain-Barré syndrome, among them Campylobacter jejuni, influenza vaccine - 
both pandemic and seasonal vaccines, respiratory infection, gastrointestinal 
infection among others. The aetiological agents found are, in most part, the 
same reported prior to the study period. The association with surgeries, 
chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus and quadrivalent human papillomavirus 
vaccine stand out as new aetiological agents in the list of the various possible 
agents that trigger Guillain-Barré syndrome reported in the study period. There 
were no Brazilian studies identified during this period.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the review reaffirmed C. jejuni as the major trigger 
of GBS, whereas the association of influenza vaccines and GBS is less clear; 
Zika virus infection in association with GBS was found in only one study.

OBJECTIVE: The clinical utility of the multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) 
test for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management in routine care in the United 
States has not been thoroughly studied.
METHODS: Using 2011-2015 Medicare data, we linked each patient with RA to their 
MBDA test result. Initiation of a biologic or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in 
the 6 months following MBDA testing was described. Multivariable adjustment 
evaluated the likelihood of adding or switching biologic/JAK inhibitor, 
controlling for potential confounders. For patients with high MBDA scores who 
added a new RA therapy and were subsequently retested, lack of improvement in 
the MBDA score was evaluated as a predictor of future RA medication failure, 
defined by the necessity to change RA medications again.
RESULTS: Among 60,596 RA patients with MBDA testing, the proportion adding or 
switching biologics/JAK inhibitor among those not already taking a biologic/JAK 
inhibitor was 9.0% (low MBDA), 11.8% (moderate MBDA), and 19.7% (high MBDA, p < 
0.0001). Similarly, among those already taking biologics/JAK inhibitor, the 
proportions were 5.2%, 8.3%, and 13.5% (p < 0.0001). After multivariable 
adjustment, referent to those with low disease MBDA scores, the likelihood of 
switching was 1.51-fold greater (95% CI 1.35-1.69) for patients with moderate 
MBDA scores, and 2.62 (2.26-3.05) for patients with high MBDA scores. Among 
those with high MBDA scores who subsequently added a biologic/JAK inhibitor and 
were retested, lack of improvement in the MBDA score category was associated 
with likelihood of future RA treatment failure (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27-2.03).
CONCLUSION: The MBDA score was associated with both biologic and JAK inhibitor 
medication addition/switching and subsequent treatment outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Joint space narrowing (JSN) is a measurable outcome of tissue 
degeneration in arthritis. JSN is usually assessed by conventional radiography. 
Ultrasonographic (US) measurement of joint cartilage thickness has been 
validated in healthy children, and US measurement of the distal femoral 
cartilage has been validated in a group of patients with juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA). Our aim was to compare the measures of cartilage thickness of 
the proximal cartilage site in the second metacarpophalangeal (MCP), second 
proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and knee joints as assessed by US to joint space 
width (JSW) as measured by computerized radiography in children with JIA.
METHODS: The study included 74 children with JIA aged 5-15 years (median 11.3 
yrs). MCP and PIP joints were assessed at one midline spot. Knee joints were 
assessed at the medial and lateral femoral condylar areas. Only the proximal 
cartilage site in the joints was assessed by US, whereas the complete JSW was 
assessed by radiography.
RESULTS: We assessed 136 second MCP, 138 second PIP, and 146 knee joints. We 
found a high level of agreement between US and radiographic measures of 
cartilage thickness and JSW: r = 0.82-0.86 (second MCP), r = 0.50-0.55 (second 
PIP), and r = 0.52-0.81 (knee); p < 0.001 for all 8 assessed sites.
CONCLUSION: US measurements of cartilage thickness of the proximal site of the 
second MCP, second PIP, and knee joints correlated well with radiographic JSW 
measurements in the finger and knee joints of children with JIA. However, US 
does not measure the distal cartilage, which may limit its use in the assessment 
of JSN.

OBJECTIVE: To determine barriers and facilitators to the uptake of findings from 
the Research in Arthritis in Canadian Children emphasizing Outcomes (ReACCh-Out) 
study into clinical care by pediatric rheumatologists (PR) and allied health 
professionals (AHP) caring for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
in Canada.
METHODS: PR and AHP participated in this qualitative study through telephone 
interviews. Interview guides were developed using the Theoretical Domains 
Framework and focused on the use of information from the ReACCh-Out study in the 
practice of counseling patients and families. A directed content analysis 
approach was used for coding.
RESULTS: Nineteen interviews (8 PR and 11 AHP) were completed. All PR had 
knowledge of the ReACCh-Out study. Three major themes were identified: (1) both 
groups are motivated to use information from research in clinical care; (2) 
volume and emotional effect of information on families are barriers; and (3) 
specific timepoints in care trigger providing this information. AHP had less 
knowledge of the ReACCh-Out study, did not feel it was their primary role to 
provide this information, and have a desire for more opportunity to participate 
in academic forums related to research.
CONCLUSION: We have described a comprehensive overview of the barriers and 
facilitators perceived by healthcare providers in the translation of knowledge 
from JIA research into use in clinical practice. These findings provide a 
foundation for the development of knowledge translation strategies in the care 
of children with JIA and other rheumatic diseases.

AIMS: To estimate type 1 diabetes incidence in children in France and its 
evolution between 2010 and 2015, based on comprehensive medico-administrative 
databases.
METHODS: The algorithm built to identify new cases of type 1 diabetes selected 
children aged between 6 months and 14 years who had at least one hospital stay 
for diabetes, followed by their first insulin treatment, excluding children 
suffering from another form of diabetes. Age and sex specific annual incidence 
rates were estimated and time trend was analyzed using Poisson regression.
RESULTS: A total of 12 067 children were identified as newly diagnosed with type 
1 diabetes and the annual incidence rates increased between 2010 and 2015 (from 
15.4 [95% Confidence Interval: 14.7; 16.1] to 19.1 [18.3; 19.9] per 100 000 
person-years), among boys and girls, and in each age group (4 and under, 5-9, 
10-14 year olds). The annual rate of increase was 4.0% [3.4; 4.6]. This trend 
was not significantly different between each gender, and each age group.
CONCLUSIONS: Valid database information on disease incidence is essential for 
healthcare planning and provides a valuable resource for health research. An 
increase of the incidence rate of type 1 diabetes in children was highlighted in 
both sexes and in all age groups.

Introduction: Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most common cause of a 
nephrotic syndrome in Caucasian adults. The identification of target antigens in 
MN in the last decade has had a major impact on the clinical approach to these 
patients. Areas covered: Since the discoveries in animal models in the 1980s 
that circulating autoantibodies induce disease upon in situ binding to 
glomerular podocytes, many attempts have been undertaken to define the human 
antigens responsible for disease induction. Only in 2009 was Phospholipase A2 
Receptor 1 described as the major antigen responsible for MN onset in about 70% 
of patients. Subsequently, in 2014, Thrombospondin Type-1 Domain-Containing 7A 
was identified as a second antigen, accounting for 2-3% of patients with MN. The 
knowledge of the role of these antibodies in MN has improved the diagnosis and 
management of patients and helped to better define the need for 
immunosuppressive treatment. Expert commentary: These discoveries over the last 
10 years in the discipline of nephrology have clearly shown the improvements a 
better understanding of disease pathogenesis can bring for patient care.

Successful pregnancy in a patient with pulmonary renal syndrome double-positive 
for anti-GBM antibodies and p-ANCA .

Sprenger-Mähr H, Zitt E, Soleiman A, Lhotta K.

BACKGROUND: Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody disease is a 
rare condition causing pulmonary hemorrhage and necrotizing glomerulonephritis 
(pulmonary renal syndrome).
CASE: We report a 30-year-old woman who presented with life-threatening 
pulmonary hemorrhage and an active urinary sediment, with normal glomerular 
filtration rate in the 13th week of pregnancy. Anti-GBM antibodies in serum were 
negative, but perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (p-ANCA) were 
detected. A renal biopsy revealed necrotizing glomerulonephritis with linear IgG 
deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. A diagnosis of pulmonary renal 
syndrome caused by anti-GBM antibodies and p-ANCA (double-positive) was made. 
Plasma exchange was started but had to be changed to immunoadsorption because of 
an allergic reaction to fresh frozen plasma. Oral steroids were introduced. The 
patient also received one dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide followed by two 
1-g doses of rituximab. The patient responded quickly to treatment with 
resolution of pulmonary hemorrhage and urinary abnormalities. The infant was 
delivered in the 38th week of pregnancy by caesarian section. It was small for 
age but otherwise completely healthy with a normal B-cell count.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a double-positive 
pulmonary renal syndrome in pregnancy. Presentation in mid-pregnancy allowed for 
the application of cyclophosphamide without causing malformations and rituximab 
without B-cell depletion in the infant. .

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with unknown 
aetiology. According to the role of interleukin 10 (IL10) in SLE pathogenesis, 
the genetic alterations in its promoter region could be associated with elevated 
IL10 levels and exacerbated disease. Here, we investigated the association of 
genotype and haplotype frequencies of three IL10 gene promoter polymorphisms 
with susceptibility to SLE, IL10 plasma levels and disease activity of patients 
in an Iranian population. A total of 116 SLE patients and 131 healthy subjects 
were enrolled. The PCR-RFLP technique was used to detect IL10 promoter genotypes 
at the positions of -1082 (G/A), -819 (C/T) and -592 (C/A) in association with 
IL10 plasma levels and SLEDAI scores. The GG genotype of -1082 polymorphism was 
associated with the increased risk of SLE [OR = 2.65, 95% CI (1.21-5.82), 
p-value = 0.046]. The CC genotype in -819 region was associated with SLE 
susceptibility [OR = 3.38, 95% CI (1.26-9.07), p-value = 0.034] and C allele was 
introduced as risk allele [OR = 1.86, 95% CI (1.15-3.01), p-value = 0.009] in 
this region. IL10 plasma levels were overexpressed in CC genotype carriers of 
-592 SNP and decreased in AA genotype carriers of -1082. IL10 was also increased 
in SLE patients with CGT (-592/-1082/-819) haplotype. The SLEDAI score was 
higher among CC genotype carriers at the position of -592 and TT genotype 
carriers at the region of -819. SLEDAI was also elevated among patients with CGC 
(-592/-1082/-819) and CAC (p = 0.011) haplotypes. The present study suggests 
that the IL10 -819(C/T), -1082(G/A) and -592(C/A) polymorphisms and the 
haplotypes are associated with SLE susceptibility, increased disease activity 
and elevated IL10 levels. While this is the first time to report such an 
association in an Iranian population, further studies are needed to confirm 
these findings.

PURPOSE: To describe the use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFis) 
among pregnancies ending in a live birth and with a diagnosis of ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 
psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or 
ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: We identified pregnancies among women aged 15 to 54 years between 
01/01/2004 and 09/30/2015 from 16 health plans participating in Sentinel. We 
inferred indication using ICD-9-CM codes in the 183-day period before 
conception. We assessed proportion of infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, 
certolizumab pegol, and golimumab by calendar year, indication, and maternal 
age, and compared them to proportions in an age-matched, indication-matched, and 
date-matched non-pregnant cohort.
RESULTS: Among 19 681 pregnancies with at least one chronic inflammatory 
condition, 2990 (15.2%) received a TNFi. In both pregnancies and matched 
non-pregnant cohort, TNFi use was highest (34.4%; 55.8%) for PsA patients and 
lowest (6.2%; 13.4%) for PsO patients. Etanercept was most frequently used among 
AS/JIA/PsA/PsO/RA patients, while infliximab was the preferred TNFi for CD/UC 
patients. Except for infliximab and certolizumab, TNFi use during pregnancy 
decreased after the first trimester. Pregnancies among older pregnant women 
(45-54 years) were more likely to be treated compared with the matched 
non-pregnant cohort.
CONCLUSION: There was a preference for etanercept among pregnancies with 
AS/JIA/PsA/PsO/RA, despite the availability of other TNFis. Decline in TNFi use 
after the first trimester may be related to the desire to reduce TNFis 
transplacental transfer and to minimize infection risk to the fetus or baby 
associated with live vaccine immunizations after birth.

PURPOSE: Statins represent an effective treatment for hyperlipidaemia. 
Immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM), a form of statin myopathy, has 
recently been described, and is characterized by elevated creatine kinase, 
presence of antibodies against HMG-CoA and no improvement after drug 
discontinuation, even with immunosuppressive treatment. Information on IMNM is 
mainly from case reports and small case series. Therefore, all reported cases of 
IMNM in VigiBase, the WHO global database of individual case safety reports 
(ICSRs) including the underlying reporting patterns, were analysed to 
characterize more detailed this adverse drug reaction.
METHODS: ICSRs of IMNM up to October 1, 2016 were extracted from VigiBase. 
Corresponding case narratives were requested from responsible national 
authorities to maximize the available data. The reports were analysed in terms 
of reporting criteria, co-reported terms, patient demographics, clinical data, 
administered medication, latency time, seriousness of the reaction and outcome.
RESULTS: One hundred one deduplicated ICSRs of IMNM were reported from 17 
countries until October 2016. Approximately two thirds of the cases were from 
the year 2016. Slightly more males than females were affected (52 [57%] males vs 
39 [42%] females). Median reported patient age was 68 years (range 
16 - 87 years). Ninety-one cases (99%) were classified as serious. Median 
latency time was 26 months (range 1 - 288 months). Median creatine kinase value 
was 6860 U/L (range 576 - 35,000 U/L). In total, eight patients (9%) had 
recovered from IMNM. Atorvastatin was the most frequently reported statin in 80% 
of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of IMNM reports has increased in recent years. IMNM 
associated with statin treatment seems to occur worldwide. Most IMNM cases were 
reported with atorvastatin. No dose dependency of statin-associated IMNM 
pathogenesis was identified.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between total and free MPA pharmacokinetic 
(PK) parameters and renal outcome markers, and to verify whether conducting 
therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in lupus nephritis (LN) patients would be of 
value in routine clinical practice.
METHODS: Eighty-four samples were collected from sixteen LN patients. Total and 
free MPA concentrations were measured at predose, 0.5 and 2 h after 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) intake. Area under the concentration time curve from 
0 to 2 h (AUC0-2) and free fraction were calculated.
RESULTS: High between-patient variability was observed (CV% of 53.5% for 
dose-normalized total MPA AUC0-2). A significant but weak correlation between 
dose-normalized total C0 and AUC0-2 was noted (r = 0.5699). Dose-normalized 
total C0 above 2.76 μg/mL·g may indicate patients with eGFR < 81 mL/min with 
sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 75.0%. Hypoalbuminemic LN patients 
demonstrated significantly elevated MPA free fraction when compared with 
patients with serum albumin concentration ≥ 3.5 g/dL (1.49 ± 0.64% vs 
1.08 ± 0.75%).
CONCLUSION: This study examined relationship between free and total 
pharmacokinetic MPA parameters as well as the effect of hypoalbuminemia on MPA 
plasma protein binding in adult LN patients. The study results suggest that TDM 
of MPA in LN seems to be a more reasonable approach than the fixed-dose 
protocol. Moreover, predose total MPA concentration may be a possible estimation 
of MPA exposure, while monitoring free rather than total MPA may be more 
beneficial in hypoalbuminemic patients.

Ghrelin is a circulating peptide hormone, which involved in promoting feeding 
and regulating energy metabolism in human and rodents. Abnormal synovial 
hyperplasia is the most important pathologic hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), which is characterised by tumor-like expansion. Existing studies indicated 
that there may exist some relation between the decreased ghrelin and the 
abnormally proliferating synovial cells in RA. Therefore, the aim of this study 
is to explore the apoptotic effects of ghrelin on MH7A synovial cells in vitro. 
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was 
used to evaluate the effects of ghrelin on the viability of MH7A cells. Terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick-end 
labeling (TUNEL) and flow cytometry were used to test the apoptotic effects of 
ghrelin. At last, Western blot and real-time PCR were performed to explore the 
expression of caspases-8, -9, and -3 after the treatment of ghrelin. MTT 
experiments showed that ghrelin could inhibit viability of MH7A cells. The 
results of flow cytometry and TUNEL showed that ghrelin could induce apoptosis 
of MH7A synovial cells. Western blot showed that expression of 
cleaved-caspases-8, -9, and -3 were increased in ghrelin stimulation group 
compared with the control group, while expression of pro-caspases-8, -9, and -3 
had no significant difference. In mRNA levels, ghrelin can decrease 
pro-caspases-8, -9, and -3 mRNA expression, which confirmed the results of 
protein levels. Then these apoptotic effects were significantly reversed by 
[D-Lys3] GHRP-6 (ghrelin receptor antagonist). This study found that ghrelin can 
induce apoptosis of MH7A cells through caspase signaling pathways.

The development of an end-to-end service solution to support lupus patients and 
improve their experience in clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: To develop an end-to-end clinical trial service to improve patient 
experience during trials, reduce the burden of participating in a trial, and 
increase trial retention.
METHODS: A literature search and stakeholder interviews were used to identify 
current challenges and unmet needs of systemic lupus erythematosus patients and 
other systemic lupus erythematosus clinical trial stakeholders. The results from 
the literature search and interviews were used to create a five-phase map 
describing the current clinical trial experience of all stakeholders. A set of 
proposed solutions were developed to address the identified unmet needs and 
challenges. These solutions were presented to trial-experienced patients and 
study site personnel; any feedback obtained was used to further refine the 
solutions.
RESULTS: Four site personnel and seven patients from three different systemic 
lupus erythematosus clinical trial sites were interviewed between September 2015 
and December 2015. Key unmet needs and challenges were identified at each stage 
of the clinical trials. At the screening stage, some patients incorrectly 
thought they were successfully enrolled into the clinical trial. During 
enrollment, some patients found it difficult to keep fully informed about the 
trial and were unable to explain the trial process to loved ones. During the 
trial, patients struggled to prepare for study visits, felt overwhelmed by the 
trial process, and wanted someone to talk to for support. Clinical trial site 
personnel reported current key challenges as: delivering trial information 
clearly and consistently to patients, setting patient expectations, retaining 
enrolled patients, and providing non-clinical patient support. To address the 
needs of patients and site personnel, an end-to-end support service was 
designed, consisting of nine solutions: My Best Choice, My Eligibility, My Lupus 
Trial Kit, My Lupus Trial Coach, My Appointment Guide, My Clinic Compass, Our 
Gratitude, Building a Different Network, and My Next Chapter.
CONCLUSION: The solutions proposed in this qualitative study may help improve 
the systemic lupus erythematosus clinical trial experience for patients, 
potentially helping to increase trial recruitment and retention. The solutions 
proposed here would also promote positive patient-trial personnel relationships, 
which may help site personnel identify patients at risk of early withdrawal, 
while ensuring that the time and resources of site personnel are used 
efficiently.

Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) affect mainly large- and 
medium-sized arteries. In refractory cases, vascular remodeling progresses and 
leads to serious outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that cytokines such as 
interleukin (IL)-6 play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of TAK and GCA. 
Recently, randomized controlled trials on IL-6 inhibition therapy using 
tocilizumab (TCZ) were performed, and significant effects were exhibited. The 
purposes of conventional treatments have been to improve symptoms and decrease 
the levels of inflammatory markers. Arterial changes have been considered as 
damages. However, after TCZ came into practical use, establishment of treat to 
target is desired to prevent vascular remodeling. In contrast, a combination 
therapy of glucocorticoids (GCs) and TCZ notably increases the risk of 
infections. When TCZ is used, careful attention must be paid to possible 
infections, and dose of GC should be tapered as much as possible. Future tasks 
are to establish indication and dosage of TCZ, indication for discontinuation of 
TCZ due to remission, efficacy of TCZ monotherapy, and protocols of TCZ for 
pediatric cases.

Tocilizumab (TCZ) is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor used for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It was developed in 2008, and its effectiveness is 
supported by evidence from all over the world based on its first decade of use. 
Although the overall efficacy and safety profiles of TCZ are similar to those of 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, TCZ displays certain differences. The 
most notable advantage of TCZ is its usefulness as a monotherapy. Additionally, 
TCZ is favorable in the improvement of systemic inflammatory symptoms such as 
anemia and fatigue. The low immunogenicity of TCZ contributes favorably to 
long-term drug retention. Due to frequent relapse after TCZ cessation, TCZ use 
should be tapered beyond remission. During TCZ therapy, C-reactive protein (CRP) 
is unable to recognize disease activity and the severity of infection. The most 
common adverse events (AEs) are infection and abnormalities in laboratory 
findings including dyslipidemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormality 
of liver enzymes. TCZ obscures the symptoms of infection. Therefore, stealth 
infections without obvious CRP elevation can sometimes cause severe damage to 
patients. Lower intestinal perforation is an uncommon but serious AE in TCZ 
therapy. Further clinical investigations will continue to refine the IL-6 
inhibitory strategy.

BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated neurological 
disease of the central nervous system with a complex and still not fully 
understood aetiology. In recent years, the gut microbiota and fermentative 
metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have received increased 
attention in relation to the development and disease course of MS. This 
systematic review highlights and summarizes the existing literature within this 
field.
METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed was conducted on 12 October 2017, to find 
published original studies on SCFAs and their impact on MS and the animal model 
of MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Furthermore, all studies 
analysing the gut microbiota in MS patients were included. A total of 14 studies 
were eligible for this review.
RESULTS: Short-chain fatty acids have been shown to ameliorate the disease 
course in EAE, but no studies specifically addressing the role of SCFAs in human 
MS patients were identified. However, some investigations have shown that the 
microbiota of MS patients is characterized by a reduction in SCFA-producing 
bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies of EAE in mice suggest that SCFAs may play a role in the 
development and progression of EAE, but so far this has not been confirmed in 
humans. An aberrant gut microbiota in MS patients has been reported to be 
differentially abundant compared with healthy controls, although with little 
consistency in the bacterial taxa. Further investigations are required to 
elucidate the involvement of the gut microbiota and its metabolites, including 
potential beneficial effects of SCFAs, in the development and course of MS.

AIM: Roles of DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in myelin repair were 
investigated in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model 
via its regulation on BDNF.
METHODS: DNA 5hmC level and its limiting enzymes were detected in EAE mice.
RESULTS: Global 5hmC modification, Tet1 and Tet2 significantly decreased in the 
spinal cord tissues of EAE mice. BDNF protein and mRNA decreased and were highly 
associated with BDNF 5hmC. Vitamin C, a Tet co-factor, increased global DNA 5hmC 
and reduced the neurological deficits at least by increasing BDNF 5hmC 
modification and protein levels.
CONCLUSION: Tet protein-mediated 5hmC modifications represent a critical target 
involved in EAE-induced myelin damage. Targeting epigenetic modification may be 
a therapeutic strategy for multiple sclerosis.

Immunoglobulins (Igs) consist of two antigen-binding regions (Fab) and one 
constant region (Fc). Protein A and protein G are bacterial proteins used for 
the purification of IgG by virtue of their high affinities for the Fc fragment. 
Rheumatoid factors are autoantibodies against IgG Fc fragments, which are 
present in the body under physiological conditions. Little is known about the 
influence of Fc-binding proteins on the pathogenicity of antibody-induced 
autoimmune diseases. Pemphigoid diseases are a group of autoimmune subepidermal 
blistering disorders that includes bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane 
pemphigoid. IgGs targeting the non-collagenous NC16A domain of the 180-kDa 
bullous pemphigoid antigen (BP180) are known to induce skin fragility in mice 
and the depletion of BP180 in keratinocytes. In this study, mAb against NC16A in 
combination with Fc-binding proteins was found to enhance BP180 depletion. 
Although mAb against the C-terminus of BP180 does not show pathogenicity in vivo 
or in vitro, mAb treatment with Fc-binding proteins clearly induced skin 
fragility in mice and BP180 depletion in keratinocytes. Anti-BP180 mAbs and 
Fc-binding proteins were colocalized in the cytoplasm and at the basement 
membrane zone. Cell adhesion strengths were decreased in parallel with BP180 
amounts. Clinically, bullous pemphigoid patients had higher rheumatoid factor 
titers than controls. Anti-BP180 mAb in combination with high-titer rheumatoid 
factor serum was found to enhance BP180 depletion. Furthermore, saliva from 
mucous membrane pemphigoid patients contained larger quantities of bacteria and 
Fc-binding proteins than controls. Our results suggest that Fc-binding proteins 
(rheumatoid factor or protein G) may enhance the pathogenicity of autoantibodies 
in pemphigoid diseases. Copyright © 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain

Annexin A2 has been implicated in several immune modulated diseases including 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pannus formation. The most relied treatment option for 
RA pathogenesis is glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids regulate the synthesis, 
phosphorylation and cellular deposition of Annexin A1. This annexin mediates the 
anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids. These two first characterized 
members of annexin superfamily proteins acts reciprocally, one as an 
anti-inflammatory and the other proinflammatory in nature. The possibility of 
these molecules as soluble biomarkers and as an upstream regulator of major 
cytokine devastation at RA microenvironment has not been previously explored. 
Current study elucidates the reciprocal regulation of these two annexins in RA 
pathogenesis. These Annexin A2/A1 and downstream cytokines in RA serum were 
analysed by ELISA. Western blot, Immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation and 
Immunohistochemistry were adapted to analyse these molecules in tissue and 
synovial fibroblasts and also in different experimental conditions. Significant 
increase in the level of Annexin A2 was noticed in naïve RA patients compared to 
controls (14.582 ± 1.766 ng/ml vs. 7.37 ± 1.450 ng/ml; p ≤ 0.001). In remission 
cases significant low levels was detected. On the contrary, significant decrease 
in the level of Annexin A1 was noticed in naïve RA patients compared to healthy 
controls (12.322 ± 2.91 vs. 16.998 ± 4.298 ng/ml; p ≤ 0.001), wherein remission 
cases serum Annexin A1 was significantly high. The knockdown of proinflammatory 
Annexin A2 by siRNA/antibody treatment could mimic the glucocorticoid treatment 
as which induced cellular Annexin A1 and membrane translocation resulting in the 
terminal action. Current data elucidating the regulatory interplay between 
Annexin A2 and Annexin A1 in RA pathogenesis.

OBJECTIVES: A prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled study was 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week course low-dose 
leflunomide combined with prednisone in the induction treatment of proliferative 
lupus nephritis in Chinese patients.
METHOD: Patients (n = 100) with biopsy-proved proliferative lupus nephritis were 
enrolled in this study. They were randomized into two groups and received either 
leflunomide or cyclophosphamide in conjunction with prednisone for 24 weeks. 
Leflunomide was given orally with a loading dose of 40 mg/day for 3 days 
followed by 20 mg/day. Intravenous cyclophosphamide was administered monthly at 
a dosage of 0.8-1.0 g. The primary efficacy outcome was the frequency of 
complete remission and partial remission at week 24. The secondary outcomes 
included changes of urinary protein excretion, serum albumin, complement 3, 
anti-dsDNA antibody level, and systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity 
index (SLEDAI) after 24-week therapy.
RESULTS: Of 100 patients, 48 received leflunomide combined with prednisone and 
other 52 received cyclophosphamide with concomitant prednisone. There were no 
statistically significant differences between groups in complete remission rate 
and partial remission rate. At week 24, 23% of patients in the leflunomide group 
and 27% of patients in the cyclophosphamide group achieved complete remission 
(P = 0.64), while 56% of patients in the leflunomide group and 42% of patients 
in the cyclophosphamide group achieved partial remission at week 24 (P = 0.16). 
SLEDAI, serum albumin, complement 3, anti-dsDNA antibody level, and urinary 
protein excretion improved significantly in both groups. No significant 
difference was seen in the changes of clinical parameters after therapy between 
the two groups. There was no significant difference in side effects in both 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with cyclophosphamide, low-dose leflunomide in combination 
with prednisone showed both effectiveness and safety in the induction therapy of 
proliferative lupus nephritis in Chinese patients.

Since immune complexes (IC) are a direct product of immune response through the 
binding between antigen and antibody, the profile of antigen-associated ICs may 
depend on each autoimmune disease. In this report, we examined the similarity of 
four neurological autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and healthy donors, 
and seven connective tissue diseases based on the profiling of IC-associated 
antigens which were previously or recently identified by immune complexome 
analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum samples. The similarity between 
each pair of two diseases was assessed by correlation coefficients as distance 
matrix with the use of detection frequency (i.e., the percentage of patients who 
were positive for a certain antigen in each disease) of each IC-associated 
antigen in a certain disease. Among 15 pairs of five diseases and healthy 
control examined by the analysis of CSF samples, only 1 pair of neuropsychiatric 
systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis corresponds to the higher 
correlation value (r = 0.73) than 0.7. On the other hand, among seven connective 
tissue diseases examined by the analysis of serum samples, 12 of 21 pairs show 
high correlation value (r > 0.70). Our finding suggested that the profile of 
IC-associated antigens identified by immune complexome analysis of CSF samples 
can be useful for evaluating the similarity of neurological autoimmune diseases; 
however, not by that of serum samples.

Eosinophilia is an uncommon manifestation in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 
there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of eosinophilia with 
disease-related factors. We prospectively evaluated the clinical and 
disease-specific characteristics of RA patients with eosinophilia. Consecutive 
patients with RA with an absolute eosinophil count ≥ 500/mm3 without an apparent 
cause for eosinophilia, were investigated for parasitic infestation. Patients 
with a definite parasitic infestation received targeted therapy, and the rest 
were treated with albendazole empirically. The RA disease-specific 
characteristics of the patients with persistent eosinophilia were compared with 
the patients without eosinophilia. Of the 160 patients with eosinophilia, 30 
patients (19%) had allergic diseases, six patients had bronchiectasis, and one 
patient had hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance. Intestinal 
helminthiasis was found in 34 patients (21%). Eosinophilia was unexplained in 89 
patients (56%) and it resolved after empirical albendazole therapy in about 
two-thirds (58 patients). Thirty-one patients had persistent eosinophilia. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and disease-modifying antirheumatic drug 
modification did not show any effect on eosinophilia. The disease-related 
characteristics were similar between patients with persistent eosinophilia and 
those without eosinophilia. Eosinophilia is due to secondary causes in the 
majority of RA patients, and the most common cause in our setting is an 
intestinal helminthic infection. Persistent eosinophilia in our cohort of RA did 
not indicate a more severe disease phenotype.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We sought to assess the role of coronary artery calcification 
(CAC) and its progression in predicting incident coronary artery disease (CAD) 
in individuals with type 1 diabetes using data from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology 
of Diabetes Complications (EDC) Study.
METHODS: The present study examined 292 participants who had at least one CAC 
measure and were free from CAD at baseline; 181 (62%) had repeat CAC assessments 
4-8 years later and did not develop CAD between the two CAC measures. The HRs of 
incident CAD events were estimated using Cox models in categorised or in 
appropriately transformed CAC scores. C statistics and net reclassification 
improvement (NRI) were used to assess the added predictive value of CAC for 
incident CAD.
RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age of participants was 39.4 years and the mean 
diabetes duration was 29.5 years. There were 76 participants who experienced a 
first incident CAD event over an average follow-up of 10.7 years. At baseline, 
compared with those without CAC (Agatston score = 0), the adjusted HR (95% CI) 
in groups of 1-99, 100-399 and ≥400 was 3.1 (1.6, 6.1), 4.4 (2.0, 9.5) and 4.8 
(1.9, 12.0), respectively. CAC density was inversely associated with incident 
CAD in those with CAC volume ≥100 (HR 0.3 [95% CI 0.1, 0.9]) after adjusting for 
volume score. Among participants with repeated CAC measures, annual CAC 
progression was positively associated with incident CAD after controlling for 
baseline CAC. The HR (95% CI) for above vs below the median annual CAC volume 
progression was 3.2 (1.2, 8.5). When compared with a model that only included 
established risk factors, the addition of CAC improved the predictive ability 
for incident CAD events in the whole group.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: CAC is strongly associated with incident CAD events 
in individuals with type 1 diabetes; its inclusion in CAD risk models may lead 
to improvement in prediction over established risk factors.

The NLRP3 inflammasome senses diabetic metabolites and initiates inflammation 
implicated in diabetic complications and neurodegeneration. No studies have 
investigated NLRP3 in diabetic bladder dysfunction (DBD), despite a high 
clinical prevalence. In vitro, we found that numerous diabetic metabolites 
activate NLRP3 in primary urothelial cells. In vivo, we demonstrate NLRP3 is 
activated in urothelia from a genetic type 1 diabetic mouse (Akita) by week 15. 
We then bred an NLRP3-/- genotype into these mice and found this blocked bladder 
inflammation and cystometric markers of DBD. Analysis of bladder innervation 
established an NLRP3-dependent decrease in overall nerve density and Aδ-fibers 
in the bladder wall along with an increase in C-fiber populations in the 
urothelia, which potentially explains the decreased sense of bladder fullness 
reported by patients and overactivity detected early in DBD. Together, the 
results demonstrate the role of NLRP3 in the genesis of DBD and suggest specific 
NLRP3-mediated neuronal changes can produce specific DBD symptoms.

In recent years there has been a revolution regarding the role of the microbiota 
in different diseases, most of them within the spectrum of inflammatory and 
autoimmune diseases, associated with the development of metagenomics and the 
concept of holobiont, a large organism together with its microbiota. 
Specifically, in Multiple Sclerosis, multiple evidence points to the role of the 
microbiota in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, animal model of the 
disease, and several articles have been published in recent years about 
differences in intestinal microbiota among patients with multiple sclerosis and 
control subjects. We review in this article the concept of holobiont and the gut 
microbiota functions, as well as the evidence accumulated about the role of the 
microbiota in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis. 
Nowadays, there is a lot of evidence showing the role of the microbiota in the 
genesis, prevention and treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 
based mainly on three immunological pillars, the Th1-Th17 / Th2 balance, the 
Treg cells and the humoral immunity. It is also well documented that there are 
differences in the microbiota of patients with MS that are associated with a 
different expression of genes related to inflammation.

Large meta-analyses of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility in European 
(EUR) and East Asian (EAS) populations have identified >100 RA risk loci, but 
genome-wide studies of RA in African-Americans (AAs) are absent. To address this 
disparity, we performed an analysis of 916 AA RA patients and 1392 controls and 
aggregated our data with genotyping data from >100 000 EUR and Asian RA patients 
and controls. We identified two novel risk loci that appear to be specific to 
AAs: GPC5 and RBFOX1 (PAA < 5 × 10-9). Most RA risk loci are shared across 
different ethnicities, but among discordant loci, we observed strong enrichment 
of variants having large effect sizes. We found strong evidence of effect 
concordance for only 3 of the 21 largest effect index variants in EURs. We used 
the trans-ethnic fine-mapping algorithm PAINTOR3 to prioritize risk variants in 
>90 RA risk loci. Addition of AA data to those of EUR and EAS descent enabled 
identification of seven novel high-confidence candidate pathogenic variants 
(defined by posterior probability > 0.8). In summary, our trans-ethnic analyses 
are the first to include AAs, identified several new RA risk loci and point to 
candidate pathogenic variants that may underlie this common autoimmune disease. 
These findings may lead to better ways to diagnose or stratify treatment 
approaches in RA.

OBJECTIVES: This study validates the caregiver-rated Pediatric Acute-onset 
Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) Global Impairment Score (GIS), a single-item, 
0-100 scale, for use in PANS.
METHODS: We collected longitudinal data from community patients meeting PANS 
criteria. We included 128 patients with 1926 GISs, each from a unique clinic 
visit. To assess discriminant validity, we compared GISs from patients with PANS 
with scores from a population of healthy controls. To evaluate external 
validity, we compared global impairment with a clinician-reported global 
measure-the Child Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)-using the Bland-Altman plots 
and correlation coefficients. Then, we evaluated associations between the PANS 
GIS and symptom-specific disease severity variables by fitting mixed models with 
repeated measures.
RESULTS: The GIS shows excellent discriminant validity, distinguishing patients 
with PANS from healthy controls. The scores on the GIS show an acceptable level 
of agreement with the clinician-reported CGAS. The regression line in the 
Bland-Altman plot had a positive slope, indicating that parents tend to report 
higher disease severity than clinicians at higher levels of disease severity. 
Correlation was higher during disease remissions than during disease flares 
(r = -0.69 vs. r = -0.48). All disease severity scales predicted GIS in the 
expected direction.
CONCLUSION: The GIS has excellent discriminant validity and acceptable construct 
validity.

A genetic variant of the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DL1 (KIR3DL1) has 
been found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Herein, we 
investigated the presence of autoantibodies to KIR3DL1 in a cohort of patients 
with SLE. We tested sera from 28 patients with SLE, 11 patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and 17 healthy control subjects for anti-KIR3DL1 activity by an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant KIR3DL1-enhanced 
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and EGFP proteins. Anti-KIR3DL1 antibodies were 
detected in 22 (79%) of the 28 patients with SLE, whereas they were present in 
only three (27%) of the 11 patients with RA examined. Notably, 10 (91%) of the 
11 samples from patients with SLE prior to therapy had anti-KIR3DL1 antibodies. 
None of the samples from healthy donors were positive for the antibodies. Here, 
we report the presence of anti-KIR3DL1 antibodies in the sera of patients with 
SLE for the first time. Anti-KIR3DL1 autoantibodies may be involved in the 
pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy 
with a worldwide incidence of 0.81-1.89 per 100 000 person-years. In Europe and 
North America only 5% of patients with GBS have axonal subtypes, which in South 
America and Asia account for 30%-47% of cases. The aim of our study is to assess 
the annual incidence and clinical features of GBS in La Spezia area in Italy. A 
retrospective (from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2011) followed by a 
prospective (from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015) analysis was carried out 
on patients admitted to La Spezia hospital who fulfilled the GBS diagnostic 
criteria. A total of 86 patients (58 men), mean age of 62.7 years (range 21-90), 
were included. The mean annual incidence rate was 3/100 000 (range: 
0.9/100 000-5.37/100 000) significantly higher than the European incidence 
(P < 0.001). Forty-seven percent were classified as acute inflammatory 
demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), 35% as acute motor and 
motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMAN-AMSAN), 13% as variant forms, and 5% were 
not defined. AIDP was most common in "Golfo dei Poeti" (50%) and "Val di Magra" 
(63.2%), whereas AMAN/AMSAN prevailed in "Val di Vara" (63.6%) and "Riviera 
Spezzina" (62.5%) (P = 0.024). In La Spezia area GBS incidence (especially the 
AMAN subtype) is significantly higher than the incidence reported in Europe. 
AIDP predominates in the eastern area whereas AMAN/AMSAN in the western, with a 
significantly different incidence rate (P = 0.003). Prospective studies to 
assess possible predisposing environmental factors are needed.

OBJECTIVE: Fluorine MR would benefit greatly from enhancements in 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study examines the sensitivity gain of 19F MR 
that can be practically achieved when moving from 9.4 to 21.1 T.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) at both 
field strengths (B0), as a pure compound, in the form of nanoparticles (NP) as 
employed to study inflammation in vivo, as well as in inflamed tissue. Brains, 
lymph nodes (LNs) and spleens were obtained from mice with experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that had been administered PFCE NPs. All 
samples were measured at both B0 with 2D-RARE and 2D-FLASH using 19F volume 
radiofrequency resonators together. T1 and T2 of PFCE were measured at both B0 
strengths.
RESULTS: Compared to 9.4 T, an SNR gain of > 3 was observed for pure PFCE 
and > 2 for PFCE NPs at 21.1 T using 2D-FLASH. A dependency of 19F T1 and T2 
relaxation on B0 was demonstrated. High spatially resolved 19F MRI of EAE brains 
and LNs at 21.1 T revealed signals not seen at 9.4 T.
DISCUSSION: Enhanced SNR and T1 shortening indicate the potential benefit of in 
vivo 19F MR at higher B0 to study inflammatory processes with greater detail.

People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk for cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Both pharmacological treatment and exercise are suggested in the 
management of CVD risk in RA. This study explored the effects of exercise and 
anti-TNF treatment on CVD risk in RA. Twenty RA patients (70% female, 50 
(10) years) completed a 3-month exercise intervention and 23 RA patients (65% 
female, 54 (15) years) started anti-TNF treatment. Markers of disease activity, 
CVD risk, and vascular function were assessed before and after 3-months of 
intervention/treatment. Both exercise and anti-TNF treatment improved functional 
ability and fatigue, anti-TNF treatment was more successful in improving 
inflammation, disease activity, functional ability and pain. Exercise induced a 
reduction in overall CVD risk and improvement in vascular function, which was 
significantly different from anti-TNF treatment where no such changes were 
found. These findings showed that exercise and anti-TNF had differential effects 
on CVD risk in RA, and should be combined for optimal CVD risk reduction. 
Whereas anti-TNF treatment is likely to impact on CVD risk through reducing the 
systemic inflammatory load, exercise should be recommended to people with RA as 
an effective self-management strategy to reduce CVD risk further. Once RA 
patients have responded successfully to anti-TNF treatment, increasing exercise 
should be encouraged to reduce the risk for CVD. Thus, supporting exercise 
programmes when the disease is controlled, is likely to enhance the uptake and 
the maintenance of exercise, which will result in additional benefits to 
cardiovascular health and wellbeing in people with RA.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are connective 
tissue diseases presenting cardiac complications including different 
arrhythmias, then direct electrocardiographic comparison may be useful in 
everyday clinical decision making. We examined 86 adult SSc patients, 76 with 
SLE and 45 healthy controls. Among other examinations all subjects underwent 
24-h Holter monitoring with time-domain heart rate variability and heart rate 
turbulence evaluation. Patients with various co-existing conditions which might 
markedly influence arrhythmias and autonomic modulation were excluded from 
further analysis (SSc n = 12, SLE n = 6). Finally, 76 SSc and 70 SLE subjects 
were eligible for this study, mean age 51.9 ± 13.1 and 46.5 ± 12.7 years 
(p = 0.11), with median disease duration 6.0 and 8.5 years (p = 0.15), 
respectively. As compared to SLE, patients with SSc were characterised by more 
frequent incidence of various supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. As 
compared to SSc, patients with SLE presented prolonged corrected QT intervals 
and also significant correlations between corrected QT length and heart rate 
variability indices. Both SSc and SLE subjects presented impaired sympathetic 
cardiac autonomic modulation, while indices associated with parasympathetic 
activity in SLE were not diminished. Disease duration was not associated with 
arrhythmias' occurrence (except for ventricular tachycardia in SSc, p = 0.02) 
and also with autonomic function in both groups of patients. Patients with SSc 
and SLE differ in terms of arrhythmias, conduction disturbances and cardiac 
autonomic tone. Regular Holter monitoring should be considered as a part of 
routine evaluation in connective tissue diseases patients, especially in 
systemic sclerosis.

To assess, in a setting close to real life, the efficacy and safety of weekly 
subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ-SC) 162 mg, alone or with a conventional synthetic 
DMARD (csDMARD), in moderate-to-severe RA patients with inadequate response to 
DMARDs or anti-TNFα drugs. This national, multicenter, open-label, phase IIIb 
trial is part of an umbrella study (TOZURA). Patients were treated for 52 weeks 
followed by 8 weeks drug-free to evaluate immunogenicity. The primary end point 
was the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) change from baseline at weeks 2 
and 24. Other efficacy parameters, including sleep quality, and the safety and 
immunogenicity were also assessed up to week 52. Of 288 patients enrolled in 43 
Italian centers, 78.8% received TCZ-SC (86.8% females; mean age 
54.7 ± 12.1 years; mean disease duration 7.8 ± 7.5 years; DMARD-IRs 94.7%). Of 
these, 78.0% completed the 52-week period and 52.0% received concomitant 
methotrexate. TCZ-SC yielded a significant reduction in median CDAI from 
baseline already at week 2, which progressed up to week 24 and remained stable 
thereafter (P < 0.0001 at each time point). A significant, rapid, and sustained 
improvement of the other efficacy variables was also observed. Patients were 
deemed as ready for home administration after a median of 2.0 (range 1-8) 
administrations, with a rate (since the last visit) of 80.6% and 95.5% at weeks 
2 and 52, respectively. TCZ-SC displayed low immunogenicity and no unexpected 
toxicities. TCZ-SC, alone or with a csDMARD, yielded rapid and sustained 
efficacy in DMARD/anti-TNFα-IR RA patients, with acceptable toxicity. Home 
administration seems feasible.

Dysbiosis¸ i.e. changes in microbial composition at a mucosal interface, is 
implicated in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory and autoimmune 
diseases. To assess the composition of the microbial upper respiratory tract 
(URT) community in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), we used 
culture-independent high-throughput methods. In this prospective clinical study, 
nasal swabs were collected from patients with GPA, patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA, disease control), and healthy controls. Nasal bacterial taxa were 
assessed using V3-V4 region 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Staphylococcus aureus, 
Haemophilus influenza, and entero- and rhinoviruses were detected using qPCR. 
Unbiased metagenomic RNA sequencing (UMERS) was performed in a subset of samples 
to determine the relative abundance of bacterial, fungal, and viral species. A 
trend toward reduced microbiome diversity was detected in GPA samples compared 
with healthy controls. The abundance of bacterial taxa and microbial richness 
were significantly decreased in GPA samples compared with RA samples. The 
relative abundance of bacterial families shifted, with increased Planococcaceae 
and decreased Moraxellaceae, Tissierellaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and 
Propionibacteriaceae in GPA and RA. Further, decreased abundance of 
Corynebacteriaceae, and Aerococcaceae was observed in GPA samples. Significantly 
more colonization of S. aureus was seen in the nasal microbiome of GPA compared 
with RA and healthy control samples. H. influenzae colonization was also 
observed in GPA samples. UMERS detected the presence of rhinoviral sequences in 
some GPA samples. Thus, our study uncovered changes in the URT microbial 
composition in patients with GPA and RA, suggesting that both immunosuppression 
and disease background affect the URT microbiome. Complex alterations of 
host-microbiome interactions in the URT could influence chronic endonasal 
inflammation in GPA.

AIM: In the currently available literature there are no works investigating the 
correlation between CCR5-Δ32 polymorphism and dyslipidemia in children with type 
1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Therefore, we have decided to explore the potential 
role played by this polymorphic locus in the incidence of dyslipidemia as an 
important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with T1D.
METHODS: A total of 380 patients with T1D were selected. Patients were divided 
into two groups: 180 patients with diabetic dyslipidemia and 200 controls 
without dyslipidemia. Characterization of CCR5-Δ32 genotypes was analyzed by 
polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression model was used to examine the 
association between CCR5-Δ32 polymorphism and dyslipidemia.
RESULTS: When participants were analyzed according to CCR5-Δ32 polymorphism, Δ32 
carriers presented higher levels of: HbA1c (p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose 
(p < 0.001), LDL (p = 0.02) as well as TG (p = 0.01) and lower levels of HDL 
(p = 0.01) than noncarriers. Moreover, the minor allele Δ32 was more frequent in 
dyslipidemic subjects than controls (p < 0.001) and conferred an increased 
individual risk for dyslipidemia (OR = 2.327; 95% CI = 11.241-4.365; p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study suggest that the CCR5-Δ32 polymorphism is 
associated with elevated plasma lipid levels and the Δ32 allele increases the 
risk of dyslipidemia in patients with T1D. Identification of the functional 
variant underlying these associations may potentially lead to the development of 
a novel and adjunctive approach for the treatment of dyslipidemia and CVD.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVES: Glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease, 
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A 
(IgA) nephropathy, share clinical presentations, yet result from multiple 
biological mechanisms. Challenges to identifying underlying mechanisms, 
biomarkers, and new therapies include the rarity of each diagnosis and slow 
progression, often requiring decades to measure the effectiveness of 
interventions to prevent end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death.
STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Cure Glomerulonephropathy (CureGN) will enroll 2,400 
children and adults with minimal change disease, focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy (including IgA 
vasculitis) and a first diagnostic kidney biopsy within 5 years. Patients with 
ESKD and those with secondary causes of glomerular disease are excluded.
EXPOSURES: Clinical data, including medical history, medications, family 
history, and patient-reported outcomes, are obtained, along with a digital 
archive of kidney biopsy images and blood and urine specimens at study visits 
aligned with clinical care 1 to 4 times per year.
OUTCOMES: Patients are followed up for changes in estimated glomerular 
filtration rate, disease activity, ESKD, and death and for nonrenal 
complications of disease and treatment, including infection, malignancy, 
cardiovascular, and thromboembolic events.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: The study design supports multiple longitudinal analyses 
leveraging the diverse data domains of CureGN and its ancillary program. At 
2,400 patients and an average of 2 years' initial follow-up, CureGN has 80% 
power to detect an HR of 1.4 to 1.9 for proteinuria remission and a mean 
difference of 2.1 to 3.0mL/min/1.73m2 in estimated glomerular filtration rate 
per year.
LIMITATIONS: Current follow-up can only detect large differences in ESKD and 
death outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Study infrastructure will support a broad range of scientific 
approaches to identify mechanistically distinct subgroups, identify accurate 
biomarkers of disease activity and progression, delineate disease-specific 
treatment targets, and inform future therapeutic trials. CureGN is expected to 
be among the largest prospective studies of children and adults with glomerular 
disease, with a broad goal to lessen disease burden and improve outcomes.

Shared decision making (SDM) is central to patient-centered medicine and has the 
potential to improve outcomes for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel 
diseases. We surveyed specialists about their use of SDM in the decision to 
start a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor in pediatric patients. Results were 
compared between those who reported using SDM and those who did not. Of 209 
respondents, 157 (75%) reported using SDM. Physician/practice characteristics 
were similar between users and nonusers. There were no statistically significant 
differences between groups in the components deemed important to the 
decision-making process nor the number of barriers or facilitators to SDM. 
Exploratory analyses suggested that physicians using SDM were more accepting of 
adolescent involvement in the decision-making process. Our results question the 
effectiveness of using reported barriers and facilitators to guide interventions 
to improve use of SDM, and suggest further work is needed to understand the 
adolescent role in decision making.

We examined data and patterns in clinical islet transplant studies registered on 
ClinicalTrials.gov (CTgov) for treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D), with a goal 
of extracting insights to apply in the design of a pluripotent stem cell-derived 
islet therapy. Clinical islet transplantation, as a cell therapy (rather than 
solid organ transplant) is a unique precedent for stem cell-based islet 
therapies. Registration activity shows that the field is not growing 
significantly, and newer registrations suggest that the reasons for stagnation 
include need for a more optimal site of infusion/transplantation, and especially 
a need for better immune protective strategies to advance a more effective and 
durable therapy for T1D. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2019;8:209&214.

Patients with persistent/chronic immune thrombocytopenia (cITP) have low 
platelet counts, increased risk of bleeding and bruising, and often suffer from 
reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). cITP treatments may either 
improve HRQoL by increasing platelet counts or decrease it because of side 
effects. The open-label EXTEND study (June 2006 to July 2015) evaluated 
long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of eltrombopag (an oral 
thrombopoietin-receptor-agonist) in adults with cITP who completed a previous 
eltrombopag ITP trial. The final results of EXTEND were published and used to 
assess changes in patient-reported HRQoL over time and association between HRQoL 
and platelet response. Four validated HRQoL instruments were administered: 
SF-36v2 including physical component summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary; 
Motivation and Energy Inventory Short Form (MEI-SF); Fatigue Subscale of FACIT 
(FACIT-Fatigue); and FACT-Thrombocytopenia Subscale Six-Item Extract (FACT-Th6). 
For the 302 patients enrolled, median duration of eltrombopag treatment was 2.37 
years. All 4 HRQoL instruments demonstrated positive mean changes from baseline 
over time adjusted for patient baseline characteristics and rescue therapy use, 
and had positive association with platelet response (platelet count ≥30 × 109 
/L; ≥50 × 109 /L; and ≥50 × 109 /L and >2 times baseline). Improvements from 
baseline started within 3 months and persisted through 5 years of treatment for 
FACIT-Fatigue and FACT-Th6 (P <.05 for nearly all time points); through 2.5 
years for SF-36v2 PCS and less consistently for the MEI-SF. In conclusion, in 
addition to eltrombopag increasing platelet counts and reducing 
bleeding/bruising, it also alleviated fatigue, concerns about bleeding and 
bruising, and improved physical function in many patients, especially 
responders.

This study aims to discuss the effect of triptolide (TPL) on rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and the mechanism related to osteoclast precursor (OCP) and 
osteoclast (OC). TNF-transgenic RA mice were treated with different doses of TPL 
by gavage. After the administration was finished, the curative effects were 
evaluated and compared, and the OCP apoptosis rates, the OC number, and the OC 
differentiation ability in vitro were detected. Finally, splenocytes of 
wild-type mice were cultured in vitro and induced to differentiate into OCP, and 
the cell apoptosis rate, cIAP2, and apoptotic effectors expression level were 
detected after cIAP2 overexpression and TPL administration. After TPL 
administration, the RA symptoms in the TPL groups were all better, the apoptosis 
rate of OCP was higher, and the amount of OC in vitro were lower than that in 
the control group (all P < 0.05), and all of the changes in the high-dose group 
were more obvious than the low-dose group. In splenocytes cells cultured in 
vitro, cIAP2 overexpression could decrease the apoptosis rate of OCPs and 
increase the OC number, and TPL treatment could down-regulate the cIAP2 and 
promote OCP apoptosis and OC reduction. In conclusion, TPL could induce OCP 
apoptosis and inhibit OC formation to effectively treat RA by mediating cIAP2 
degradation.

OBJECTIVE: Alterations in the microbiota composition of the gastro-intestinal 
tract are suspected to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of two closely 
related systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases: primary Sjögren's syndrome 
(pSS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our objective was to assess 
whether alterations in gut and oral microbiota compositions are specific for pSS 
and SLE.
METHODS: 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal samples from 
39 pSS patients, 30 SLE patients and 965 individuals from the general 
population, as well as on buccal swab and oral washing samples from the same pSS 
and SLE patients. Alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and relative abundance of 
individual bacteria were used as outcome measures. Multivariate analyses were 
performed to test associations between individual bacteria and disease 
phenotype, taking age, sex, body-mass index, proton-pump inhibitor use and 
sequencing-depth into account as possible confounding factors.
RESULTS: Fecal microbiota composition from pSS and SLE patients differed 
significantly from population controls, but not between pSS and SLE. pSS and SLE 
patients were characterized by lower bacterial richness, lower 
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides 
species in fecal samples compared with population controls. Oral microbiota 
composition differed significantly between pSS patients and SLE patients, which 
could partially be explained by oral dryness in pSS patients.
CONCLUSIONS: pSS and SLE patients share similar alterations in gut microbiota 
composition, distinguishing patients from individuals in the general population, 
while oral microbiota composition shows disease-specific differences between pSS 
and SLE patients.

Female sex is a risk factor for lupus. Sex hormones, sex chromosomes and hormone 
receptors are implicated in the pathogenic pathways in lupus. Estrogen receptor 
alpha (ERα) knockout (KO) mice are used for defining hormone receptor effects in 
lupus. Prior studies of ERα KO in lupus have conflicting results, likely due to 
sex hormone levels, different lupus strains and different ERα KO constructs. Our 
objective was to compare a complete KO of ERα vs. the original functional KO of 
ERα (expressing a short ERα) on disease expression and immune phenotype, while 
controlling sex hormone levels. We studied female lupus prone NZM2410 WT and ERα 
mutant mice. All mice (n = 44) were ovariectomized (OVX) for hormonal control. 
Groups of each genotype were estrogen (E2)-repleted after OVX. We found that 
OVXed NZM mice expressing the truncated ERα (ERα short) had significantly 
reduced nephritis and prolonged survival compared to both wildtype and the 
complete ERαKO (ERα null) mice, but surprisingly only if E2-repleted. ERα null 
mice were not protected regardless of E2 status. We observed significant 
differences in splenic B cells and dendritic cells and a decrease in cDC2 
(CD11b+CD8-) dendritic cells, without a concomitant decrease in cDC1 
(CD11b-CD8a+) cells comparing ERα short to ERα null or WT mice. Our data support 
a protective role for the ERα short protein. ERα short is similar to an 
endogenously expressed ERα variant (ERα46). Modulating its expression/activity 
represents a potential approach for treating female-predominant autoimmune 
diseases.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pathology with net feminine predominance, is 
one of the most complex autoimmune diseases and has major impact on patients' 
life. The aim is to identify patient and disease-related factors associated with 
self-perceived disease severity in female SLE patients. This cross-sectional 
study enrolled 73 women fulfilling the 2012 Systemic Lupus International 
Collaborating Clinic (SLICC) criteria. SLE disease activity was assessed by the 
Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) score and overall damage by the 
SLICC/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) index. Patients' general 
characteristics, associated conditions as well as SLE specific clinical 
involvements and therapeutic principles were also noted. Fatigue was assessed by 
FACIT-fatigue scale. Self-perceived disease severity was assessed using 
numerical rating scales (1-10 NRSs), to evaluate the disease severity at 
inclusion (1-10 NRS now) and worst severity anytime during disease history (1-10 
NRS worst ever). In regard to worst ever lupus severity, 54.8% of patients 
responded with 9 or 10, while none with 1 or 2 even if only 22.9% of the 
patients responded with 7 or more for disease severity at inclusion (1-10 NRS 
now). Women with higher 1-10 NRS now answers had also higher 1-10 NRS worst 
ever, SLAM, SLICC, and FACIT-fatigue scores. They associated more frequently 
anxiety/depression diagnosis, antiphospholipid syndrome, joint involvement as 
well as treatments with corticosteroids. Self-reported disease severity worst 
ever, anxiety/depression diagnosis, fatigue, and the daily dose of 
corticosteroids were independently associated with patients' perception on lupus 
severity at inclusion: OR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.15-3.94) p = 0.017, 6.67 
(1.11-39.97) p = 0.038, 1.10 (1.02-1.19) p = 0.018, and 1.11 (1.02-1.21) 
p = 0.020, respectively. The vast majority of patients identified severe and 
very severe events during their disease history, results that raise awareness of 
burden concerning lupus occurrence in women's life. Self-perceived lupus 
severity is multifactorial, influenced also by factors less considered in the 
SLE management like fatigue and the depression/anxiety disorders, but also by 
the previous patient's experience.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Serum 
autoantibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) are significant 
markers for diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. Induction of immune 
tolerance as therapeutic approach for RA constitutes a current research focal 
point. In this sense, we carried out a phase I clinical trial in RA patients 
with a new therapeutic candidate (called CIGB-814); which induced mechanisms 
associated with restoration of peripheral tolerance in preclinical studies. CIGB 
814 is an altered peptide ligand (APL), derived from a CD4+ T cell epitope of 
human heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60), an autoantigen involved in the pathogenesis 
of RA. Twenty patients with moderate disease activity were included in this open 
label trial. Sequential dose-escalation of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg of CIGB-814 was 
studied. Consecutive groups of six, five, and nine patients received a 
subcutaneous dose weekly of the peptide during the first month and one dose 
monthly during the next 5 months. The peptide was well tolerated and reduced 
disease activity. Here, we reported the quantification of anti-CCP antibodies 
during the treatment with this APL and in the follow-up stage. Anti-CCP 
antibodies were quantified in the plasma from patients by a commercial enzyme 
immunoassay at baseline (T0) and at weeks 28 and 48. Results showed that 
CIGB-814 induced a significant reduction of anti-CCP antibodies. In addition, 
this decrease correlated with clinical improvement in patients assessed by 
Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) criteria. These findings reinforce 
the therapeutic potential of CIGB-814.

Autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) is a complex disease affecting both children and 
adults. Although associated with significant morbidity and mortality, the 
pathophysiology of the disease and its treatment have not been well 
characterized. This study aims to review the medical literature available on 
this rare but clinically significant ailment, to help establish a better 
understanding of its pathophysiology and enumerate the available diagnostic and 
treatment modalities. A literature search was conducted on PubMed using key 
terms related to autoimmune enteropathy and intractable diarrhea, with no 
restrictions on the date of publication or language. We found a total of 98 
reports of AIE published in the form of case reports and case series. The 
evidence reviewed suggests that AIE is a multifaceted disorder that requires a 
high index of suspicion in the appropriate clinical setting to be able to make 
an early diagnosis. Current evidence supports the use of supportive care to 
correct nutritional and metabolic deficiencies, and immunosuppressives and 
immunomodulators as directed therapies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an 
aggressive, but successful curative modality for patients with AIE as part of 
immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome. 
Cumulative clinical experience with management of AIE has allowed improved 
outcomes in transplanted and non-transplanted AIE patients even though morbidity 
and mortality with are still high in patients with this condition. More research 
is needed to further define the role of new therapies for AIE, and a central 
registry with participation of multiple institutions might help share and 
standardize care of patients with this rare but serious condition.

PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are 
known to be associated with small vessel diseases (SVD) and neuroinflammation. 
The purpose was to investigate the relationship between CMBs and WMH in patients 
with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: Thirty-one SLE patients with WMH and 27 SLE patients with normal brain 
MRI were compared. The presence, location, and grading of CMBs were assessed 
using susceptibility-weighted images. WMH volume was quantitatively measured. 
Clinical characteristics and serologic markers were compared. We also performed 
two separate subgroup analyses after (1) dividing WMH into inflammatory lesion 
vs. SVD subgroups and (2) dividing WMH into those with vs. without CMB 
subgroups.
RESULTS: The WMH group showed more frequent CMBs than the normal MR group 
(p < 0.001). The WMH group showed higher SLE disease activity index, longer 
disease duration, and a higher incidence of antiphospholipid syndrome than the 
normal MR group (p = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively). There was a moderate 
correlation between WMH volume and CMB grading (r = 0.49, p = 0.006). Within the 
WMH group, the inflammatory lesion subgroup showed more frequent CMBs and larger 
WMH volume than the SVD subgroup (p < 0.001 and 0.02, respectively). The WMH 
with CMB subgroup had larger WMH volume than the WMH without CMB subgroup 
(p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: In patients with SLE, CMBs could be related to large-volume WMH and 
inflammatory lesions. CMBs along with severe WMH could be used as an imaging 
biomarker of vasculitis in patients with SLE.

Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), a complication of Graves' disease (GD), is typified 
by orbital inflammation, ocular tissue expansion and remodeling and, ultimately, 
fibrosis. Orbital fibroblasts are key effectors of GO pathogenesis exhibiting 
exaggerated inflammatory and fibroproliferative responses to cytokines released 
by infiltrating immune cells. Activated orbital fibroblasts also produce 
inflammatory mediators that contribute to disease progression, facilitate the 
orbital trafficking of monocytes and macrophages, promote differentiation of 
matrix-producing myofibroblasts and stimulate accumulation of a hyaluronan-rich 
stroma, which leads to orbital tissue edema and fibrosis. Proteomic and 
transcriptome profiling of the genomic response of ocular and non-ocular 
fibroblasts to INF-γ and TGF-β1 focused on identification of 
translationally-relevant therapeutic candidates. Induction of plasminogen 
activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, SERPINE1), a clade E member of the serine protease 
inhibitor (SERPIN) gene family and a prominent regulator of the pericellular 
proteolytic microenvironment, was one of the most highly up-regulated proteins 
in INF-γ- or TGF-β1-stimulated GO fibroblasts as well as in severe active GD 
compared to patients without thyroid disease. PAI-1 has multifunctional roles in 
inflammatory and fibrotic processes that impact tissue remodeling, immune cell 
trafficking and survival as well as signaling through several receptor systems. 
This review focuses on the pathophysiology of the GO fibroblast and possible 
targets for effective drug therapy.

14-3-3η protein is a proinflammatory mediator that may represent a novel 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We assessed 
the correlation between changes in serum 14-3-3η levels and changes in clinical 
disease activity measures in RA patients treated with Tofacitinib (TOF). Paired 
serum samples from 35 patients with RA were obtained at baseline and 5 months 
after the initiation of treatment with TOF. The levels of 14-3-3η were measured 
by JOINT stat 14-3-3η ELISA test kits (Augurex Life Sciences Corp.). The cut-off 
was defined as 0.19 ng/ml. 14-3-3η positivity was found in 57% of the patients 
at baseline and in 37% of the patients after 5 months of treatment. Mean ± SD 
baseline 14-3-3η levels [4.92 ± 8.86 ng/ml] were significantly higher 
(p < 0.005) than 14-3-3η levels following treatment [1.97 ± 4.59 ng/ml]. A 
statistically significant improvement (p < 0.001) of CDAI, SDAI, DAS4ESR and 
DAS4CRP was achieved after 5 month of treatment. Decrease in 14-3-3η protein 
levels was highly correlated with improvement in DAS4ESR (r = 0.50, p < 0.01), 
DAS4CRP (r = 0.46, p < 0.01) and ESR (r = 0.36, p = 0.03) and moderately 
correlated with improvement in CDAI (r = 0.32, p = 0.065) and SDAI (r = 0.33, 
p = 0.051). The correlation between decrease in 14-3-3η levels and improvement 
in DAS4ESR remained significant in a partial correlation analysis controlling 
for ESR (r = 0.39, p = 0.02). This study demonstrates that in RA patients who 
were treated with TOF, decrease in 14-3-3η levels is correlated with improvement 
in clinical disease activity parameters. The 14-3-3η protein may serve as an 
objective biomarker for monitoring of TOF therapy response.

NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? What is the role of 
the long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), which is 
up-regulated in injured podocytes and membranous nephropathy, in the 
pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy? What is the main finding and its 
importance? XIST was up-regulated in kidney tissue with membranous nephropathy 
and in injured podocytes. Down-regulation of XIST inhibited podocyte apoptosis. 
XIST negatively regulated miR-217, and miR-217 modulated Toll-like receptor 4. 
Inhibition of XIST suppressed podocyte apoptosis induced by angiotensin II via 
miR-217.
ABSTRACT: Membranous nephropathy is often characterized by glomerular podocyte 
injury. Up-regulation of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific 
transcript (XIST) has been verified in membranous nephropathy and in injured 
podocytes. Here the role of XIST in podocyte injury and membranous nephropathy 
was explored. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot were performed to 
detect the expression of XIST and miR-217, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
protein, respectively. Podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with flow cytometry. 
Interaction between XIST and miR-217 was analysed by RNA immunoprecipitation and 
RNA pull-down assay. A dual luciferase reporter assay was used to examine the 
interplay between miR-217 and TLR4. Up-regulation of the lncRNA XIST and 
angiotensin II (Ang II) and kidney and podocyte injury were indicated in kidney 
tissue of patients with membranous nephropathy. Increase of XIST and apoptosis 
were induced by Ang II in podocytes. Down-regulation of XIST reversed podocyte 
apoptosis induced by Ang II. MiR-217 was negatively regulated by XIST. MiR-217 
controlled TLR4 by targeting its 3'-untranslated region. XIST modulated TLR4 
through miR-217 and inhibition of XIST reduced podocyte apoptosis induced by Ang 
II via regulating miR-217. Down-regulation of XIST ameliorates podocyte 
apoptosis via the miR-217-TLR4 pathway, which may improve membranous 
nephropathy.

Long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis with natalizumab (NTZ) carries the 
risk of a devastating complication in the form of an encephalopathy caused by a 
reactivation of a latent John Cunningham virus infection (progressive multifocal 
leucoencephalopathy, PML). Early diagnosis is associated with considerably 
better prognosis. Quantitative EEG as an objective, rater-independent technique 
provides high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (82%) for the diagnosis of 
NTZ-PML. Combination of diagnostic modalities addressing static morphological 
(brain MRI) as well as functional (EEG) pathologic changes may improve risk 
management programmes.

To estimate biologic influence on heart failure (HF) risk in rheumatoid 
arthritis. Retrospective cohort (RECORD Study of Italian Society for 
Rheumatology) study on administrative healthcare databases. We identified 2527 
patients treated with either etanercept (n = 1690) or abatacept (n = 837). HF 
incidence rate was higher in the abatacept cohort than in the etanercept cohort 
with a 2.38 (95% CI 1.08-5.27) crude competing risk HR (SHR) for abatacept of 
developing HF, not confirmed after adjustment for prespecified confounders (SHR 
1.43; 95% CI 0.51-3.98). Abatacept, compared to etanercept, is prescribed to 
patients with a worse cardiovascular profile but does not increase the risk of 
developing HF, when confounding factors are accounted for.

Our aim was to appraise publications from Bulgaria, to assess their global 
impact, and to describe features and challenges unique to the rheumatology 
practice in Bulgaria characterized by stringent cost constraints. The Scopus 
database was queried on 25th July 2018 and data on the number of published 
documents, their Hirsch-indices and citations number were extracted. Published 
Bulgarian guidelines for the management of rheumatic diseases and the presented 
data on Bulgarian Rheumatology Society were identified based on prior knowledge 
of the authors. From all the identified 1082 document the most extensively 
researched areas were rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE), osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis (OA). For the last five years (from Jan 
2013 to 25th July 2018) the number of publications was 293. We found that 
Bulgaria's international scientific collaboration in the field of rheumatology 
is focused on a handful of countries mainly from Europe. Although Bulgarian 
rheumatologists have access to costly biologic agents for treating their 
patients with rheumatic diseases, their funding may not be granted according to 
the current recommendations of European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 
national guidelines for the management of rheumatic diseases. Although the 
western world clearly dominates the production of scientific publications in 
rheumatology, Bulgarian rheumatology may present another perspective for 
diagnosis and management of patients with rheumatic diseases in a cost-stringent 
environment. Nevertheless, both rheumatology science and practice in Bulgaria 
still have a long way to go to take its deserved place among the other European 
countries.

INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is increasing 
worldwide. Care provided appears to have an influence on the course of disease. 
The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of T1DM and to collect 
data on the resources and care used in Asturias.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study including patients 
born between 2000 and 2014 with diagnosis of T1DM at 31/12/2014. Patients were 
identified using two independent data sources. Information was collected from 
medical records. A descriptive data analysis was performed to provide frequency 
distributions and measures of position and dispersion.
RESULTS: 146 patients were identified, with a total prevalence of 1.25/1.000 
children. Prevalence rates by age group were 0.21, 1.15, and 2.40 by 1000 in 
children aged 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years respectively. Autoimmune thyroid 
disorders and celiac disease were found in 8.2% and 6.8% respectively, while 
14.4% had a family history of T1DM and 29.4% of T2DM. Ninety-two children were 
treated by pediatricians and 34 by endocrinologists. All children were receiving 
multiple dose insulin treatment and none of them used self-monitoring blood 
glucose systems. Health education was provided to 37.7% of children.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the first data on T1DM prevalence in children 
under 15 years old in Asturias and provides care data that show the disparity in 
care received depending on healthcare area.

Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) play a key role in the 
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was aimed to investigate 
the effects of miR-3926 on the biological activities of RASFs. The results 
showed that miR-3926 was significantly down-regulated in RASFs and RA synovial 
tissue. Overexpression of miR-3926 significantly inhibited RASFs proliferation 
and decreased the secretion of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β and 
IL-6 in RASFs. TLR5 was identified to be a direct target of miR-3926. TLR5 
showed an opposite expression trends with miR-3926 in RASFs and RA synovial 
tissue. Overexpression of miR-3926 led to a reduction of endogenous TLR5 in 
RASFs, whereas down-regulation of miR-3926 increased TLR5 expression. Knocking 
down of TLR5 significantly inhibited RASFs proliferation and inflammatory 
cytokines secretion. Rescue experiments with a miR-3926-resistant variant of 
TLR5 showed that overexpression of TLR5 restored RASFs proliferation and 
inflammatory cytokines secretion in miR-3926-overexpressing RASFs. In 
conclusion, miR-3926 is downregulated in RA synovial tissues and its 
overexpression caused the inhibitory effects on RASF proliferation and 
inflammatory cytokines secretion by targeting TLR5. The miR-3926/TLR5 pathway 
may represent a novel target for prevention and treatment of RA.

OBJECTIVES: Investigate whether asymmetrical corticospinal excitability exists 
in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its association with MS symptoms.
METHODS: Bilateral resting and active motor thresholds (RMT, AMT) were gathered 
using transcranial magnetic stimulation among 82 MS patients. Corticospinal 
excitability (CSE) asymmetry was expressed as the ratio between weaker and 
stronger sides' RMT and AMT. Stronger and weaker side was determined by pinch 
and grip strength. We examined whether CSE asymmetry predicted symptoms.
RESULTS: AMT asymmetry ratio revealed atypical CSE asymmetry whereby the 
hemisphere associated with the weaker hand was more excitable in early MS. After 
controlling for MS disease demographics, shifting of CSE asymmetry towards 
greater excitability in the stronger side significantly predicted more severe 
symptoms including Expanded Disease Severity Scale, nine-hole peg test, 
cognitive processing speed, walking speed, heat sensitivity, fatigue, and 
subjective impact of MS.
CONCLUSION: CSE asymmetry significantly predicted the severity of MS-related 
physical and objective cognitive symptoms. The phenomenon may be related to 
neuroinflammation-mediated hyperexcitability. Shifting of asymmetry toward less 
excitability on the weaker side may suggest the onset of a more 
neurodegenerative phase of the disease.
SIGNIFICANCE: Shifting of hemispheric excitability, detected using a CSE 
asymmetry ratio, may be a useful biomarker to track disease progression and 
understand the benefits of treatments.

Introduction: Even though our understanding of the antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS) has improved tremendously over the last decades, we are still not in a 
position to replace symptomatic anticoagulation by pathogenesis based causal 
treatments. Areas covered: Recent years have provided further insights into 
pathogenetically relevant mechanisms. These include a differentiation of 
pathogenic subtypes of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), novel mechanisms 
modulating disease activity, for example, extracellular vesicles and microRNA, 
and novel players in pathogenesis, for example, neutrophils and neutrophil 
extracellular traps (NETs). Expert commentary: It is evident that aPL induce a 
proinflammatory and procoagulant state and recent data suggest that different 
aPL species activate different signaling pathways which sometimes converge into 
a common cellular response. This implies that presence of more than one aPL 
species may disproportionally increase the risk for the major manifestations of 
APS, that is, thrombosis and fetal loss. Further delineation of the pathogenic 
mechanisms will hopefully provide clues to causal rather than symptomatic 
treatments of APS.

OBJECTIVES: The overall distribution of disease courses in multiple sclerosis 
(MS) is well established, but little is known about the distribution among 
familial MS cases. We examine the frequency of the different MS courses among 
familial and sporadic MS cases and determine whether MS cases within the same 
family had the same age at diagnosis and have experienced the same disease 
course.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a nationwide register study, based on data from 
the Danish MS Registry, the Danish Civil Registration System, and the Danish 
National Patient Registry. The main variables are MS diagnosis, MS course, and 
first-degree relatives with MS The statistical analyses were carried out using 
logistic regression analysis, Kappa coefficient, and intraclass correlations 
coefficient.
RESULTS: In total, 7402 MS cases were included in the study, of which 531 have 
an affected first-degree relatives, and 6871 are sporadic. We found that 
relapsing-remitting MS including secondary progressive MS was more common among 
familial MS cases than among sporadic MS cases (Odds ratio = 1.64, 95% CI: 
1.20-2.24, P = 0.002). We subsequently analyzed data on 133 MS families and 
found that MS courses correlate between the first and the second MS case 
diagnosed, while age at diagnosis does not.
CONCLUSION: Familial MS cases are more likely to have relapsing-remitting MS 
than a progressive course compared to sporadic MS cases. Secondly, we find that 
within MS families, first-degree relatives are likely to have the same MS 
course, but we do not find that they are diagnosed at the same age.

OBJECTIVE: Golimumab immunogenicity was extensively studied during clinical 
development. As anti-drug antibody (ADA) detection with the standard bridging 
EIA (original-EIA) can yield false-negative results or underestimate ADA 
incidence and titres due to drug interference, a more sensitive assay was needed 
to determine clinical impact.
METHODS: A highly sensitive drug-tolerant EIA (DT-EIA) was developed and 
cross-validated against the original-EIA. Samples from phase-3 subcutaneous 
golimumab rheumatological trials (GO-FORWARD-rheumatoid arthritis, 
GO-REVEAL-psoriatic arthritis, GO-RAISE-ankylosing spondylitis) were then 
retested. Associations between ADAs and golimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy and 
safety were assessed.
RESULTS: The DT-EIA was more sensitive than the original-EIA and capable of 
detecting ADAs amid golimumab concentrations far exceeding those in 
immunogenicity test samples. Consequently, an 8-fold increase in the incidence 
of ADAs was observed with the DT-EIA (31.7%) vs original-EIA (4.1%) in the 
studies. Most ADA-positive patients identified by the DT-EIA had lower antibody 
titres, while most with higher titres were previously identified as ADA-positive 
by the original-EIA. With the DT-EIA, ADA-positive patients generally had lower 
trough serum golimumab concentrations than ADA-negative patients; however, ADA 
impact on serum golimumab concentrations was more notable at higher ADA titres 
(⩾100). No impact of ADAs on clinical efficacy or injection-site reactions was 
evident.
CONCLUSION: ADA incidence was expectedly higher using the DT-EIA vs 
original-EIA; newly detected ADAs were characterized mostly by low titres, with 
no impact on clinical efficacy or injection-site reactions, consistent with 
previously observed original-EIA results. Golimumab immunogenicity with the 
DT-EIA is consistent with existing knowledge regarding the clinical relevance of 
ADAs detected with the original-EIA in patients with rheumatological disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Adalimumab (ADA) has become a valuable treatment option for juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The importance of combination with methotrexate 
(MTX) is unclear.
METHOD: Data from the German Biologics in Paediatric Rheumatology (BIKER) 
registry are reported. Response to treatment was analysed using JIA American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores, 10-joint Juvenile Arthritis Disease 
Activity Score (JADAS10), and improvement of functional status and ACR inactive 
disease criteria. Compa-risons between rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) provided data for the safety assessment.
RESULTS: Overall, 584 patients with non-systemic JIA started ADA therapy, 61% of 
whom received concomitant MTX treatment at baseline. The latter patients were 
younger (p < 0.001), with shorter disease duration (p = 0.001), more frequently 
had antinuclear antibodies (p = 0.04), and had higher baseline JADAS10 scores 
(p = 0.03). In patients with ADA monotherapy, enthesitis-related arthritis 
(p = 0.004) and presence of human leucocyte antigen-B27 (p = 0.008) were 
documented more often. Mean treatment duration in both cohorts was 15 months. 
Comparable last follow-up rates for JIA ACR 30/50/70/90% response, JADAS minimal 
disease activity, JADAS remission, and ACR inactive disease were, respectively, 
75/72/64/49%, 66%, 46%, and 58% for ADA monotherapy, and 77/72/61/45%, 64%, 48%, 
and 55%, for ADA + MTX. During 1082 patient-years (PY) of ADA exposure, 725 AEs 
(67/100 PY), including 57 SAEs (5.3/100 PY), were reported. Serious infections 
were reported in 10 patients (0.9/100 PY) and 11 (1.0/100 PY) had varicella 
infections/zoster reactivation. Rates of AEs, SAEs, infectious events, and 
serious infections did not differ between the cohorts. Elevated transaminases 
(p = 0.005) and gastrointestinal events (p < 0.0001) were reported more often in 
the combination cohort. Two pregnancies and no deaths were reported.
CONCLUSION: ADA demonstrated an acceptable risk profile and high percentages of 
patients in both cohorts showed sufficient treatment response. No differences in 
treatment response or adherence to treatment were found.

Interactions between platelets and leukocytes in pathogenesis of multiple 
sclerosis.

Dziedzic A(1), Bijak M(1).

Protection, University of Lodz, Poland.

Neurodegenerative diseases are an increasing problem in the modern world. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major human demyelinating and degenerative disease 
of the central nervous system (CNS). There are many reports that point to the 
significant role of platelet-leukocyte interaction in neurodegenerative diseases 
and cardiovascular disturbances. Epidemiological studies confirm the high risk 
of cardiovascular diseases in patients with MS. The pathophysiology mechanisms 
of this multi-component disease are very complex and involve various types of 
cells. There is increasing evidence that some co-stimulatory pathways affect the 
function of inflammatory cells, both in the periphery and in the CNS. 
Interactions of leukocytes and endothelial cells (ECs) could be significantly 
modulated in the presence of activated blood platelets. The supposed role of 
activated platelets in the development of vessel inflammatory response is due to 
their ability to adhere to inflamed ECs or proteins included in the 
subendothelial layer of the blood vessel wall, as well as to the ability of 
platelets to form aggregates with leukocytes. Blood platelets are able to 
directly activate leukocytes through a receptor-dependent mechanism or, 
indirectly, by biologically active compounds secreted from their granules. 
Cell-cell interactions provide critical mechanisms by which platelets link 
thrombosis, inflammation and related processes, such as diapedesis and leukocyte 
infiltration, to the affected vessel. Determining the relationship between 
platelet-leukocyte interactions and the development of neuroinflammation in the 
course of MS may provide new therapeutic targets in the future.

associated with renal involvement.
METHODS: Four hundred and thrity-four pSS patients from the Rheumatology 
Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from 
2013 to 2017 were included in a cross-sectional study. Patients with renal 
involvement were compared with their age- and gender-matched controls (pSS 
without renal involvement). Demographic, clinical, histological, nephritic, 
immunological features of renal involvement in pSS were systematically analyzed. 
Possible factors related to renal involvement were identified using multivariate 
logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two pSS patients (88.48%) with renal involvement 
were women with mean age of nearly 58 years and mean disease duration of above 
4 years. Clinical manifestation, serologic and immunological features and renal 
biopsy class of the pSS patients with renal involvement were presented. By 
multivariate analyses, xerophthalmia, histological positivity for lower salivary 
gland biopsy (LSGB), anti-SSA/Ro52-positive, reduced complement 3 (C3) levels, 
hypoalbuminemia and anemia retained significant association with renal 
involvement in pSS (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In addition to LSGB pattern, anti-SSA/Ro52-positivity, reduced C3 
levels, hypoalbuminemia and anemia, also indicate significant association with 
renal involvement in pSS. Therefore, early vigilance is required for patients 
with these clinical manifestations.

In placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trials, the presence 
of placebo responders reduces the effect size for comparison of the active drug 
group with the placebo group. An attempt to resolve this problem is to use the 
sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD). Although there are SPCDs with 
dichotomous or continuous outcomes, an SPCD with negative binomial outcomes-with 
which investigators deal eg, in clinical trials involving multiple sclerosis, 
where the investigators are still concerned about the presence of placebo 
responders-has not yet been discussed. In this article, we propose a simple test 
for the treatment effect in clinical trials with an SPCD and negative binomial 
outcomes. Through simulations, we show that the analysis method achieves the 
nominal type I error rate and power, whereas the sample size calculation 
provides the sample size with adequate power accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between maternal use of vitamin D and 
omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) supplements during pregnancy and risk of islet 
autoimmunity (IA) in the offspring.
METHODS: The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study 
is prospectively following 8676 children with increased genetic risk for type 1 
diabetes in Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United States. Blood samples were 
collected every 3 months between 3 and 48 months of age then every 6 months 
thereafter to determine persistent IA. Duration, frequency, and supplement dose 
during pregnancy were recalled by mothers at 3 to 4 months postpartum. 
Cumulative intakes of supplemental vitamin D and n-3 FAs were analyzed as 
continuous or binary variables. We applied time-to-event analysis to study the 
association between maternal supplement use and IA, adjusting for country, human 
leukocyte antigen-DR-DQ genotype, family history of type 1 diabetes and sex. 
Secondary outcomes included insulin autoantibodies (IAA) or glutamic acid 
decarboxylase (GADA) as the first appearing autoantibody.
RESULTS: As of February 2018, there were 747 (9.0%) children with IA. Vitamin D 
supplement intake during pregnancy (any vs none) was not associated with risk 
for IA (hazard ratio [HR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94, 1.31); 
neither was cumulative vitamin D supplement intake. Supplemental n-3 FA intake 
was similarly not associated with IA risk (HR: 1.19, 95% CI 0.98, 1.45). Similar 
lack of association was observed for either IAA or GADA as the first appearing 
autoantibody.
CONCLUSIONS: The TEDDY cohort showed no evidence of benefit regarding IA risk 
for vitamin D or n-3 FA supplementation during pregnancy.

Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been linked to the progress of a number 
of autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), and its animal model, 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells are 
major players in MS/EAE pathogenesis. It is known that differentiation of T 
cells towards the Th1 phenotype is influenced by various factors including 
miRNAs. The miR-92a shows substantial upregulation in MS; however, little is 
known about its role in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory 
responses. Herein, we investigated the role of miR-92a in the pathogenesis of 
MS, focusing on its potential effects on differentiation of Th1 cells. The 
expression levels of miR-92a were assessed in the spinal cord tissues and 
splenocytes from mice with EAE using real-time RT-PCR. Next, using transfection 
with miR-92a mimic sequences, the potential involvement of miR-92a in Th1 
polarization was investigated by flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, the 
expression levels of miR-92a targets were explored in spinal cord tissues of EAE 
mice. miR-92a expression was enhanced in mouse spinal cord samples at the peak 
of EAE disease. Overexpression of miR-92a in splenocytes led to increased 
differentiation of Th1 cells compared with cells transfected with negative 
control sequences. Enhanced miR-92a expression was accompanied by reduced 
expression TSC1 or DUSP10, predicted miR-92a targets, in EAE spinal cords. Our 
data point to a potential role for miR-92a in neuroinflammatory responses in 
EAE. Our results indicate that miR-92a might affect Th1 differentiation, likely 
due to downregulation of TSC1 and DUSP10.

Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) Study: A Comparison With 
the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes 
Interventions and Complications Study (DCCT/EDIC).

In a recent Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of 
Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study report, mean HbA1c was the 
strongest predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) after age. In DCCT/EDIC, 
mean diabetes duration was 6 years (median 4) at baseline and those with high 
blood pressure or cholesterol were excluded. We now replicate these analyses in 
the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) prospective cohort 
study of childhood-onset (at <17 years of age) type 1 diabetes, with similar age 
(mean 27 years in both studies) but longer diabetes duration (mean 19 years and 
median 18 years) and no CVD risk factor exclusion at baseline. CVD incidence 
(CVD death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, revascularization, angina, or 
ischemic electrocardiogram) was associated with diabetes duration, most recent 
albumin excretion rate (AER), updated mean triglycerides, baseline hypertension, 
baseline LDL cholesterol, and most recent HbA1c Major atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular events (CVD death, MI, or stroke) were associated with diabetes 
duration, most recent AER, baseline systolic blood pressure, baseline smoking, 
and updated mean HbA1c Compared with findings in DCCT/EDIC, traditional risk 
factors similarly predicted CVD; however AER predominates in EDC and HbA1c in 
DCCT/EDIC. Thus, the relative impact of HbA1c and kidney disease in type 1 
diabetes varies according to diabetes duration.

AIMS: Persistent pruritic eruptions (PPEs), presenting with dyskeratotic 
keratinocytes histologically, are characteristic skin rash in patients with 
adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). The lesions may be histologically similar to 
other entities that present with dyskeratosis. In the present study, we compared 
the histopathological features between PPEs and other entities presenting with 
dyskeratosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate whether histopathological findings can be 
used to discriminate among PPEs and other entities presenting with dyskeratotic 
keratinocytes, cutaneous histopathological changes of PPEs associated with AOSD 
(n = 26) were compared with those of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
(n = 16), dermatomyositis (n = 19), and drug eruption (n = 16). Dyskeratosis was 
observed in the upper one-third of the epidermal layer in all 26 PPEs. The rate 
of dyskeratosis for PPEs was higher than that for SLE (18.8%) and 
dermatomyositis (15.8%). In drug eruptions, the dyskeratotic cells were 
distributed in all levels of the epidermis. Variable densities of neutrophils 
were found in the dermis in all PPEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this was a retrospective study conducted at a single 
centre, presentation of dyskeratotic keratinocytes in the upper one-third of the 
epidermal layer is a distinctive histopathological reactive pattern of PPEs. 
This pattern may be a useful histopathological marker for early diagnosis of 
AOSD.

We analysed the impact of older age on the management of immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) in 465 adult patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2017 and followed at our 
institution for a minimum of 12 months. Over a follow-up of 4248 patient-years, 
front-line corticosteroids therapy was required in 334 patients (71·8%), mainly 
(85·3%) within 1 year from diagnosis. Need for first-, second- and third-line 
therapy was comparable in younger and older (age ≥65 years, n = 154) patients. 
Older patients presented more frequently with severe haemorrhages, started 
therapy with a higher platelet count and received lower dose front-line 
corticosteroids; thereafter, they were preferentially treated with mild 
immunosuppressive therapies/thrombopoietin-receptor agonists. Conversely, 
younger patients were more frequently treated with rituximab and splenectomy, 
achieving higher rates of complete responses. Incidence rates of ≥grade 2 
complications were: 2·87 (haemorrhages), 1·55 (infections) and 0·66 (thromboses) 
per 100 patient-years. Older age (P = 0·01) and active haemorrhages at diagnosis 
(P = 0·01) significantly predicted grade ≥2 haemorrhages during follow-up. Older 
age (P = 0·01), male gender (P = 0·01), and thrombopoietin receptor agonist use 
(P = 0·02) were significantly associated with a higher probability of thrombosis 
over time. Older age is a significant driver of diagnostic/therapeutic strategy 
in ITP resulting in different responses and complications rates.

Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a key member of the TGF-β superfamily, 
plays critical roles in various medical conditions. Recently, GDF11 was found to 
suppress the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-κB) signaling pathway and protect against inflammation. This study aimed to 
investigate the role of GDF11 in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
We demonstrated that GDF11 treatment antagonized TNF-α-induced inflammation in 
macrophages. Moreover, GDF11 inhibited the development of arthritis in the 
collagen-induced arthritis and collagen antibody-induced arthritis models. Local 
gene transfer of GDF11 via adeno-associated virus exerted therapeutic effects, 
while local knockdown of GDF11 exaggerated inflammation in our collagen-induced 
arthritis model, as detected by expression levels of inflammatory biomarkers and 
the destruction of joint structures. Additionally, the results from both in 
vitro experiments and luciferase reporter gene mouse experiments implied that 
the NF-κB pathway might play a critical role in the therapeutic effect of GDF11 
in RA. This study presents GDF11 as a potential target for the treatment of 
inflammatory arthritis, including RA.-Li, W., Wang, W., Liu, L., Qu, R., Chen,

OBJECTIVE: To obtain the comprehensive transcriptome profile of human 
citrulline-specific B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Citrulline- and hemagglutinin-specific B cells were sorted by flow 
cytometry using peptide-streptavidin conjugates from the peripheral blood of RA 
patients and healthy individuals. The transcriptome profile of the sorted cells 
was obtained by RNA-sequencing, and expression of key protein molecules was 
evaluated by aptamer-based SOMAscan assay and flow cytometry. The ability of 
these proteins to effect differentiation of osteoclasts and proliferation and 
migration of synoviocytes was examined by in vitro functional assays.
RESULTS: Citrulline-specific B cells, in comparison to citrulline-negative B 
cells, from patients with RA differentially expressed the interleukin-15 
receptor α (IL-15Rα) gene as well as genes related to protein citrullination and 
cyclic AMP signaling. In analyses of an independent cohort of cyclic 
citrullinated peptide-seropositive RA patients, the expression of IL-15Rα 
protein was enriched in citrulline-specific B cells from the patients' 
peripheral blood, and surprisingly, all B cells from RA patients were capable of 
producing the epidermal growth factor ligand amphiregulin (AREG). Production of 
AREG directly led to increased migration and proliferation of fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes, and, in combination with anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, 
led to the increased differentiation of osteoclasts.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document 
the whole transcriptome profile of autoreactive B cells in any autoimmune 
disease. These data identify several genes and pathways that may be targeted by 
repurposing several US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, and could 
serve as the foundation for the comparative assessment of B cell profiles in 
other autoimmune diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and correlates of subclinical myocardial 
inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: RA patients (n = 119) without known cardiovascular disease underwent 
cardiac 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography with computed 
tomography (PET-CT). Myocardial FDG uptake was assessed visually and measured 
quantitatively as the standardized uptake value (SUV). Multivariable linear 
regression was used to assess the associations of patient characteristics with 
myocardial SUVs. A subset of RA patients who had to escalate their 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (n = 8) underwent a second 
FDG PET-CT scan after 6 months, to assess treatment-associated changes in 
myocardial FDG uptake.
RESULTS: Visually assessed FDG uptake was observed in 46 (39%) of the 119 RA 
patients, and 21 patients (18%) had abnormal quantitatively assessed myocardial 
FDG uptake (i.e., mean of the mean SUV [SUVmean ] ≥3.10 units; defined as 2 SD 
above the value in a reference group of 27 non-RA subjects). The SUVmean was 31% 
higher in patients with a Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of ≥10 
(moderate-to-high disease activity) as compared with those with lower CDAI 
scores (low disease activity or remission) (P = 0.005), after adjustment for 
potential confounders. The adjusted SUVmean was 26% lower among those treated 
with a non-tumor necrosis factor-targeted biologic agent compared with those 
treated with conventional (nonbiologic) DMARDs (P = 0.029). In the longitudinal 
substudy, the myocardial SUVmean decreased from 4.50 units to 2.30 units over 6 
months, which paralleled the decrease in the mean CDAI from a score of 23 to a 
score of 12.
CONCLUSION: Subclinical myocardial inflammation is frequent in patients with RA, 
is associated with RA disease activity, and may decrease with RA therapy. Future 
longitudinal studies will be required to assess whether reduction in myocardial 
inflammation will reduce heart failure risk in RA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several studies have aimed to find potential biomarkers 
to simplify the diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy 
(CIDP) and to monitor and predict the disease course. However, reliable markers 
are still lacking. We aimed to investigate whether high-resolution nerve 
ultrasound (HRUS) is suitable for monitoring the long-term clinical course of 
CIDP.
METHODS: Twenty patients fulfilling the definite diagnostic criteria of CIDP 
received clinical examination, evaluation of the INCAT (inflammatory neuropathy 
cause and treatment) overall disability sum score (ODSS) as well as nerve 
conduction studies, and HRUS every 6 months over a median follow-up time of 34 
months. Patients were divided into clinically stable/regressive disease course 
or progressive disease course according to the development of the ODSS.
RESULTS: The intranerve cross-sectional-area (CSA) variability of the nerves of 
the lower extremity increased with disease progression, whereas it remained 
unchanged in patients with a stable or remitting disease course.
CONCLUSION: Nerve ultrasound can be used as a method to objectify the long-term 
disease course in CIDP patients. The intranerve CSA variability is suitable for 
monitoring the clinical course of patients with CIDP.

AIM: To assess for any additive value of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in Japanese 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) depending on calcineurin 
inhibitors (CNIs).
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients with SLE who visited our hospital 
from 2015 to 2016 and were taking prednisolone (PSL) at <20 mg/d and one 
immunosuppressant (IS). Patients were divided into two groups depending on HCQ 
use and the groups were compared for changes in SLE Disease Activity Index 
(SLEDAI), prednisolone (PSL) dose, and cumulative flare rate between patients 
who were treated and not treated with CNI.
RESULTS: Among the 103 patients evaluated, 19 (18.4%) were treated with HCQ. On 
analysis of all patients, SLEDAI, PSL doses, and cumulative flare rate were 
significantly reduced in patients who received HCQ compared to those who did not 
(P = 0.04, P = 0.01, and P = 0.03, respectively). Regarding IS use, we found 
less additive therapeutic effect in CNI users than in users of other ISs in 
terms of reduction in SLEDAI and PSL dose (P = 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of HCQ reduced disease activity, PSL dose, and flares 
in Japanese SLE patients but conferred less additive clinical efficacy when 
added to CNIs.

OBJECTIVES: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) has recently become 
regarded as one of the autoinflammatory syndromes (AIS). However, other AIS, 
such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and Blau syndrome, have been 
initially misdiagnosed as sJIA because of the clinical similarities. Making the 
correct diagnosis in the early stage of these AIS is desirable. Therefore, we 
evaluated serum S100A12 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels to 
determine if they could be biomarkers for differentiating these AIS.
METHOD: Serum S100A12 and VEGF levels were examined in patients with Blau 
syndrome (n = 4), FMF (n = 4), and sJIA (n = 11) in the active and inactive 
phases.
RESULTS: In the active phase, S100A12 levels were significantly higher in 
patients with sJIA and FMF compared with those with Blau syndrome (p < 0.001). 
VEGF levels of patients with sJIA were significantly higher than those of 
patients with others (p = 0.001). In the inactive phase, there was no 
significant difference in VEGF levels. However, colchicine-resistant patients or 
patients without treatment with FMF showed high levels of S100A12 compared with 
others.
CONCLUSIONS: Measuring both serum S100A12 and VEGF levels may be useful for 
differentiating patients with Blau syndrome and FMF from those with sJIA at the 
early stage.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal 
disease worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated safety and efficacy of 
autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (ABM-MNCs) in induced type-1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) rats. However, the effect of ABM-MNCs on urinary 
markers of DN in humans is not well studied. We evaluated the therapeutic effect 
of ABM-MNCs on the urinary markers microalbuminuria (MAU), urinary type-IV 
collagen and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) in T1DM 
patients with and without nephropathy.
METHODS: This prospective open-label pilot study included 15 patients with T1DM, 
who had completed 2 visits within 6 months. Patients were divided into two 
groups according to the presence (DN, n = 7) and absence of nephropathy (T1DM, 
n = 8). ABM-MNCs were injected at each visit as per study protocol. Routine 
laboratory data, diabetes tests (fasting serum C-peptide and insulin, glycated 
hemoglobin, fasting and postprandial glucose), 24-h MAU and urinary type-IV 
collagen were measured at each visit. uNGAL levels were studied before and after 
3 days of ABM-MNCs infusion at each visit.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 29.2 ± 10.4 years, 33% were male, and 27% of 
the overall group had hypertension. MAU was significantly reduced in the overall 
group (- 26.0%, p = 0.037), including in DN (- 83.2%, p = 0.021). A short-term 
significant reduction of uNGAL levels was observed 3 days after ABM-MNCs 
administration during the both the 1st visit (median 13.4 vs. 9.5 ng/ml, 
p = 0.027) and 2nd visit (median 8.8 vs. 6.4 ng/ml, p = 0.042) in both groups. 
However this reduction did not remain significant at the 6-month follow-up. 
Urinary type-IV collagen did not respond significantly to ABM-MNCs infusion.
CONCLUSION: Infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells 
significantly reduced levels of MAU in DN patients. Further studies with larger 
sample size are needed to confirm these observations.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of anti-mutated 
citrullinated vimentin antibodies (a-Sa), anti-citrullinated α-enolase peptide 1 
antibodies (a-CEP-1), anti-filaggrin antibodies (AFAs), heterogeneous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein compies/anti-RA33-antibodies (a-hnRNP/RA33), anti-carbamylated 
protein antibodies (a-CarP), and metalloproteinase (MMPs) activity in patients 
with early inflammatory arthritis (EIA).
METHODS: Seventy-four patients with EIA: 51 diagnosed with RA (rheumatoid 
arthritis) and 23 with UA (undifferentiated arthritis), and 20 healthy 
volunteers were enrolled to the study. Inflammatory markers, rheumatoid factor 
(RF), and antibodies mentioned above were assessed in all patients.
RESULTS: In the EIA group, we observed significantly higher concentration of 
a-CEP-1 (65.8 ± 111.6 RU/mL) than in controls (2.0 ± 0.0 RU/mL). In RF(+) RA 
patients, we observed higher concentration of a-Sa and a-CEP-1 than in other 
groups. A-Sa were positive in 69% of RF(+) RA, 37% of RF(-) RA, 26% of UA 
patients and in 10% of controls. A-CEP-1 were positive in 77% of RF(+) RA 
patients, in 56% of RF(-) RA patients, in 8.7% of UA patients, but they were 
negative in controls. In patients with RF(+) RA, positive a-CarP were present 
statistically significantly more often than in RF (-) RA patients. No 
statistically significant difference in frequency of a-hnRNP/RA33 and AFA 
between RF(+) RA, RF(-) RA, and UA was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a-CEP-1 may help in differentiation 
between RF(-) RA and UA. a-CEP-1 and a-Sa may be useful while diagnosing EIA. 
a-CarP may be used in differentiation of RA RF(-) and UA. However, a follow-up 
study is needed to evaluate the prognostic value of analyzed antibodies.

BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), the most frequent cause of 
primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, is an autoimmune disease with complex 
pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on T cells and summarize knowledge about 
their involvement in pathophysiology and treatment of IgAN METHODS: We reviewed 
the literature for (1) alterations of T cell subpopulations in IgAN, (2) 
experimental and clinical proofs for T cells' participation in IgAN 
pathogenesis, (3) clinical correlations with T cell-associated alterations, and 
(4) influence of drugs used in IgAN therapy on T cell subpopulations.
RESULTS: We found that IgAN is characterized by higher proportions of 
circulatory Th2, Tfh, Th17, Th22 and γδ T cells, but lower Th1 and Treg cells. 
We discuss genetic and epigenetic makeup that may contribute to this 
immunological phenotype. We found that Th2, Th17 and Tfh-type interleukins 
contribute to elevated synthesis of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) and that 
the production of anti-Gd-IgA1 autoantibodies may be stimulated by Tfh cells. We 
described the roles of Th2, Th17, Th22 and Treg cells in the renal injury and 
summarized correlations between T cell-associated alterations and clinical 
features of IgAN (proteinuria, reduced GFR, hematuria). We detailed the impact 
of immunosuppressive drugs on T cell subpopulations and found that the majority 
of drugs have nonoptimal influence on T cells in IgAN patients.
CONCLUSIONS: T cells play an important role in IgAN pathogenesis and are 
correlated with its clinical severity. Clinical trials with the drugs targeting 
the reported alterations of the T-cell compartment are highly desirable.

CONTEXT: Islet transplantation is effective in preventing hypoglycemia in 
patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, it is unknown whether transplanted 
islets regulate plasma glucose concentrations appropriately during and after 
exercise in human islet transplant recipient (ITxs).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of exercise on plasma glucose, insulin, and 
glucagon concentrations in ITxs compared with control subjects (CONs) without 
diabetes.
INTERVENTION: Participants completed two conditions in random order: 45 minutes 
of aerobic exercise (60% VO2peak) and 45 minutes of seated rest. Blood samples 
were drawn at baseline, immediately after exercise or rest, and every 15 minutes 
throughout a 60-minute recovery period. Postexercise (24 hours) interstitial 
glucose was monitored with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).
RESULTS: Twenty-four participants (12 ITxs, 12 CONs) completed the protocol. 
Plasma glucose decreased more over time with exercise in ITxs compared with CONs 
[main effects of treatment (P = 0.019), time (P = 0.001), and group (P = 
0.012)]. Plasma glucose was lower during exercise vs rest in ITxs but not CONs 
[treatment by group interaction (P = 0.028)]. Plasma glucose decreased more 
during exercise than during rest [treatment by time interaction (P = 0.001)]. 
One ITx and one CON experienced plasma glucose concentrations <3.5 mmol/L at the 
end of exercise, both of whom returned above that threshold within 15 minutes. 
Nocturnal CGM glucose <3.5 mmol/L was detected in two CONs but no ITxs.
CONCLUSION: Despite a greater plasma glucose decline during exercise in ITxs, 
hypoglycemia risk was similar during and after exercise in ITxs compared with 
CONs.

BACKGROUND: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a common ascending polyneuropathy 
in adults. It is often associated with preceding viral or diarrhoeal illness 
with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or Campylobacter jejuni. 
Solid organ transplant recipients are more susceptible to opportunistic 
infections with CMV than the general population as a result of immunosuppressive 
therapies to prevent graft rejection. However, reports of GBS are rare in this 
population.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review cases of GBS in renal transplant patients to 
evaluate causative pathogens or triggers, management and associated morbidity 
and mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic search of the MEDLINE database 
uncovering 17 cases of GBS in renal transplant patients in the literature. The 
majority of cases were in males (81%) and patients who received deceased donor 
renal transplants (87%). The mean age was 44.7 years (SD 13). The time between 
transplant and onset of symptoms ranged from 2 days to 10 years 
(Mean = 720 days). GBS was commonly associated with antecedent viral (CMV 12; 
EBV 1) or diarrhoeal (2) illness while two cases were attributed to calcineurin 
inhibitor use. All patients recovered fully or partially after treatment with 
anti-viral or anti-bacterial agents, immunoglobulins, and/or plasma exchange.
CONCLUSION: Cytomegalovirus is the most common trigger for GBS in the post-renal 
transplant setting. Other triggers include campylobacter jejuni and calcineurin 
inhibitors. GBS should be considered in transplant patients presenting with 
weakness or paralysis in order to institute timely management.

Current researches have determined the significance of C-C chemokine receptor 
(CCR)6 expression as either a marker of T helper cells (Th) or an effector 
and regulator of T cell function. However, the roles of CCR6 in the pathogenesis 
of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are unclear. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate the phenotype and functional characteristics of circulating CCR6+ T 
cells in blood from chronic ITP patients and healthy controls. We found that the 
frequency of CCR6+ CD4+ cells was higher in ITP patients than in healthy 
controls. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation induced rapid expansion of CCR6+ CD4+ 
cells in ITP patients. CCR6+ CD4+ cells had a phenotype of activated cells and 
predominantly expressed CD45RO. Forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3) and 
CD25-positive cells were exclusively detected within the CCR6+ CD4+ cells. In 
ITP patients, CCR6+ regulatory T cells (Treg ) were decreased and positively 
correlated with platelet counts and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β plasma 
levels. In contrast to CCR6- counterparts, CCR6+ CD4+ cells produced higher 
levels of interleukin (IL)-17A. The frequency of CCR6+ Th17 was higher in ITP 
patients and positively correlated with IL-17A levels in supernatant. Most 
importantly, CCR6+ CD4+ cell subpopulations, but not CCR6- CD4+ , were closely 
correlated to treatment response of ITP patients. These findings suggest that 
circulating CCR6+ CD4+ cells in ITP patients have characteristics of activated 
memory Th17 phenotype and could be used to monitor disease activity and 
treatment response.

BACKGROUND: CD40 is a costimulatory molecule for B cells, and CD154 is a marker 
of CD4+ T cells activation. CD40-CD154 interaction promotes pro-inflammatory 
cytokines secretion and autoantibodies production. PTPN22 gene encodes LYP 
protein, an inhibitor of T- and B-cell activation. PTPN22 1858C>T polymorphism 
confers rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility. Hence, we evaluate the 
relationship between 1858C>T polymorphism with CD40 and CD154 expression and 
IFN-γ secretion in RA patients.
METHODS: PTPN22 1858C>T polymorphism was genotyped in 315 RA patients and 315 
control subjects (CS) using PCR-RFLP method. Later, we selected only ten 
anti-CCP-positive RA patients, naïve to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
and ten CS, all with known 1858C>T PTPN22 genotype. The CD40 and CD154 membrane 
expressions were determined by flow cytometry in peripheral B and T cells, 
correspondingly.
RESULTS: The B cells percentage and mCD40 expression were similar between RA and 
CS (P > 0.05) and we did not find an association between these variables and the 
1858C>T polymorphism. The CD4+ T cells percentage was higher in RA patients than 
CS (P = 0.003), and in the RA group, the CD4+ T cells percentage and mCD154 
expression were higher in the 1858 T allele carriers (P = 0.008 and P = 0.032, 
respectively). The IFN-γ levels were lower in RA patients carrying the PTPN22 
risk allele (P = 0.032).
CONCLUSION: The PTPN22 1858 T risk allele is associated with increased CD4+ T 
cells percentage and high mCD154 expression in RA patients, which could favor 
the pro-inflammatory cytokine release and the establishment of the inflammatory 
response at the seropositive RA.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused by T cell-mediated destruction 
of pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells. The epitopes recognised by 
pathogenic T cells in human type 1 diabetes are poorly defined; however, a 
growing body of evidence suggests that T cell responses against neoepitopes 
contribute to beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetes. Neoepitopes are formed 
when self-proteins undergo post-translational modification to create a new 
epitope that is recognised by T- or B cells. Here we review the role of human T 
cell responses against neoepitopes in the immune pathogenesis of type 1 
diabetes. Specifically, we review the different approaches to identifying 
neoepitopes relevant to human type 1 diabetes and outline several advances in 
this field that have occurred over the past few years. We also discuss the 
application of neoepitopes to the development of antigen-specific therapies for 
type 1 diabetes and the unresolved challenges that need to be overcome before 
the full repertoire of neoepitopes recognised by pathogenic human T cells in 
type 1 diabetes can be determined. This information may then be used to develop 
antigen-specific therapies for type 1 diabetes and assays to monitor changes in 
pathogenic, beta cell-specific T cell responses.

To investigate the effect of concomitant conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) with adalimumab or infliximab 
on maintaining serum drug and clinical outcomes after the first year of 
treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Second, to assess the 
influence of methotrexate (MTX) dose on these outcomes. Ninety-two patients with 
RA starting infliximab (n = 67) or adalimumab (n = 25) tumor necrosis factor 
inhibitor (TNFi) with available drug levels and clinical improvement assessment 
(European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] response) after 12 months were 
included. Patients were grouped according to concomitant csDMARD use: (i) TNFi 
monotherapy; (ii) TNFi+MTX; (iii) TNFi with csDMARDs other than MTX (TNFi+OD). 
Patients receiving MTX were also classified by dose as < 15 mg/week 
(TNFi+MTX<15) and ≥ 15 mg/week (TNFi+MTX≥15). Logistic regression analyses were 
employed. More TNFi+MTX patients had circulating serum TNFi at 12 months (71% 
TNFi+MTX vs. 20% TNFi+OD vs. 9% TNFi monotherapy). Of these, the probability of 
maintaining serum TNFi levels was twice (OR 2.3; p = 0.06) than that of patients 
without MTX. However, statistically significant results were observed only for 
the highest MTX dose (OR 4.9; p = 0.02). Most patients achieving good EULAR 
response were treated with TNFi+MTX (81%). The probability of achieving this 
response was three times higher in patients within the TNFi+MTX group (OR 3.4; 
p = 0.03); however, no differences were found with regard to MTX dose. The 
persistence of serum TNFi and the probability of achieving clinical response are 
influenced by MTX but not by OD in patients with RA treated with infliximab or 
adalimumab.

The Thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) is the main driver of Graves' disease 
(GD) and its most common extra-thyroidal manifestation: thyroid eye disease 
(TED). Though key to diagnosis, it has not been used routinely as a marker of 
disease activity or to guide treatment. Here we demonstrate, through a 
retrospective review of 105 patients with TED, that serial TRAb levels vary with 
time, correlate with disease activity and are affected by smoking and endocrine 
control. Such serial measurements can guide the modern management of thyroid eye 
disease, helping to prevent the more serious manifestations. We show that 
surgical thyroidectomy is associated with a reduction in antibody levels and a 
reduced rate of TED reactivation when compared to radio-iodine ablation where 
the stimulating antigen is not removed. This provides a molecular explanation 
for epidemiological studies showing radio-ablation being associated with an 
increased risk of orbitopathy. To demonstrate the effect of our clinical 
approach on a patient population, we then compared the incidence and severity of 
TED in a clinic in a period before and after the introduction of serial TRAb 
measurements. Despite an increase in disease incidence and severity at 
presentation over the two-decade study period, our approach saw a significant 
reduction in the need for surgical intervention for this orbital disorder.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) can be 
associated with inflammatory arthritis, which is underdiagnosed by clinical 
examination. The aim of this cross-sectional, observational study was to 
compare, for the first time, the ultrasound (US)-detected joint abnormalities in 
these two diseases and to define the role of US in patient management. 
Participants had SLE (n = 18) and SS (n = 23), symptoms of hand joint pain and 
no previous diagnosis of arthritis. Data on disease activity, duration, damage 
scores, inflammatory and serologic markers, treatment and clinical and 
ultrasound parameters (derived from the assessment of 902 joints) were analysed 
and correlated using descriptive statistics, correlation tests and regression 
models. Subclinical synovitis/tenosynovitis was detected in 44.4% of SLE 
patients and 21.7% of SS patients (p = 0.23). There was no significant 
correlation between either the total Power Doppler score or the total grey-scale 
score and disease activity scores (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index 
and European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's syndrome disease activity 
index). Both damage scores (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics 
index and Sjögren's syndrome disease damage index) correlated with the total 
grey-scale synovitis score. Significant proportions of the participants with SLE 
and SS had erosions (55.6% and 34.8%, respectively, p = 0.184) and osteophytes 
(61.1% vs. 60.9%, p = 0.98) in at least one joint. The lack of correlation 
between disease activity scores and US outcome measures indicated their 
limitations in diagnosing subclinical synovitis in SLE and SS patients. Future 
research is needed to determine if the development of erosions could be 
prevented by early diagnosis and prompt treatment of inflammatory arthritis 
associated with SLE and SS.

Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research 
(PGIMER), Chandigarh, India.

BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the Fcγ-receptor (FcγR) have been associated with 
increased susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There is a 
paucity of data on FcγR expression pattern in pediatric subjects with SLE. The 
aim of the study was to assess the expression of various FcγRs by flow cytometry 
in children with pediatric-onset SLE (pSLE).
METHODS: Thirty-one children aged 0-15 years fulfilling 2012 Systemic Lupus 
International Collaborating Clinics Classification Criteria for SLE were 
enrolled. Disease-active (n = 14) and the inactive group were delineated using 
the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Thirteen age- and sex-matched controls 
were also enrolled. Blood samples of cases and controls were assessed for CD64, 
CD32B and CD16 expression on B lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes by flow 
cytometry using standard techniques. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and 
percentage expression were calculated using the FACS DIVA software and Kaluza 
software.
RESULTS: Median fluorescence intensity and percentage expression of CD64 on 
monocytes (MFI: 1.71 vs 1.51, P = 0.86) and neutrophils (MFI: 0.42 vs 0.64, 
P = 0.3) were comparable between patients and controls. MFIs of CD16 expression 
on neutrophils (3.47 vs 11.4, P = 0.05) and monocytes (1.28 vs 3.45, P = 0.07) 
were lower in patients compared to controls. CD32B expression on lymphocytes 
(MFI: 0.56 vs 1.37; % expression:18.3% vs 12.32%) was also comparable between 
cases and controls. Expression of CD64, CD16, and CD32B were also comparable 
between patients with active and inactive disease.
CONCLUSION: No significant differences were observed in FcγR expression between 
patients and controls. However, the overall trends of FcγR expression and 
decreased CD16 on monocytes and neutrophils are in consonance with data from 
larger cohorts of adult SLE patients.

BACKGROUND: Levels of CCL20 and its CCR6 receptor are elevated in many 
autoimmune diseases which help in the recruitment of T helper (Th17) cells to 
site of inflammation.
OBJECTIVES: Determine the value of single nucleotide polymorphism of CCL20 
(rs6749704) and IL-17F (rs763780) genes and their concomitant effect on the 
serum CCL20 level and susceptibility to MS in Egyptian patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 83 patients and 95 
healthy subjects. Serum levels of CCL20 were measured by ELISA. The DNA was 
analyzed for rs6749704 and rs763780 using Genotyping Taqman assay.
RESULTS: The mean serum levels of CCL20 in the MS group were significantly 
higher than healthy group (P < 0.001). Frequencies of CT genotype of rs6749704 
in CCL20 gene and C allele in MS patients were significantly higher compared to 
controls. Also significant increase of rs763780 in IL-17F gene was detected in 
MS patients. Concomitant polymorphism in both genes in MS patients showed an 
increase risk to MS rather than individual locus.
CONCLUSION: CCL20 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS. Both 
allelic variation of (rs6749704) within CCL20 gene and (rs763780) within IL-17F 
gene can be considered risk factor for development of MS in Egyptian patients.

Dose reduction of biologic therapy in inflammatory arthritis: A qualitative 
study of patients' perceptions and needs.

OBJECTIVE: Successful biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) 
dose reduction appears increasingly possible from clinical trials. The present 
study aimed to understand the patient perspective of bDMARD dose reduction.
METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic 
arthritis who were self-administering subcutaneous bDMARDs therapy at two 
National Health Service trusts participated in semi-structured interviews. To 
capture multiple experiences, patients were purposefully sampled for a range of 
age, gender, disease duration, reducing/not reducing bDMARDs and either within 
3-12 months of bDMARD initiation or ≥12 months and in remission/low disease 
activity. Inductive thematic analysis was utilized.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients were interviewed (six on dose reduction). Five 
overarching themes were identified. When thinking about dose reduction, patients 
reflected on their difficult life before bDMARDs ("Where I was then") compared 
with their transformative effects ("Where I am now"). All raised concerns that a 
dose reduction would take them back to where they used to be ("Fears for the 
future") and most believed it to be a cost-cutting exercise. Most had "Hopes for 
the future", that a reduction would lower their risk of side effects, and 
release funds for other patients. They wanted a clear rationale for reduction, 
collaborative decision making, and control over flexible dosing ("Information 
needs").
CONCLUSION: Patients were fearful of reducing the dose of their bDMARDs, having 
previously experienced uncontrollable symptoms. However, most were willing to 
try, provided that there was a clear rationale and that it was in their best 
interests, with opportunities for collaboration and dose control. These patient 
perspectives will inform the provision of patient information to guide clinical 
discussions.

AIM: Recent studies highlight the importance of the interleukin (IL)-17A 
cytokine in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
There are also reports of associations between some single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-17A and RA but not SLE. Notably, these findings have 
not been replicated in all studied populations. The aim of this study was to 
investigate whether the IL-17A -737 T/C (rs8193036), -444A/G (rs3819024), 
-197G/A (rs2275913), and -121G/A (rs8193037) SNPs conferred susceptibility to 
SLE (or lupus nephritis) or to RA in a Mexican population.
METHODS: The study included 1367 Mexican subjects, 501 with RA, 367 with SLE, 
and 499 healthy controls. IL-17A was genotyped using a TaqMan 5' allelic 
discrimination assay.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the IL-17A -737 T/C, -444A/G, -197G/A, and 
-121G/A SNPs had similar genotype and allele frequencies in patients with SLE 
(or lupus nephritis) or RA and in controls. However, an IL-17A haplotype (TAGA) 
showed an association with SLE susceptibility (odds ratio 2.43, P = 0.004) but 
not with RA susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that the IL-17A -737T/C, -444A/G, -197G/A, 
and -121G/A SNPs are not risk factors for RA, but the IL-17A TAGA haplotype is a 
risk factor for SLE. This is the first report to document an association between 
IL-17A and SLE susceptibility in adults.

Medicine, Daegu, Korea.

AIM: The clinical importance of the anti-Ro antibody has not been completely 
understood. This study investigated identification of the association between 
mortality and clinical features in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases 
and detectable anti-Ro antibody titers.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 336 patients with autoimmune 
rheumatic diseases and positive anti-Ro antibody titers from January 2012 to 
January 2015. Clinical manifestations and other autoantibodies detected during 
the follow-up period were identified. Cumulative survival rates were assessed by 
Kaplan-Meier analysis. Differences between survival curves for each risk factor 
were analyzed by log-rank test. The relative risk of mortality was assessed 
using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).
RESULTS: There was no difference in the mortality rates of patients with 
autoimmune rheumatic diseases with or without detectable anti-Ro antibody (SMR: 
1.373, 95% CI: 0.539-2.791). Six patients (4 with systemic lupus erythematosus 
[SLE] and two with Sjögren's syndrome [SS]) died during the follow-up period. In 
the whole study population, the mortality rate of patients with lymphopenia was 
higher than those without lymphopenia (P = 0.023). In a sub-group of patients 
with both SLE and SS, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that lymphopenia and 
interstitial lung disease were associated with increased mortality (P = 0.024 
and P = 0.023, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that presence of the anti-Ro antibody was 
not associated with increased mortality in patients with autoimmune rheumatic 
disease. Conversely, we found that lymphopenia was independently associated with 
mortality in patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease.

AIM: The aim of this manuscript is to describe the development of the Asia 
Pacific Lupus Collaboration (APLC) cohort.
METHOD: The APLC cohort is an ongoing, prospective longitudinal cohort. Adult 
patients who meet either the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Modified 
Classification Criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or the Systemic 
Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Classification Criteria, and 
provide informed consent are recruited into the cohort. Patients are routinely 
followed up at 3- to 6-monthly intervals. Information on demographics, clinical 
manifestations, treatment, pathology results, outcomes, and patient-reported 
quality of life (Short-form 36 version 2) are collected using a standardized 
case report form. Each site is responsible for obtaining local ethics and 
governance approval, patient recruitment, data collection, and data transfer 
into a centralized APLC database.
RESULTS: The latest APLC cohort comprises 2160 patients with >12 000 visits from 
Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, 
Taiwan and Thailand. The APLC has proposed the Lupus Low Disease Activity State 
(LLDAS) as a treat-to-target (T2T) endpoint, and reported several retrospective 
and cross-sectional analyses consistent with the validity of LLDAS. Longitudinal 
validation of LLDAS as a T2T endpoint is currently underway.
CONCLUSION: The APLC cohort is one of the largest contemporary SLE patient 
cohorts in the world. It is the only cohort with substantial representation of 
Asian patients. This cohort represents a unique resource for future clinical 
research including evaluation of other endpoints and quality of care.

AIM: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe complication of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). There is a great interest in using microRNAs (miRNAs) as 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in autoimmune diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study evaluated miR-16, miR-21, miR-141, miR-146a, 
and miR-155 expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 
55 female SLE patients with absent, inactive, or active nephritis, and 30 
healthy controls (HCs) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: MiR-21 and miR-155 levels were significantly greater in the active 
nephritis group than in the absent, inactive or HC groups. Moreover, receiver 
operating characteristic and logistic regression analyses revealed miR-21 and 
miR-155 were significant risk factors for LN.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of miR-21 and miR-155 in PBMCs may participate in LN 
pathophysiology and these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for the condition.

OBJECTIVES: Real-world evidence on effectiveness of switching to biosimila r 
etanercept is scarce. In Denmark, a nationwide guideline of mandatory switch 
from 50 mg originator (ETA) to biosimilar (SB4) etanercept was issued for 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial 
spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) in 2016. Clinical characteristics and treatment 
outcomes were studied in ETA-treated patients, who switched to SB4 (switchers) 
or maintained ETA (non-switchers). Retention rates were compared with that of a 
historic cohort of ETA-treated patients. Switchers who resumed ETA treatment 
(back-switchers) were characterised.
METHODS: Observational cohort study based on the DANBIO registry. Treatment 
retention was explored by Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression (crude, 
adjusted).
RESULTS: 1621 (79%) of 2061 ETA-treated patients switched to SB4. Disease 
activity was unchanged 3 months' preswitch/postswitch. Non-switchers often 
received 25 mg ETA (ETA 25 mg pens/syringes and powder solution were still 
available). One-year adjusted retention rates were: non-switchers: 77% (95% CI: 
72% to 82%)/switchers: 83% (79% to 87%)/historic cohort: 90% (88% to 92%). 
Patients not in remission had lower retention rates than patients in remission, 
both in switchers (crude HR 1.7 (1.3 to 2.2)) and non-switchers (2.4 (1.7 to 
3.6)). During follow-up, 120 patients (7% of switchers) back-switched to ETA. 
Back-switchers' clinical characteristics were similar to switchers, and reasons 
for SB4 withdrawal were mainly subjective.
CONCLUSION: Seventy-nine per cent of patients switched from ETA to SB4. After 1 
year, adjusted treatment retention rates were lower in switchers versus the 
historic ETA cohort, but higher than in non-switchers. Withdrawal was more 
common in patients not in remission. The results suggest that switch outcomes in 
routine care are affected by patient-related factors and non-specific drug 
effects.

Previous infection with John Cunningham virus (JCV) increases the risk of 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis 
(MS) undergoing treatment with natalizumab. Patients who test negative for JCV 
antibodies must be assessed every six months due to the risk of seroconversion. 
Data from the United States of America, Portugal, Holland, France, United 
Kingdom and Sweden have shown a strong correlation between the use of 
natalizumab and JCV seroconversion. The authors present now data on patients 
from Brazil, as there are no data from Latin American countries published on 
this subject yet. A group of 86 patients with MS with negative results for 
antibodies against JCV were included in this analyses with at least two JCV 
antibodies testing. Twenty-five patients (29% of the total group) did not use 
natalizumab at any time, while the remaining 71% used natalizumab for a median 
period of 800 days (equivalent to 28 monthly infusions). Seroconversion was 
observed in 19 patients (22.1%). There was no association of seroconversion with 
gender, age, previous pulses of corticosteroid or specific MS-modifying drugs. 
The use of natalizumab was strongly associated to seroconversion (p < 0.0001). 
The present results confirm the influence of natalizumab therapy on JCV 
antibodies in several countries and continents.

Programmed death (PD)-1 receptors and their ligands have been identified in the 
pathogenesis and development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Two key 
pathways, toll-like receptor and type I interferon, are significant to SLE 
pathogenesis and modulate the expression of PD-1 and the ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2) 
through activation of NF-κB and/or STAT1. These cell signals are regulated by 
tyrosine kinase (Tyro, Axl, Mer) receptors (TAMs) that are aberrantly activated 
in SLE. STAT1 and NF-κB also exhibit crosstalk with the aryl hydrocarbon 
receptor (AHR). Ligands to AHR are identified in SLE etiology and pathogenesis. 
These ligands also regulate the activity of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which 
is an identified factor in SLE and PD-1 immunobiology. AHR is important in the 
maintenance of immune tolerance and the development of distinct immune subsets, 
highlighting a potential role of AHR in PD-1 immunobiology. Understanding the 
functions of AHR ligands as well as AHR crosstalk with STAT1, NF-κB, and EBV may 
provide insight into disease development, the PD-1 axis and immunotherapies that 
target PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1.

    J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2019 Mar;33(3):459-460.

BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune blistering 
disease. BP180 is the primary autoantigen of BP, and in a portion of BP cases, 
BP230 is the only target of autoantibodies. Such BP is called BP230-type BP. 
BP230-type BP tends to show milder clinical phenotypes than conventional BP, but 
the reason is unclear. The pathogenic roles of autoantibodies and complement 
activation have been shown in conventional BP, but the distribution of IgG 
subclasses and the degree of complement deposition in BP230-type BP remain 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the distribution of IgG subclasses and the degree of 
complement deposition in BP230-type BP with those in conventional BP with 
autoantibodies to BP180 and BP230 (BP180-BP230-type BP).
METHODS: The diagnosis of BP was confirmed by the histopathology of the lesions, 
the deposition of IgG and complement in the perilesional skin and the presence 
of circulating autoantibodies to BP180 and BP230. The disease severity was 
determined by bullous pemphigoid disease area index. The deposition of IgG 
subclasses and complement deposition were examined by direct immunofluorescence 
of the perilesional skin in 6 BP230-type BP cases and 11 BP180-BP230-type BP 
cases.
RESULTS: Sixty seven percent of BP230-type BP cases show a mild clinical 
phenotype. All BP230-type BP cases and 82% of BP180-BP230-type BP cases were 
found to demonstrate the clear deposition of IgG4 at the basement membrane zone 
of skin specimens. Notably, the deposition of IgG1 and IgG3 was faint or 
negative in all of the BP230-type BP cases, whereas they were clearly detected 
in 91% and 64% of the BP180-BP230-type BP cases, respectively. The deposition of 
complement C3 tended to be weaker in BP230-type BP than in BP180-BP230-type BP.
CONCLUSION: The mild clinical phenotype of BP230-type BP may correlate with the 
weaker deposition of IgG1, IgG3 and complement in the skin lesions.

BACKGROUND: Permanent hypoparathyroidism is the most common long-term 
complication after total thyroidectomy, causing significant morbidity and 
requiring long-term replacement therapy. Our study objective was to assess 
whether intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels on the first day after total 
thyroidectomy are a good predictor of permanent hypoparathyroidism.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study of all patients 
undergoing total thyroidectomy between January 2009 and December 2014. iPTH and 
calcium levels were measured the first day after surgery. Patients were followed 
up for at least one year after surgery.
RESULTS: The study group consisted of 481 patients with a mean age of 53±14 
years, 82% of them females. The most common reason for thyroidectomy was 
multinodular goiter (75%), followed by papillary thyroid cancer (15%). Transient 
hypocalcemia was the most common early complication after total thyroidectomy 
(49%), and permanent hypoparathyroidism was the most common long-term 
complication (6%). ROC curve analysis showed that iPTH level on the first 
postoperative day was a good predictor of permanent hypoparathyroidism (area 
under the curve 0.87; 95% CI: 0.84-0.91). Cut-off iPTH levels of 5pg/mL had 95% 
sensitivity, 77% specificity, 21.6% positive predictive value, and 99.6% 
negative predictive value.
CONCLUSIONS: iPTH level on the first day after total thyroidectomy is a useful 
predictor of permanent hypoparathyroidism because of its high negative 
predictive value. Serum iPTH levels >5pg/mL virtually exclude presence of 
permanent hypoparathyroidism.

S100 proteins are currently being investigated as potential diagnostic and 
prognostic biomarkers of several cancers and inflammatory diseases. The aims of 
this study were to analyse the plasma levels of S100A4, S100A8/9 and S100A12 in 
patients with incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus (iSLE), in patients with 
established SLE and in healthy controls (HCs) and to investigate the potential 
utility of the S100 proteins as diagnostic or activity-specific biomarkers in 
SLE. Plasma levels were measured by ELISA in a cross-sectional cohort study of 
44 patients with SLE, 8 patients with iSLE and 43 HCs. Disease activity was 
assessed using the SLEDAI-2K. The mean levels of all S100 proteins were 
significantly higher in SLE patients compared to HCs. In iSLE patients, the 
levels of S100A4 and S100A12 but not S100A8/9 were also significantly higher 
compared to HCs. There were no significant differences in S100 levels between 
the iSLE and SLE patients. Plasma S100 proteins levels effectively discriminated 
between SLE patients and HCs. The area under the curve (AUC) for S100A4, 
S100A8/9 and S100A12 plasma levels was 0.989 (95% CI 0.976-1.000), 0.678 (95% CI 
0.563-0.792) and 0.807 (95% CI 0.715-0.899), respectively. S100 levels did not 
differentiate between patients with high and low disease activity. Only the 
S100A12 levels were significantly associated with SLEDAI-2K and with cSLEDAI-2K. 
S100 proteins were significantly higher in SLE patients compared HCs and 
particularly S100A4 could be proposed as a potential diagnostic biomarker for 
SLE.

Convergent evidence from multiple and independent genetics studies implicate a 
small number of genes that predispose individuals to multiple autoimmune 
disorders (AuD). These intersecting loci reinforced the hypothesis that 
disorders with overlapping etiology group into a cluster of closely related 
genes within a whole genome molecular interaction network. We tested the 
hypothesis that "biological network proximity" within a whole genome molecular 
interaction network can be used to inform the search for multigene inheritance. 
Using a set of nine previously published genome wide association studies (GWAS) 
of AuD genes, we generated AuD-specific molecular interaction networks to 
identify networks of associated genes. We show that all nine "seed genes" can be 
connected within a 35-member network via interactions with 26 connecting genes. 
We show that this network is more connected than expected by chance, and 13 of 
the connecting genes showed association with multiple AuD upon GWAS reanalysis. 
Furthermore, we report association of SNPs in five new genes (IL10RA, DGKA, 
GRB2, STAT5A, and NFATC2) which were not previously considered as AuD 
candidates, and show significant association in novel disease samples of Crohn's 
disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. Furthermore, we show that the 
connecting genes show no association in four non-AuD GWAS. Finally, we test the 
connecting genes in psoriasis GWAS, and show association to previously 
identified loci and report new loci. These findings support the hypothesis that 
molecular interaction networks can be used to inform the search for multigene 
disease etiology, especially for disorders with overlapping etiology.

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune exocrinopathy associated with severe 
secretory alterations by disruption of the glandular architecture integrity, 
which is fundamental for a correct function and localization of the secretory 
machinery. Syt-1, PI(4,5)P2 and Ca2+ are significant factors controlling 
exocytosis in different secretory cells, the Ca2+ role being the most studied. 
Salivary acinar cells from SS-patients show a defective agonist-regulated 
intracellular Ca2+ release together with a decreased IP3R expression level, and 
this condition may explain a reduced water release. However, there are not 
reports where Syt-1, PI(4,5)P2 and Ca2+ in acinar cells of SS patients had been 
studied. In the present study, we analyzed the expression and/or localization of 
Syt-1 and PI(4,5)P2 in acinar cells of labial salivary gland biopsies from 
SS-patients and control individuals. Also, we evaluated whether the 
overexpression of Syt-1 and the loss of cell polarity induced by TNF-α or loss 
of interaction between acinar cell and basal lamina, alters directionality of 
the exocytosis process, Ca2+ signaling and α-amylase secretion in a 3D-acini 
model stimulated with cholinergic or β-adrenergic agonists. In addition, the 
correlation between Syt-1 protein levels and clinical parameters was evaluated. 
The results showed an increase of Syt-1 mRNA and protein levels, and a high 
number of co-localization points of Syt-1/STX4 and PI(4,5)P2/Ezrin in the acinar 
basolateral region of LSG from SS-patients. With regard to 3D-acini, Syt-1 
overexpression increased exocytosis in the apical pole compared to control 
acini. TNF-α stimulation increased exocytic events in the basal pole, which was 
further enhanced by Syt-1 overexpression. Additionally, altered acinar cell 
polarity affected Ca2+ signaling and amylase secretion. Overexpression of Syt-1 
was associated with salivary gland alterations revealing that the secretory 
dysfunction in SS-patients is linked to altered expression and/or localization 
of secretory machinery components together with impaired epithelial cell 
polarity. These findings provide a novel insight on the pathological mechanism 
implicated in ectopic secretory products to the extracellular matrix of LSG from 
SS-patients, which might initiate inflammation.

INTRODUCTION: Paramyotonia congenita (PMC) is a nondystrophic myotonic disorder 
that is believed to be caused by a defect in Nav 1.4 sodium channel 
inactivation. Ranolazine, which acts by enhancing slow inactivation of sodium 
channels, has been proposed as a therapeutic option, but in vivo studies are 
lacking.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label, single-center trial of ranolazine to 
evaluate efficacy and tolerability in patients with PMC. Subjective symptoms of 
stiffness, weakness, and pain as well as clinical and electrical myotonia were 
evaluated. Baseline measures were compared with those after 4 weeks of treatment 
with ranolazine.
RESULTS: Ranolazine was tolerated well without any serious adverse events. Both 
subjective symptoms and clinical myotonia were significantly improved. Duration 
of myotonia was reduced according to electromyography, but this change was not 
statistically significant in all tested muscles.
DISCUSSION: Our findings support the use of ranolazine as a treatment for 
myotonia in PMC and suggest that a randomized, placebo-controlled trial is 
warranted. Muscle Nerve 59:240-243, 2019.

INTRODUCTION: Although patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome frequently require 
orotracheal intubation and tracheostomy, the incidence and relevance of 
neurogenic dysphagia prior to intubation and risk factors for prolonged 
requirement for a tracheal cannula have not yet been identified.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the medical records of 88 patients was 
performed. Clinical characteristics were compared between intubated and 
nonintubated patients and between immediately decannulated and not immediately 
decannulated patients.
RESULTS: Thirty-five (39.7%) patients required tracheostomy. Neuromuscular 
weakness and related respiratory insufficiency were the main reasons for 
intubation. In the subgroup of tracheotomized patients, immediate decannulation 
after completed respiratory weaning was possible in 14 (40%) patients. The 
severity of dysphagia, in particular pharyngolaryngeal hypesthesia, was related 
to the length of cannulation.
DISCUSSION: Respiratory muscle weakness is the main reason for intubation, 
whereas neurogenic dysphagia is the main risk factor for persisting cannulation. 
Dysphagia after weaning is most frequently characterized by severe laryngeal 
sensory deficit. Muscle Nerve 59:194-200, 2019.

Orbital decompression surgery and medical therapy for thyroid eye disease (TED) 
have evolved over the past 150 years and afforded the opportunity to restore 
pre-disease appearance and visual function. This manuscript explores the past 
150 years of surgical innovation for the treatment of TED. The "Age of Surgical 
Heroism" spans the time from 1888 to 1979 during which the pioneers of orbital 
decompression developed lateral orbitotomy, transcranial decompression, 
paranasal sinus decompression, and transantral decompression despite an 
incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of both TED and a limited 
ability to non-invasively assess their patients. The "Age of Surgical 
Refinement" dawned with the development of computed tomography and represents 
the years 1979-2000. During this time, the "swinging eyelid" approach for two- 
and three-wall decompressions was introduced, a combined orbital-extradural four 
wall decompression procedure was developed, fat decompression was explored, and 
endoscopic decompression techniques were advanced. At the beginning of the 21st 
century, our understanding of the orbital pathophysiology of TED evolved 
significantly. Clinicians recognized the age-related phenotype of TED based 
largely on the relative contribution of extraocular muscle enlargement vs. 
orbital fat expansion. The "Modern Age" of Customized Orbital Decompression 
features both "medical decompression" during the active phase of TED and, in the 
stable phase, customized surgical plans incorporating individual patients' 
anatomy, orbital pathology, and surgical goals that collectively maximize 
therapeutic benefit while minimizing therapeutic morbidity.

OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis of natalizumab-related progressive multifocal 
leucoencephalopathy (NTZ-PML) in multiple sclerosis has been deemed a major 
priority by the regulatory agencies but has yet to become a reality. The current 
paper aims to: (1) investigate whether patients with NTZ-PML pass through a 
prolonged presymptomatic phase with MRI abnormalities, (2) estimate the 
longitudinal PML lesion volume increase during the presymptomatic phase and (3) 
estimate the presymptomatic phase length and its impact on therapy duration as a 
risk stratification parameter.
METHODS: All Italian patients who developed NTZ-PML between 2009 and 2018 were 
included. The data of patients with available prediagnostic MRI were analysed 
(n=41). Detailed clinical and neuroradiological information was available for 
each participant.
RESULTS: (1) PML lesions were detectable in the presymptomatic phase in 32/41 
(78%) patients; (ii) the lesion volume increased by 62.8 % for each month spent 
in the prediagnostic phase; (3) the prediagnostic phase length was 150.8±74.9 
days; (4) PML MRI features were detectable before the 24th month of therapy in 
31.7 % of patients in our cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the latency of PML clinical manifestation, the 
presymptomatic phase length supports the usefulness of MRI surveillance every 
3-4  months. Early diagnosis could prompt a better outcome for patients due to 
the relationship between lesion volume and JC virus infection. The insight from 
this study might also have an impact on risk stratification algorithms, as 
therapy duration as a parameter of stratification appears to need reassessment.

The current management of autoimmunity involves the administration of 
immunosuppressive drugs coupled to symptomatic and functional interventions such 
as anti-inflammatory therapies and hormone replacement. Given the chronic nature 
of autoimmunity, however, the ideal therapeutic strategy would be to reinduce 
self-tolerance before significant tissue damage has accrued. Defects in, or 
defective regulation of, key immune cells such as regulatory T cells have been 
documented in several types of human autoimmunity. Consequently, it has been 
suggested that the administration of ex vivo generated, tolerogenic immune cell 
populations could provide a tractable therapeutic strategy. Several potentially 
tolerogenic cellular therapies have been developed in recent years; concurrent 
advances in cell manufacturing technologies promise scalable, affordable 
interventions if safety and efficacy can be demonstrated. These therapies 
include mesenchymal stromal cells, tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T 
cells. Each has advantages and disadvantages, particularly in terms of the 
requirement for a bespoke versus an 'off-the-shelf' treatment but also their 
suitability in particular clinical scenarios. In this review, we examine the 
current evidence for these three types of cellular therapy, in the context of a 
broader discussion around potential development pathway(s) and their likely 
future role. A brief overview of preclinical data is followed by a comprehensive 
discussion of human data.

The paper shows that osteoporosis (OA) changes the SF content and the lipid 
profile substantially. To estimate the implication of the lipid environment in 
case the articular cartilage (AC) changes, we measured friction coefficient 
normal samples, with early and late stages of (OA). During joint inflammation 
and osteoarthritis, enzymatically activated β2-Glycoprotein I is transformed 
into antibody conformation. Our hypothesis about cartilage degradation of PL 
bilayers by antibodies (β2-Glycoprotein I) is considering antiphospholipid 
syndrome (APS), which was not discussed in the literature before. Deactivated PL 
molecule has no ability to form bilayers, lamellar phases, and liposomes. The 
phospholipid content in synovial fluid (SF) during joint inflammation, 
osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis is significantly higher (2-3 times) 
above the normal concentration of PL, and has a poor boundary-lubricating 
ability is deactivated.

BACKGROUND: Data on rescue treatment of autoimmune hepatitis in patients that 
fail standard treatment are sparse.
AIMS: To report our long-term experience with mycophenolate mofetil.
METHODS: Retrospective study in 22 patients with autoimmune hepatitis who failed 
azathioprine and prednisolone due to adverse events (n = 14, 64%), lack of 
remission (n = 5, 23%) or a combination (n = 3, 13%).
RESULTS: Mycophenolate mofetil was started at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day and 
increased to a maximum of 3 g/day. Follow-up was 0-6 months in 7 patients; more 
than 12 months in 15 (68%) and more than 24 months in 10. Normal 
aminotransferase levels were obtained (n = 3) or maintained (n = 7) in 10 
patients (45%) after three to 30 weeks. 12 patients (55%) were withdrawn during 
the first 6 months, due to adverse events. Three patients were switched to 
cyclosporine and one underwent liver transplantation. Successful treatment with 
mycophenolate mofetil continued in 10 patients (45%) for a median of 71 months 
(range 20-124). Of these, one stopped prednisolone, five have a prednisolone 
dose <5 mg daily and four patients 5-10 mg.
CONCLUSION: Approximately one of two patients with autoimmune hepatitis that 
fail standard treatment benefit from long-term maintenance with mycophenolate 
mofetil, especially those with previous intolerance to thiopurines, where 
mycophenolate mofetil is effective in two thirds.

Postirradiation morphea is an uncommon entity that has been mostly described in 
women with breast cancer. The increasing use of radiotherapy to treat breast 
cancer and the clinical similarities between morphea and other conditions, such 
as radiodermatitis, postirradiation fibrosis, and tumor recurrence, highlights 
the need for dermatologists to be familiar with this entity. We present a series 
of 6 women with a mean age of 64.2 years and a mean latency of 9.5 years between 
radiotherapy for breast cancer and onset of morphea. Four of the patients had a 
history of autoimmune disease: rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, vitiligo, 
and Crohn disease. No specific risk factors for postirradiation morphea have 
been identified to date, although it would appear that a history of autoimmune 
disease could be associated with an increased risk of morphea in patients 
treated with radiation therapy.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), an autoimmune 
component of Graves' disease, remains a disfiguring and potentially blinding 
condition. Here, the author reviews the role of insulin-like growth factor-I 
receptor pathway in TAO and how it might be therapeutically targeted.
METHODS: The recent literature is reviewed.
RESULTS: TAO involves reactivity of orbital connective tissues and their 
remodeling. While many of the details concerning the pathogenesis of TAO remain 
to be determined, several insights have come to light recently. Among them is 
the apparent involvement of IGF-IR. This receptor protein, a membrane-spanning 
tyrosine kinase receptor can form both physical and functional complexes with 
the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR). This is notable because TSHR is the established 
primary autoantigen in Graves' disease. IGF-IR activity is critical to signaling 
downstream from both IGF-IR and TSHR. In addition, antibodies against IGF-IR 
have been detected in patients with Graves' disease and in rodent models of TAO. 
Evidence has been put forward that these antibodies may act directly on IGF-IR, 
perhaps in some manner activating the receptor. These experimental observations 
have led to the development of a novel therapy for active TAO, utilizing a 
monoclonal anti-IGF-IR inhibitory antibody which had been produced originally as 
treatment for cancer. The agent, teprotumumab was recently evaluated in 
a clinical trial and found to be highly effective and relatively well-tolerated. 
It is currently undergoing assessment in a follow-up trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Should the current study yield similarly encouraging results, it is 
possible that teprotumumab will emerge as a paradigm-shifting medical therapy 
for TAO.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of specific amino acid positions, 
residues, and haplotypes of HLA-DRB1 in black South Africans with 
autoantibody-positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: High-resolution HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed in 266 black South 
Africans with autoantibody-positive RA and 362 ethnically and geographically 
matched controls. The alleles were converted to specific amino acid residues at 
polymorphic sites for downstream analyses. Logistic regression models were used 
to test whether variability at site, specific amino acid residues, and 
haplotypes (constructed from positions 11, 71, and 74) were associated with RA.
RESULTS: Of the 29 amino acid positions examined, positions 11, 13, and 33 
(permutation p = 3.4e-26, 1.2e-27, and 2.1e-28, respectively) showed the 
strongest association with RA. Univariate analyses of individual amino acid 
residues showed valine at position 11 (OR 5.1, 95% CI 3.7-7.0) and histidine at 
position 13 (OR 6.1, 95% CI 4.2-8.6) conferred the highest risk. The valine 
containing haplotypes of position 11, 71, 74, V_K_A conferred the most risk (OR 
4.52, 95% CI 2.68-7.61) and conversely the haplotype with serine at this 
position, S_K_R, conferred the most protection (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61-1.15).
CONCLUSION: Autoantibody-positive RA in black South Africans is associated with 
histidine at position 13 and valine at position 11 of HLA-DRB1, and haplotypes 
with valine at position 11 conferred the highest risk; conversely, serine at 
position 11 conveyed protection.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of arterial thrombotic events (ATE) and 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated 
vasculitis (AAV).
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study presenting the incidence of ATE 
(coronary events or ischemic stroke) and VTE [pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT)] in patients diagnosed with AAV between 2005 and 2014.
RESULTS: There were 204 patients with AAV who were identified. Median followup 
for surviving patients was 5.8 (range 1-10) years, accounting for 1088 
person-years (PY). The incidence of ATE was 2.67/100 PY (1.56 for coronary 
events and 1.10 for ischemic stroke) and for VTE was 1.47/100 PY (0.83 for DVT 
only and 0.64 for PE with/without DVT). On multivariate analysis, prior ischemic 
heart disease (IHD) and advancing age were the only independent predictors of 
ATE. Among patients without prior IHD or stroke, the incidence of ATE remained 
elevated at 2.32/100 PY (1.26 for coronary events and 1.06 for ischemic stroke). 
ATE, but not VTE, was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Event 
rates for both ATE and VTE were highest in the first year after diagnosis of AAV 
but remained above the population incidence during the 10-year followup period. 
In comparison to reported rates for the UK population, the event rates in our 
AAV patients were 15-times higher for coronary events, 11-times higher for 
incident stroke, and 20-times higher for VTE.
CONCLUSION: Patients with AAV have a high incidence of arterial and venous 
thrombosis, particularly in the first year after diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis to assess 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity during pregnancy using objective 
disease activity scoring systems.
METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE/Medline, Cochrane, and LactMed 
databases was performed. Our inclusion criteria for analysis were prospective 
studies, more than 5 patients per study, and data on RA using an objective 
scoring system conducted by a clinician/health professional.
RESULTS: Ten studies were eligible for final analysis, which included 237 
patients, of which prepartum data were available for 204 patients. Postpartum 
disease activity was recorded in 135 pregnancies.
CONCLUSION: Disease activity improved in 60% of patients with RA in pregnancy 
and flared in 46.7% postpartum.

OBJECTIVE: To describe an expanded teased nerve fibre classification in disease 
association.
METHODS: We reviewed four newly proposed teased nerve fibre types (Types J-M): 
Type J, rope-like fibres; K, fibril-like clumps of osmium positivity; L, 
cellular debris along and within nerve fibres; M, circular axonal inclusions 
surrounded by thin myelin. Different clinical pathological entities were studied 
for these fibre types including chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP: N=20); amyloid polyneuropathy (N=20); intraneural 
B-cell lymphoma (N=20) or adult-onset polyglucosan body disease (APBD: N=6) in 
comparison with 112 disease controls. Student's t-test was used to test 
significance of association between the identified fibre types and the specific 
clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Each fibre type significantly associated (p<0.001) with particular 
disease categories: Type J, 60% of CIDP cases; Type K, 75% of amyloid cases; 
Type L, 75% of intraneural lymphoma cases; Type M, 100% of APBD cases. Rarely 
were these fibres found in the other disease control cases ≤3% of cases. In 
three cases, the teased fibre findings were so striking additional paraffin 
nerve preparations were made to make the pathological diagnosis when initial 
paraffin sections were non-diagnostic.
CONCLUSIONS: Teased nerve fibre Types J-M associate with commonly seen 
pathological diagnosis and are helpful in the consideration of specific 
neuropathy diagnoses.

BACKGROUND: To identify the vascular risk factors associated with the occurrence 
of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients.
METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective cohort study using the 
nationwide electronic medical records (EMR) database. Patients with the 
diagnosis of MS were extracted from inpatient and outpatient EMR using the 
international classification of diseases, ninth/tenth revisions, clinical 
modification codes. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, and those where 
gender was not specified. Patients were further stratified based on their 
demographics, risk factors, medications, and comorbidities. Tobacco, diabetes, 
hypertension, and alcohol were the predicting variables; antiplatelet 
medication, and anticoagulant agents were the primary exposures for the 
development of ICH. A validated diagnosis code algorithm defined the diagnosis 
of ICH. Multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to assess the 
risk of ICH in MS patients.
RESULTS: Of the total 57,099 MS patients (women: 75%, n = 41,517), 107 (.19%) 
sustained an ICH. Age (OR = 2.74, CI = 1.13-6.62), use of anticoagulants 
(OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.30-3.56, P = .0028), and history of tobacco exposure 
(OR = 2.44, CI = 1.37-4.36, P = .0025) were associated with increased risk of 
ICH. Use of antiplatelet and disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) showed a protective 
trend against ICH.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco exposure and anticoagulant use were strongly associated 
with increased risk of ICH in patients with MS. There might be a protective 
effect that antiplatelet and DMDs have in the pathophysiology of this disease. 
Further prospective investigations are warranted to establish these 
associations.

Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis 
worldwide. The pathologic hallmark of IgAN is immune complex deposited in 
glomerular mesangium, which induces inflammation and affects the kidney's normal 
functions. The exact pathogenesis of IgAN, however, remains obscure. Further, in 
current clinical practice, the diagnosis relies on needle biopsy of renal 
tissue. Therefore, a non-invasive method for diagnosis and prognosis 
surveillance of the disease is highly desirable. To this end, we investigated 
the T cell receptor beta chain (TCRB) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) 
repertoire in circulating lymphocytes and compared them with kidney infiltrating 
lymphocytes using immune repertoire high throughput sequencing. We found that 
some features of TCRB and IGH in renal tissues were remarkably different from 
that in the blood, including decreased repertoire diversity, increased IgA and 
IgG frequency, and more antigen-experienced B cells. The 
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length of circulating TCRB and IGH 
in IgAN patients was significantly shorter than that in healthy controls, which 
is the result of both VDJ rearrangement and clonal selection. The IgA1 frequency 
in the blood of IgAN patients is significantly higher than that in other 
Nephropathy (NIgAN) patients and healthy control. Importantly we identified a 
set of TCRB and IGH clones, which can be used to distinguish IgAN from NIgAN and 
healthy controls with high accuracy. These results indicated that the TCRB and 
IGH repertoire can potentially serve as non-invasive biomarkers for the 
diagnosis of IgAN. The characteristics of the kidney infiltrating and 
circulating lymphocytes repertoires shed light on IgAN detection, treatment and 
surveillance.

CHEIROARTHROPATHY: A COMMON DISORDER IN PATIENTS IN THE T1D EXCHANGE.

Aleppo G, Kanapka LG, Foster NC, Wu M, Clements MA, Rickels MR, McGill JB, Beck 
RW; T1D Exchange Clinic Network.

OBJECTIVE: Diabetic cheiroarthropathy is a long-term complication of diabetes 
that causes significant morbidity and can impair functional abilities. It has 
not been well studied in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The T1D 
Exchange registry provided an opportunity to assess the frequency of 
cheiroarthropathy and related characteristics.
METHODS: An internet-based survey was sent to 6,199 registry participants ≥18 
years old, with 1,911 (31%) responding (62% female, 90% non-Hispanic White, mean 
age 40 years, median diabetes duration 20 years, mean glycated hemoglobin 
[HbA1c] 7.7% [61 mmol/mol]).
RESULTS: A total of 586 (31%) adults reported a diagnosis of ≥1 upper extremity 
disorder: 293 (15%) reported frozen shoulder, 293 (15%) trigger finger, 261 
(14%) carpal tunnel, and 92 (5%) Dupuytren contracture, with 281 (15%) reporting 
≥2 disorders. Those with upper extremity joint disorders were more likely older 
( P<.001) and had longer duration of diabetes ( P<.001) than those without. 
HbA1c levels at the time of survey completion were 7.6% in participants with 
cheiroarthropathy versus 7.8% (62 mmol/mol) in participants without 
cheiroarthropathy.
CONCLUSION: Cheiroarthropathy is common in adults with T1D. Additional research 
is needed to understand the pathogenesis and risk factors for this disorder. 
Standards of care for early recognition and treatment of diabetic 
cheiroarthropathy are also needed, particularly for adults with long-term 
diabetes. Improved awareness of cheiroarthropathy signs and symptoms of is 
needed so that patients can be identified and seek treatment before the 
condition causes disability.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory joint disease that eventually leads 
to permanent bone and cartilage destruction. Fas has already been established as 
the regulator of inflammation in RA, but its role in bone formation under 
arthritic conditions is not completely defined. The aim of this study was to 
assess the effect of Fas inactivation on the bone damage during murine 
antigen-induced arthritis. Subchondral bone of wild-type (WT) and Fas-knockout 
(Fas-/-) mice was evaluated by histomorphometry and microcomputerized 
tomography. Proportions of synovial bone and cartilage progenitors were assessed 
by flow cytometry. Synovial bone and cartilage progenitors were purified by 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting and expression of Fas and Fas-induced 
apoptosis were analyzed in vitro. Results showed that Fas-/- mice developed 
attenuated arthritis characterized by preserved epiphyseal bone and cartilage. A 
proportion of the earliest CD200+ bone and cartilage progenitors was reduced in 
WT mice with arthritis and was unaltered in Fas-/- mice. During osteoblastic 
differentiation in vitro, CD200+ cells express the highest levels of Fas and are 
removed by Fas ligation. These results suggest that Fas-induced apoptosis of 
early CD200+ osteoprogenitor population represents potential mechanism 
underlying the impaired bone formation in arthritis, so their preservation may 
represent the bone-protective mechanism during arthritis.-Lazić Mosler, E.,

OBJECTIVE: To establish whether serum adalimumab (ADA) trough level (ADA-TL) and 
antidrug antibody (ADA-ab) level predict flare after stopping ADA in established 
RA patients with long-standing low disease activity.
METHODS: From the clinical trial Potential Optimalisation and Effectiveness of 
TNF-blockers, 210 RA patients stopping ADA, who had been using ADA (40 mg/2 
weeks) for >1 year with conventional synthetic DMARDs and who had low disease 
activity (DAS28 < 3.2, or the rheumatologist's assessment of low disease 
activity with CRP < 10 mg/l) for at least 6 months prior to stopping, were 
followed for 1 year. The ADA-TL was measured (by ELISA) 12-17 days after the 
last ADA injection; if it was low, ADA-abs were measured (by an antigen-binding 
test). Association between time-to-flare and ADA-TL was evaluated by area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve and Cox regression.
RESULTS: A total of 106 (51%) patients flared within 1 year after stopping ADA. 
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for flare and ADA-TL 
was 0.50 (95% CI 0.42-0.58), P = 0.92. The hazard ratio for flare for ADA-TL ⩾ 5 
μg/ml (adequate level) vs <5 μg/ml was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.63-1.36) (not 
significant). Of the 4 patients with high ADA-ab levels, 2 patients (50%) 
experienced a flare.
CONCLUSION: Flare risk within the year following stopping ADA is not predicted 
by the ADA-TL or ADA-abs assessed at the moment of stopping.

CONTEXT: Two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), lenvatinib and vandetanib, are 
often used to treat advanced radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid 
cancer (RAI-R DTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), respectively. Fatigue is 
a common adverse event during treatment with these and other TKIs and a common 
cause of drug discontinuation or dosage reduction.
CASES DESCRIPTION: We evaluated the basal and stimulated adrenal function in 12 
patients with advanced RAI-R DTC and MTC treated with lenvatinib or vandetanib, 
respectively. Ten patients complaining of fatigue showed a progressive ACTH 
increase with normal cortisol levels. Moreover, six of 10 patients had a blunted 
cortisol response after ACTH stimulation, thus confirming the diagnosis of 
primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). The causal relationship between TKIs and 
PAI onset was also demonstrated by the repeated testing of adrenal function 
before and during treatment. Patients with PAI received cortisone acetate 
replacement therapy, with a substantial and prompt improvement in the degree of 
fatigue, as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
version 4.03, thus supporting the major impact of impaired adrenal function in 
the genesis of this adverse event.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that the occurrence of PAI may be a common cause of fatigue 
during lenvatinib and vandetanib treatment, and we therefore recommend testing 
adrenal function for a prompt start of replacement therapy to avoid treatment 
discontinuation, dosage reduction, and potentially severe PAI complications.

The Artificial Pancreas: What School Nurses Need to Know.

Latham J(1).

Author information:
(1)Registered Nurse, Tacoma, WA.

The hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system, a form of "artificial pancreas," 
is composed of an insulin pump, a standardized algorithm, and a continuous 
glucose monitor. The system streamlines insulin delivery by connecting 
continuous glucose monitor data with an insulin pump and an algorithm to drive 
basal insulin delivery. The hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system, approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration in 2016 for children older than 7 years, is 
a major improvement in the management of type 1 diabetes. The purpose of this 
article is to educate school nurses about the components of the hybrid 
closed-loop insulin delivery system, the relevance to care, and the future 
direction of blood glucose management.

and University of Bern, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between female reproductive and menopausal 
factors on functional and structural joint damage progression in women with RA.
METHODS: This is an observational cohort study of RA patients enrolled in the 
Swiss Clinical Quality Management Program for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Information 
about female hormonal factors, such as pregnancies, menopause and hormonal 
therapy, were retrospectively retrieved using a specific questionnaire. The 
primary outcome was functional disability progression (HAQ) and the secondary 
outcome radiographic joint damage progression. We compared the functional 
progression between pre- and post-menopausal women using a multilevel regression 
model for longitudinal data, adjusting for potential confounders, such as 
baseline age, years of education, disease duration, seropositivity, DAS28 and 
treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 1667 women were analysed, of whom 1025 (61%) were 
post-menopausal. Participants had a median of 6 HAQ assessments (interquartile 
range 3-10) during 5.1 (interquartile range 2.2-9.8) years of follow-up. At 
baseline, post-menopausal women had higher HAQ and erosion scores than 
pre-menopausal women. The evolution of HAQ scores over time differed between 
pre- and post-menopausal women (P < 0.001), with a less favourable evolution in 
post-menopausal women, particularly with earlier age at menopause. Erosion 
progression did not differ between pre- and post-menopausal women.
CONCLUSION: In women with RA, functional disability progression differed between 
pre- and post-menopausal women. The more favourable evolution of function in 
pre-menopausal women was not explained by disease duration, age or radiographic 
damage.

PURPOSE: To evaluate lower tear meniscus and corneal sub-basal nerve plexus in 
primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and Sicca syndrome patients.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 116 patients with Sicca syndrome associated 
with pSS and not associated with Sjögren's syndrome (non-SS Sicca) and 20 normal 
control subjects. Tear meniscus height and area were measured using anterior 
segment optical coherence tomography; corneal sub-basal nerve plexus density, 
length, and tortuosity were evaluated using in vivo confocal microscopy. Data 
analysis was performed using IBM-SPSS Statistics 24.0.
RESULTS: Corneal sub-basal nerve plexus density and length were significantly 
lower, and tortuosity was significantly higher in pSS and non-SS Sicca groups 
than in normal control subjects (P < 0.001; P = 0.018, respectively). Corneal 
sub-basal nerve plexus presented a strong association with Schirmer test I and 
tear breakup time. Cutoff values of sub-basal nerve plexus density (36.5 
nerve/mm) and length (12.5 mm/mm) presented 80.2% to 81.9% sensitivity and 85% 
specificity for detecting Sicca syndrome patients. No significant differences 
were found between the 3 groups regarding tear meniscus height and area.
CONCLUSIONS: Corneal sub-basal nerve plexus in vivo confocal microscopy may be a 
useful tool in the assessment of dry eye disease in Sicca syndrome, 
complementing the information provided by the conventional modalities used in 
dry eye disease evaluation.

Left ventricular noncompaction is a rare structural cardiomyopathy that can 
occur isolated or in relationship with other conditions, mainly with 
musculoskeletal diseases or congenital heart defects. The association of left 
ventricular noncompaction and connective tissue disorders, including systemic 
lupus erythematosus, was scarcely described in the literature. Reported cases 
are, more likely, cardiomyopathies mimicking left ventricular noncompaction or 
transient left ventricular noncompaction with ventricular function improving 
after appropriate treatment. We present the case of a 23-year-old woman admitted 
for cardiac evaluation because of ECG abnormalities observed during a routine 
check-up. Echocardiography showed severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, 
diffuse hypokinesis and hypertrabeculation, suggestive of left ventricular 
non-compaction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis. She 
later presented with specific clinical and biological parameters and was 
diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. Corticosteroid and 
hydroxychloroquine treatment induced general improvement of signs and symptoms, 
but no recovery of cardiac function.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the optimal setting of the predictive low glucose 
management (PLGM) algorithm for preventing exercise-induced hypoglycemia in 
adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: Thirty-four adolescents, 15 to 20 years, wearing PLGM system, were 
followed during 3 days exercise during a diabetes camp. PLGM threshold was set 
at 70 mg/dL between 8 am and 10 pm and 90 mg/dL during 10 pm and 8 am 
Adolescents were divided into group A and B, with PLGM threshold at 90 and 
70 mg/dL, respectively, during exercise. Time spent in hypoglycemia and AUC for 
time slots 8 am to 1 pm, 1 to 4 pm, 4 to 11 pm, 11 pm to 3 am, 3 to 8 am, in 
3 days were compared between groups by Wilcoxon rank sum test.
RESULTS: We analyzed 31 patients (median age 15.0 years, 58.1% males, median 
diabetes duration 7.0 years, hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 7.1%). No significant 
difference has been observed in time spent in hypoglycemia between groups using 
threshold 70 or 90. Time spent in target was similar in both groups, as well as 
time spent in hypo or hyperglycemia. The trends of blood glucose over the 3 days 
in the 2 groups over-lapped without significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: A PLGM threshold of 90 mg/dL during the night was associated with 
reduced time in hypoglycemia in adolescents doing frequent physical exercise, 
while maintaining 65.1% time in range during the day. However, a threshold of 
70 mg/dL seems to be safe in the duration of the physical exercise. PLGM system 
in adolescents with type 1 diabetes was effective to prevent hypoglycemia during 
and after exercise, irrespective of the PLGM thresholds used.

Hypoglycaemia is arguably the most important complication of insulin therapy in 
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Counter-regulation of hypoglycaemia is dependent on 
autonomic function and frequent hypoglycaemia may lead to reductions in both 
autonomic warning signals and the catecholamine response, the so-called 
"impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia". It is now appreciated that gastric 
emptying is a major determinant of the glycaemic response to 
carbohydrate-containing meals in both health and diabetes, that disordered 
(especially delayed) gastric emptying occurs frequently in diabetes, and that 
acute hypoglycaemia accelerates gastric emptying substantially. However, the 
potential relevance of gastric emptying to the predisposition to, and 
counter-regulation of, hypoglycaemia has received little attention. In 
insulin-treated patients, the rate of gastric emptying influences the timing of 
the postprandial insulin requirement, and gastroparesis is likely to predispose 
to postprandial hypoglycaemia. Conversely, the marked acceleration of gastric 
emptying induced by hypoglycaemia probably represents an important 
counter-regulatory response to increase the rate of carbohydrate absorption. 
This review summarizes the current knowledge of the inter-relationships between 
hypoglycaemia and gastric emptying, with a focus on clinical implications.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is increased in diabetes 
mellitus type 1 (DM1) patients. In most cases, CD is diagnosed in asymptomatic 
patients and hence periodic screening tests are recommended, but the timing, 
frequency of tests and indication for duodenal biopsy is unclear. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the dynamics of CD serology in DM1 and identify 
risk factors for CD.
METHODS: Celiac serology and duodenal biopsy results from 1990 until 2015 were 
collected from patients with DM1. The outcome of positive celiac serology, the 
incidence and risk factors for CD in DM1 patients were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 314 DM1 patients who had celiac serology were identified, 
with follow-up period up to 23 years. Of 31 patients (9.9%) with positive celiac 
serology, 11(35.4%) had spontaneous normalization after various time periods. 
Eighteen patients were diagnosed with CD (58.1% of positive celiac serology, 
5.73% of the study cohort). Age under 4.5 years was a risk factor for CD, but 
not family background of autoimmune diseases or gender. All patients with CD 
diagnosis were diagnosed during the first 6 years following DM1 diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Screening asymptomatic DM1 patients for CD beyond 6 years after 
diagnosis is not recommended. Spontaneous normalization of CD serology occurs, 
and hence, serologic follow-up may be performed. In children with DM1 diagnosis 
under the age of 4.5 years or with positive CD serology at DM1 diagnosis, there 
is an increased risk for CD and therefore positive serology should lead to 
biopsy.

In rheumatology practice, the risk of hepatotoxicity from medications, including 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, notably, and methotrexate, sulfasalazine, 
leflunomide, and azathioprine is highly recognized by the rheumatologists. On 
the other hand, hepatotoxicity is neither a commonly expected nor a well-known 
side effect of cyclophosphamide (CYC) which is particularly used for vital organ 
involvements in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic vasculitis. Here 
we reported a 19-year-old case of SLE who, while on oral CYC treatment of 
100 mg/day, was detected to have asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation and then 
developed acute hepatitis due to intravenously administered high-dose (1 g) CYC 
for neuro-lupus. Results of liver biopsy indicated drug-related toxicity. We 
discussed here with the other, although rare, cases available in the literature 
with an attempt to highlight the risk of hepatotoxicity and acute hepatitis due 
to CYC.

BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibody therapeutics (MATs) represent a rapidly 
expanding class of biological drugs used to treat a variety of diseases. The 
widespread use of MATs increasingly affects clinical laboratory medicine.
CONTENT: This review provides an overview of MATs currently approved for 
clinical use in the US, starting from basic biology of antibodies to the 
engineering, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, nomenclature, and 
production of MATs. Immunogenicity and the production of antidrug antibodies 
(ADAs) play a major role in loss of therapeutic response and the development of 
treatment failure to certain MATs. Laboratory-based monitoring for MATs and 
detection of ADAs represent emerging needs for optimizing the use of MATs to 
achieve the best outcomes at affordable cost. In addition, the increased use of 
MATs affects clinical laboratory testing by interference of MATs with clinical 
laboratory tests across different areas of laboratory medicine, including 
histocompatibility, blood bank, and monoclonal protein testing.
SUMMARY: The number of MATs is rapidly growing each year to address previously 
unmet clinical needs. Laboratory monitoring of MATs and detecting ADAs represent 
expanding areas of laboratory testing. Test-based strategies allow for treatment 
optimization at the level of the individual patient, thus providing a 
personalized medicine approach. In addition, clinical laboratories must be aware 
that the increasing use of MATs affects laboratory testing and be ready to 
implement methods to eliminate or mitigate interference with clinical tests.

Madrid, Spain.

Renal allograft thrombosis is the most frequent and devastating complication in 
the early postrenal transplantation period. Several risk factors to develop 
graft thrombosis depending on donors and recipients are well known. 
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is well recognized as an important cause of 
kidney injury, with specific clinical and histological features that may lead to 
renal injury caused by thrombosis at any location within the renal vasculature. 
There are 3 forms of APS, primary (the most common form), associated to other 
systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD-APS), and catastrophic. Nevertheless, patients 
with SAD-APS and renal failure only represent 2% to 5% in hemodialysis or 
transplantation. The presence of pretransplant antiphospholipid antibodies 
increases risk of graft thrombosis. A new form of APS based on IgA 
anti-β-2-glycoprotein-I (B2GPI) antibodies, representing up to 30% of patients 
in end-stage renal disease and renal transplantation, is the main independent 
risk factor for graft thrombosis and early graft loss after renal 
transplantation. In addition, B2GP1 bound to IgA aB2GP1 immunocomplexes have 
been described as a marker to predict thrombosis after renal transplantation in 
patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. Anticoagulation remains the main 
treatment to prevent renal allograft thrombosis, although new preventive 
strategies are coming. Future studies may help to identify better therapeutic 
targets.

The patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at greater risk of pain than 
people without the disease; however, the occurrence and characteristics of pain 
among these patients are incompletely described. We aimed to assess 
characteristics of pain amongst MS patients using MS patients who were recruited 
to participate in 3 studies in Sweden (n = 3877) and were matched with 
individuals without MS (n = 4548) by sex, year of birth, and region of 
residence. The Prescribed Drugs Register identified prescribed pain medication, 
overall and restricted to those given 4 or more prescriptions in 1 year to 
assess chronic pain. Anatomical therapeutic chemical codes classified whether 
pain was neuropathic, musculoskeletal, or migraine. Cox-proportional hazard 
models were used to estimate associations. Our findings showed the patients with 
MS were at increased risk of pain treatment, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.52 
(95% confidence interval 2.38-2.66). The largest magnitude HR was for 
neuropathic pain (5.73, 5.07-6.47) for which 34.2% (n = 1326) of the MS and 
7.15% (n = 325) of the non-MS cohort were prescribed a treatment. The HR for 
chronic pain treatment was 3.55 (3.27-3.84), indicating an increased effect size 
relative to any pain treatment. Chronic neuropathic pain showed the largest HR 
at 7.43 (6.21-8.89). Neuropathic pain was shown to be the primary mechanism 
leading to increased risk of pain in patients with MS.

OBJECTIVES: ABT-122 is a dual-variable-domain immunoglobulin that neutralizes 
both TNF-α and IL-17A. The objective of this work was to characterize 
exposure-response relationships for ABT-122 relative to adalimumab (TNF-α 
inhibitor) using ABT-122 phase 2 trials in patients with RA or PsA.
METHODS: Patients received subcutaneous doses of ABT-122 ranging from 60 mg 
every other week (EOW) to 240 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg EOW, or placebo 
(PsA patients only) for 12 weeks. Relationships between ABT-122 or adalimumab 
serum concentrations and time course of ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 and PASI50, 
PASI75 and PASI90 responses were characterized using a non-linear mixed-effects 
Markov modelling approach.
RESULTS: A total of 221 RA patients and 240 PsA patients were included in the 
analyses. At comparable molar exposures, there was no differentiation of 
efficacy between ABT-122 and adalimumab and there were no consistent differences 
between ABT-122 and adalimumab in the potency estimates for different efficacy 
endpoints based on the Markov models. Plateau of ABT-122 efficacy was achieved 
at exposures associated with the 120 mg EOW dose in patients with RA, which were 
comparable to molar exposures of adalimumab 40 mg EOW, and at the lowest dose of 
120 mg every week in patients with PsA.
CONCLUSION: The exposure-response relationships for ABT-122 were not 
distinguishably different from those of adalimumab in patients with RA or PsA. 
Overall, there was no clear evidence that inhibition of the IL-17 pathway 
provided incremental benefit in the presence of TNF-α inhibition.

OBJECTIVE: To determine, in a large, multiethnic/multiracial, prospective 
inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the 
frequency, attribution, clinical, and autoantibody associations with lupus 
psychosis and the short- and long-term outcomes as assessed by physicians and 
patients.
METHODS: Patients were evaluated annually for 19 neuropsychiatric (NP) events 
including psychosis. Scores on the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity 
Index 2000, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American 
College of Rheumatology Damage Index, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) were 
recorded. Time to event and linear regressions were used as appropriate.
RESULTS: Of 1,826 SLE patients, 88.8% were female and 48.8% were Caucasian. The 
mean ± SD age was 35.1 ± 13.3 years, the mean ± SD disease duration was 5.6 ± 
4.2 months, and the mean ± SD follow-up period was 7.4 ± 4.5 years. There were 
31 psychotic events in 28 of 1,826 patients (1.53%), and most patients had a 
single event (26 of 28 [93%]). In the majority of patients (20 of 25 [80%]) and 
events (28 of 31 [90%]), psychosis was attributed to SLE, usually either in the 
year prior to or within 3 years of SLE diagnosis. Positive associations (hazard 
ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]) with lupus psychosis were 
previous SLE NP events (HR 3.59 [95% CI 1.16-11.14]), male sex (HR 3.0 [95% CI 
1.20-7.50]), younger age at SLE diagnosis (per 10 years) (HR 1.45 [95% CI 
1.01-2.07]), and African ancestry (HR 4.59 [95% CI 1.79-11.76]). By physician 
assessment, most psychotic events resolved by the second annual visit following 
onset, in parallel with an improvement in patient-reported SF-36 summary and 
subscale scores.
CONCLUSION: Psychosis is an infrequent manifestation of NPSLE. Generally, it 
occurs early after SLE onset and has a significant negative impact on health 
status. As determined by patient and physician report, the short- and long-term 
outlooks are good for most patients, although careful follow-up is required.

BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress may play an important role in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) etiopathogenesis. The thiol group is a very strong antioxidant. In this 
study, we aimed to investigate the presence of oxidative stress in patients with 
RA by evaluating thiol/disulfide homeostasis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 50 female RA patients and 50 healthy female 
controls were included in this study. Thiol and disulfide values were calculated 
utilizing novel methods.
RESULTS: Native thiol (p < 0.001) and total thiol (p < 0.001) levels of RA 
patients were significantly lower compared to values in the control group. 
However, the disulfide (p < 0.001) levels of RA patients were strongly higher 
than in healthy individuals. A negative correlation was found between thiol and 
disease activity score-28 among the patients, whereas a positive correlation was 
found between disulfide and disease activity score-28 among the patients.
CONCLUSION: We found that the thiol-disulfide rate deteriorated in RA patients, 
with the proportion of disulfide increasing. There is a strong correlation 
between the decrease in thiol levels, increase in disulfide levels and the 
disease activity scores.

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD), also known as histiocytic necrotizing 
lymphadenitis, is a rare, benign, self-limiting disease characterized by 
cervical lymphadenopathy and fever. Since KFD was first reported in 1972, the 
validity of this clinical entity has been controversial and its aetiology 
remains unknown. Herein, we report a case of a patient with KFD, which was 
believed to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) can affect various organs, and the pancreas and 
salivary gland are representative examples. We report a rare case of IgG4-RD of 
the paratestis. A 74-year-old man presented with left scrotal swelling. 
Scrotopuncture drainage and cytology confirmed a clear, yellow retention liquid 
(130 mL) with many small, similar lymphocytes and a few plasmacytes. Many 
lymphoid cells were immunopositive for CD3 on a cell block section, indicating 
that a predominant type of lymphoid cells was T cell. There were also some CD20 
immunopositive cells and a few IgG4 immunopositive cells. Two months later the 
left scrotal swelling had returned, and he underwent radical inguinal 
orchiectomy. Microscopically, there was considerable lymphoplasmacytic 
inflammatory infiltration, fibrosis and abundant IgG4 immunopositive cells in 
the paratesticular region. The histopathologic and immunohistochemistry findings 
were consistent with IgG4-RD. However, the abundant T cells in the scrotal fluid 
complicated the cytological diagnosis in our case.

Mycophenolic acid (MPA), a noncompetitive, selective and reversible inhibitor of 
inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), is an immunosuppressive agent 
that has a long history in medicine. Mechanistically, the inhibition of IMPDH 
leads to the selective and eventual arrest of T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation. 
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the first MPA-based product to receive marketing 
approval over two decades ago, was originally indicated for the prophylaxis of 
organ rejection in human transplant patients. Given its broad immunosuppressive 
properties and ability to selectively inhibit lymphocyte division and effector 
functions, the clinical utility of MPA was subsequently explored in a host of 
autoimmune diseases. Human clinical studies have shown MPA to be safe and 
effective and support its off-label administration for immune-mediated diseases 
such as lupus, myasthenia gravis and atopic dermatitis. MMF became generically 
available in the United States in 2008, and its clinical utility is increasingly 
being explored as a treatment option for dogs with immune-mediated diseases. 
This review summarizes the available literature for MPA pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics, and the current status of MPA as a treatment for client-owned 
dogs diagnosed with immune-mediated diseases.

and University of Helsinki, PL 435, 00029, Helsinki, Finland.

OBJECTIVES: Across diagnosis groups, transition of adolescents and young adults 
from children's hospitals to adult care associates with decreased treatment 
adherence and suboptimal treatment results. Our aim was to compare the 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease activity of juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients after the transfer of care to the adult 
clinic and adult patients in the same outpatient clinic.
METHODS: All consecutive JIA patients aged 16 to 20 years who visited the 
transition clinic between September 2016 and August 2017 and all consecutive 
adult onset arthritis patients between December 2016 and August 2017 in the 
rheumatology outpatient clinic of Helsinki University Hospital were evaluated. 
HRQoL was measured by a generic instrument, 15D.
RESULTS: A total of 291 patients, 130 JIA, and 161 adults were identified with 
respective median disease durations of 6.5 and 4.0 years. Adults had lower HRQoL 
measured by 15D (median 0.90 vs. 0.96, P < 0.001) and higher Disease Activity 
Score 28 (DAS28) than JIA patients (median 2.4 vs. 1.6, P < 0.001). Adults 
smoked more frequently than JIA patients (22% vs. 7%, P < 0.001). In multiple 
regression, female gender, smoking, disease activity, and obesity were 
associated with poorer HRQoL. Smoking adults had more active disease (DAS28 
median 3.1 vs. 2.1, P = 0.031) and lower HRQoL (15D median 0.86 vs. 0.93, 
P < 0.001) than non-smoking adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Transition phase JIA patients had acceptable HRQoL and lower 
disease activity than patients with adult onset rheumatic diseases with similar 
disease duration. Smoking was associated with more active disease and lower 
HRQoL.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder 
of unknown etiology. Considerable evidence supports a genetic basis for 
susceptibility to SLE. Genetic and functional data suggested the CD40 receptor 
(CD40) and CD40 ligand (CD40L) as strong candidate genes for SLE.
AIM: To investigate whether CD40 gene rs1883832 C/T single-nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) and/or soluble CD40 (sCD40) are associated with SLE in the 
Egyptian population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included a hundred SLE patients, and a fifty 
age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. CD40 gene rs1883832 C/T 
genotyping was carried out using restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP), while sCD40 levels were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS: CD40 rs1883832C/T genotypes (CC, TT, and CT) as well as CD40 alleles (C 
and T) did not differ between SLE patients and normal control (p = 0.63, 0.37, 
and 0.31 respectively). Though did not reach statistical significance, carriers 
of genotype CT had 1.5 times more chance to develop SLE compared to wild 
homozygous CC genotype carriers (OR 1.44), while carriers of genotype TT had ~ 2 
times more chance to have SLE than CC carries (OR 1.96). Accordingly, the 
carriers of the T allele had ¬ 1.5 times more chance to get SLE compared to the 
carriers of the C allele (OR 1.4). The serum sCD40 level was significantly 
higher in SLE patients compared to healthy control (3.4 vs. 0.8 ng/mL, 
p < 0.001). In SLE patients, using CC as the reference genotype, serum sCD40 
level was significantly higher in the carriers of the homozygous genotype TT 
(3.8 ± 1.3 vs. 2.9 ± 1.9, p = 0.0001), and T allele (3.6 ± 1.4 vs. 3.0 ± 1.5, 
p = 0.003). Moreover, sCD40 could discriminate SLE patients from normal subjects 
at a cutoff value of 0.885 ng/mL with 98% sensitivity and 96% specificity 
(AUC = 0.999, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study did not prove CD40 gene (rs1883832 C/T) polymorphism as a 
clear risk factor of SLE in this cohort of Egyptian patients, though it was 
highly likely associated with the carriers of T allele. In the same context, 
significant high sCD40 levels were observed in the T allele carriers.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic autoimmune disease characterized 
by increased cardiovascular morbidity. Several previous studies assessed 
associations between common atherosclerotic genetic risk factors and subclinical 
atherosclerosis (SA) in RA patients, yet most of them gave negative results. We 
undertook a cross-sectional study to evaluate the association between previously 
reported SNPs and subclinical atherosclerosis in a cohort of Polish RA patients. 
29 SNPs associated with atherosclerosis in general population were genotyped in 
289 RA patients: 116 patients with SA (increased carotid intima-media thickness 
and/or presence of carotid plaque) and 173 patients without SA. To assess the 
cumulative effect of SNPs we calculated 3 weighted genetic risk scores: GRSIMT, 
GRSCP and GRSCAD, comprising intima-media thickness-associated SNPs, carotid 
plaque-associated SNPs and coronary artery disease-associated SNPs, 
respectively. None of the SNPs showed a significant association with SA. 
However, we found an association between SA and GRSIMT. Interestingly, this 
association was limited to patients with short disease duration (P = 0.00004 vs. 
P > 0.5, for comparison of GRSIMT among patients within the 1st quartile of 
disease duration vs. others, respectively). Patients within the 1st quartile of 
disease duration were more frequently disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs)-naïve and less frequently treated with biologics. Our study suggests 
that in patients with early RA subclinical atherosclerosis may be driven by 
similar genetic factors as in general population, while in long-lasting disease, 
the role common genetic risk factors may decrease. Possibly, this effect may be 
due to the influence of DMARDs.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with hyperthyroidism lacking autoimmune features but showing 
diffuse uptake on thyroid scintigram can have either Graves' disease or germline 
activating TSH receptor (TSHR) mutation. It is important to identify patients 
with activating TSHR mutation due to treatment implication, but the overlapping 
clinical features with Graves' disease make it difficult to discriminate these 
two conditions without genetic testing. Our study aimed to assess the potential 
of systematic TSHR mutation screening in adults with hyperthyroidism, showing 
diffuse uptake on thyroid scintigraphy but absence of TSH receptor antibodies 
(TRAb) and clinical signs of autoimmunity.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of Caucasian adults with hyperthyroidism, 
managed at three endocrine centres in the South West, UK, from January 2006 to 
April 2017.
METHODS: We recruited 78 adult Caucasian patients with hyperthyroidism showing 
diffuse uptake on 99m Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy but without TRAb and 
other autoimmune clinical features of Graves' disease (such as 
thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy or dermopathy). Genomic DNA of these patients 
was analysed for variants in the TSHR gene.
RESULTS: Genetic analysis identified 11 patients with four variants in TSHR 
[p.(Glu34Lys), p.(Asp36His), p.(Pro52Thr) and p.(Ile334Thr)]. None of these 
variants were pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics 
and Genomics guideline.
CONCLUSIONS: Activating TSHR mutations are a rare cause of nonautoimmune adult 
hyperthyroidism. Our study does not support the routine genetic testing in adult 
patients with hyperthyroidism showing diffuse uptake on scintigraphy but 
negative TRAb and lacking extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease.

Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with an increased frequency of autoimmunity. 
Frequently observed autoimmune diseases in TS are also seen in the autoimmune 
polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS I), of which Addison disease is a key 
component. An overlapping antibody profile between TS and APS I could be 
considered. The aim of this work was to study women with TS regarding 
21-hydroxylase (21-OH) antibodies and interferon omega (IFN-ω) antibodies, a 
highly specific marker for APS I, to determine if there are immunological 
overlaps between TS and APS I. Blood samples from 141 TS were assayed for 21-OH 
antibodies and IFN-ω antibodies using in-vitro-transcribed and translated 
autoantigen. Indices with a cut-off point of 57 and 200 for 21-OH antibody and 
IFN-ω antibody were used as reference. The median age of TS was 31·6 years 
(range = 11·2-62·2). Positive indices of 21-OH antibodies were present in six TS 
(4%), with a mean of 144·8 (range = 60-535). None had apparent adrenal 
insufficiency. There was no age difference comparing 21-OH antibody-positive TS 
(median age = 33·9 years, range = 17·7-44·7) and 21-OH antibody-negative TS 
(median age = 31·6 years, range = 11·2-62·2) (P = 0·8). No TS was positive for 
IFN-ω antibodies (mean = 42·4, range = -435-191). No overlapping autoimmune 
profile between TS and APS I was found. Autoimmunity against 21-OH among TS 
patients was more prevalent than previously identified, suggesting an increased 
risk of adrenal failure in TS. However, whether adrenal impairment will develop 
remains unknown.

BACKGROUND: Exercise-training is a beneficial approach for improving function in 
persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it is unlikely that every 
participant who engages in an exercise-training intervention will demonstrate 
similar benefits. Identifying factors that may influence the accrual of specific 
exercise-training benefits can aid in the development of optimized 
rehabilitation interventions for improving specific outcomes in MS.
OBJECTIVE: This study described possible response heterogeneity in physical 
fitness, mobility and cognitive outcomes with exercise-training and identified 
baseline performance, compliance and demographic/clinical outcomes as possible 
predictors of exercise-related changes in those outcomes.
METHODS: Thirty-two persons with MS-related mobility disability completed 
6-months of multimodal exercise-training. Physical fitness, mobility and 
cognitive processing speed (CPS) were measured before and after the 6 months.
RESULTS: There was response heterogeneity in fitness, mobility and cognitive 
outcomes with multimodal exercise-training. Low baseline aerobic fitness, slow 
walking speed and slow CPS were associated with greater exercise-related 
improvements in those respective outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Those with MS-related mobility disability who have the lowest 
aerobic fitness, walking speed and CPS might benefit the most from multimodal 
exercise-training. This provides critical evidence for informing the development 
of a precision medicine framework for improving targeted outcomes with 
exercise-training in MS.

Hypoglycemia is a common and dangerous complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
Although some worry about hypoglycemia is adaptive, some individuals develop 
severe and impairing anxiety symptoms about hypoglycemic episodes. This 
presentation, known as severe fear of hypoglycemia (FOH), is similar to a 
specific phobia, and becomes problematic when it interferes with one's quality 
of life or T1D management. Although FOH is common, there have not yet been any 
treatment studies to address severe and impairing levels of FOH in the T1D 
population. The purpose of the following case report is to: (a) describe the 
presentation of a severe case of FOH in a young adult with T1D; (b) demonstrate 
the effectiveness of graduated exposure therapy for treatment of severe FOH; and 
(c) provide implications for clinical practice. A previously developed 
conceptual model for FOH management guided treatment. Treatment using graduated 
exposure therapy for FOH resulted in reduced worry about low blood glucose (BG) 
and significant reduction in behaviors to maintain high BG levels. Assessment of 
FOH and the risk and benefits of using a continuous glucose monitor among 
individuals with T1D and their families are discussed.

Vitamin D has immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
anti-fibrotic actions that may impact on the occurrence and outcome of 
immune-mediated disease. The goals of this review are to describe the nature of 
these expanded roles, examine the implications of vitamin D deficiency in 
autoimmune hepatitis, and identify opportunities for future investigation. 
Abstracts were identified in PubMed by multiple search terms. Full-length 
articles were selected for review, and secondary and tertiary bibliographies 
were developed. Vitamin D receptors are expressed on the principal cell 
populations involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses. Macrophages 
and dendritic cells can produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D within the 
microenvironment. This active form of vitamin D can inhibit immune cell 
proliferation, promote an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, expand regulatory 
T cells, enhance glucocorticoid actions, increase glutathione production, and 
inhibit hepatic stellate cells. Vitamin D deficiency has been commonly present 
in patients with immune-mediated liver and non-liver diseases, and it has been 
associated with histological severity, advanced hepatic fibrosis, and 
non-response to conventional glucocorticoid therapy in autoimmune hepatitis. 
Vitamin D analogues with high potency, low calcemic effects, and independence 
from hepatic hydroxylation are possible interventions. In conclusion, vitamin D 
has properties that could ameliorate immune-mediated disease, and vitamin D 
deficiency has been a common finding in immune-mediated liver and non-liver 
diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis. Loss of vitamin D-dependent 
homeostatic mechanisms may promote disease progression. Vitamin D analogues that 
are independent of hepatic hydroxylation constitute an investigational 
opportunity to supplement current management of autoimmune hepatitis.

The incidence and clinical implications of autoimmune diseases (ADs) in patients 
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to 
examine the prevalence of ADs in NHL and define the clinical characteristics and 
prognosis of AD-associated NHL patients. Patients diagnosed with NHL in our 
institute between 1995 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed to assess the 
incidence of ADs. Of 4880 patients with NHL, 140 (2.9%) presented with 
autoimmunity, with a total of 24 ADs. The most common AD was Sjögren syndrome, 
followed by autoimmune cytopenia, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. 
Psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis were significantly associated with 
pre-existing ADs, whereas autoimmune cytopenia was significantly associated with 
secondary AD. Sjögren syndrome was significantly associated with B-cell 
lymphoma, and systemic vasculitis was significantly associated with T-cell 
lymphoma. Patients with AD-associated NHL had a high frequency of extranodal 
involvement(87%), with significant associations between specific extranodal 
sites of lymphoma and subtypes of ADs. Among patients with available data on 
pre-treatment peripheral blood Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA(n = 68), elevated 
EBV-DNA load was observed in a variety of NHL subtypes, including 20% of 
marginal zone lymphoma and 14.3% of follicular lymphoma patients. In a 
matched-pair analysis, survival did not differ significantly between NHL 
patients with and without ADs. However, for NHL patients with pre-existing ADs, 
a prior history of systemic corticosteroids therapy was significantly associated 
with worse survival (HR = 7.33, P = 0.006). Taken together, our data suggest 
that a broad spectrum of ADs is associated with NHL, and AD-associated NHL has 
distinct features with regard to clinical manifestations and prognosis.

Type 1 diabetes has been associated with alterations in attentional processing 
and other cognitive functions, and previous studies have found alterations in 
both brain structure and function in affected patients. However, these previous 
neuroimaging studies have generally examined older patients, particularly those 
with major comorbidities known to affect functioning independent of diabetes. 
The primary aim of the current study was to examine the neural dynamics of 
selective attention processing in a young group of patients with type 1 diabetes 
who were otherwise healthy (i.e., without major comorbidities). Our hypothesis 
was that these patients would exhibit significant aberrations in attention 
circuitry relative to closely matched controls. The final sample included 69 
participants age 19-35 years old, 35 with type 1 diabetes and 34 matched 
nondiabetic controls, who completed an Eriksen flanker task while undergoing 
magnetoencephalography. Significant group differences in flanker interference 
activity were found across a network of brain regions, including the anterior 
cingulate, inferior parietal cortices, paracentral lobule, and the left 
precentral gyrus. In addition, neural activity in the anterior cingulate and the 
paracentral lobule was correlated with disease duration in patients with type 1 
diabetes. These findings suggest that alterations in the neural circuitry 
underlying selective attention emerge early in the disease process and are 
specifically related to type 1 diabetes and not common comorbidities. These 
findings highlight the need for longitudinal studies in large cohorts to clarify 
the clinical implications of type 1 diabetes on cognition and the brain.

Autoantibodies characteristic for anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) are anti-β2 -glycoprotein I (β2 GPI) antibodies and 
anti-DNA antibodies, respectively, and almost half of APS cases occur in SLE. 
Anti-β2 GPI antibodies are recognized to play a pivotal role in inducing a 
prothrombotic state, but the precise mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In 
a widely accepted view, binding of anti-β2 GPI antibodies to cell surface β2 GPI 
in monocytes and endothelial cells triggers the Toll-like receptor 4-myeloid 
differentiation primary response 88 (TLR)-4-MyD88) signaling pathway which leads 
to activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mitogen-activated 
protein kinase kinase 1/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MEK-1/ERK) 
and/or nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and expression of tissue factor (TF). 
However, resting cells do not express substantial amounts of TLR-4. Previously, 
we generated a mouse monoclonal anti-β2 GPI antibody WB-6 and showed that it 
induced a prothrombotic state - including TF expression on circulating 
monocytes - in normal mice. In the current study, we aimed to clarify the 
mechanism of interaction between WB-6 and resting monocytes, and found that WB-6 
exhibits binding activity to DNA and enters living monocytes or a monocytic cell 
line and, to a lesser extent, vascular endothelial cells. Treatment of the cells 
with DNase I reduced the internalization, suggesting the involvement of cell 
surface DNA in this phenomenon. Monocytes harboring internalized WB-6 expressed 
TF and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α which, in turn, stimulated endothelial 
cells to express intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-I) and vascular cell 
adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-I). These results suggest the possibility that a 
subset of anti-β2 GPI antibodies with dual reactivity to DNA possesses ability 
to stimulate DNA sensors in the cytoplasm, in addition to the cell surface 
receptor-mediated pathways, leading to produce proinflammatory and prothrombotic 
states.

BACKGROUND: Azathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare complication of 
azathioprine therapy. Its symptoms resemble infection or relapse of inflammatory 
disease, hindering correct diagnosis. Current literature is limited to sporadic 
case reports and reviews.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of azathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome 
and describe its characteristics in the context of an observational cohort of 
patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. 
Also, to facilitate early recognition and awareness among clinicians.
METHODS: Within a cohort of 290 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis 
receiving azathioprine maintenance therapy, frequency of azathioprine 
hypersensitivity was described and characteristics were compared between 
hypersensitive and nonhypersensitive patients. Clinical picture, laboratory 
abnormalities, and concurrent medication of patients with azathioprine 
hypersensitivity were described.
RESULTS: Of 290 patients, 25 (9%) experienced azathioprine hypersensitivity 
after a median of 14 (interquartile range [IQR] 12-18) days. Frequent symptoms 
were fever (100%), malaise (60%), arthralgia (36%), and rash (32%). All patients 
used prednisolone (median 10 mg/day, IQR 9.4-16.3 mg/day) at the time of the 
hypersensitivity reaction. Most patients had a rise in C-reactive protein (CRP), 
leukocyte counts, and neutrophil counts, but no eosinophilia. Thiopurine 
S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity was significantly lower in hypersensitive 
patients (median 74.4 [IQR 58.0-80.1] nmol/gHb/L) compared with controls (median 
81.4 [71.9-90.5] nmol/gHb/L), P = .01. Hypersensitive patients had a higher risk 
of relapse (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-4.2; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome is strikingly common in 
ANCA-associated vasculitis, might be associated with reduced TPMT activity, is 
accompanied by an increase in neutrophil counts, and may occur even during 
concomitant prednisolone therapy. Proper recognition may prevent unnecessary 
hospital procedures and damage to the patient.

PURPOSE: Typhlitis, also known as neutropenic colitis, is a rare inflammatory 
condition and a potentially life-threatening disease process that typically 
involves the cecum. Delay in diagnosis may lead to a fatal prognosis with a 
death rate of 21-48%. Ultrasound evaluation of right lower quadrant may lead to 
an accurate and rapid diagnosis.
METHODS: We describe the case of a 59-year-old female with advanced 
Churg-Strauss syndrome treated with cyclophosphamide, with acute right lower 
quadrant pain.
RESULTS: Ultrasound was the first diagnostic step in the diagnosis of typhlitis. 
Sonographic findings were comparable to CT imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: Bowel bedside ultrasound evaluation in emergency settings may lead 
to a prompt and definitive diagnosis. Although CT is considered the gold 
standard in the diagnosis and staging of neutropenic colitis, ultrasound was 
able to identify the pathology accurately. Ultrasound findings of typhlitis are 
highly characteristic, showing circumferential wall thickening with predominant 
submucosa.

La tiflite, nota anche come colite neutropenica, è una rara forma di colite 
infiammatoria potenzialmente mortale (21–48%) che coinvolge il cieco, correlata 
ad alta mortalità se diagnosticata tardivamente. La tipica sintomatologia e 
localizzazione a livello cecale, rendono la valutazione ecografica e la 
conoscenza della patologia fondamentale, consentendo una diagnosi differenziale 
rapida ed efficace. Descriviamo il caso di una donna di 59 anni affetta da 
sindrome di Churg Strauss, in trattamento con ciclofosfamide che presentava 
dolore addominale localizzato al quadrante inferiore destro. L’ecografia della 
fossa iliaca destra ha dimostrato un quadro caratteristico e sovrapponibile ai 
reperti TC, con presenza di ispessimento e stratificazione parietale del ceco e 
dell’ultima ansa con prevalenza della sottomucosa. L’esame ecografico 
dell’intestino in emergenza è in grado di diagnosticare rapidamente ed 
efficacemente molte patologie intestinali acute, consentendo di differenziare 
tra patologie chirurgiche non chirurgiche. Nel caso della colite neutropenica, 
anche se La TC è ancora considerata il gold standard diagnostico, l’esame 
ecografico può identificare correttamente il quadro patologico ed essere una 
valido strumento diagnostico per il monitoraggio. I segni ecografici di tifilite 
sono estremamente caratteristici mostrando un incremento di spessore di parete 
circonferenziale con prevalenza ed iperecogenicità della sottomucosa.

A previously well man presented with several months' history of neurological 
symptoms including diplopia and balance difficulties. Examination revealed 
fluctuating neurological deficits, fatigable weakness and slowed saccades. 
Extensive testing revealed mildly elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein, strongly 
positive single fiber electromyography and a dorsal pontine lesion at the floor 
of the 4th ventricle. An autoimmune process was felt to best account for the 
myasthenic presentation while the differential diagnoses for the brainstem 
lesion included glioma. Aggressive immunotherapy failed to halt clinical 
deterioration; over months he developed generalized weakness, aspiration 
pneumonia and died. Post-mortem analysis revealed glioneuronal tumor 
infiltration throughout the brainstem, cerebellum and along the meningeal 
surface. This is an unusual case of an infiltrative brainstem lesion, with the 
presentation suggesting a primary diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The 
progressive nature of the illness, despite aggressive immune therapy, together 
with slow saccades, underscored a more sinister process. Cerebral imaging should 
be performed in patients with fluctuating neurological symptoms, progressive 
deterioration, and ocular, bulbar, respiratory, or pyramidal pattern deficits, 
and differentials for contrast-enhancing brain lesions should include primary 
brain tumors. In such cases, biopsy must proceed if the disease is of relatively 
recent onset, to facilitate diagnosis and maximize treatment opportunities.

The coexistence of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases with depression has 
long been recognised. Data that illustrate the intimate associations between 
peripheral and brain immune responses raise the possibility of shared 
pathophysiological mechanisms. These associations include the negative effects 
of proinflammatory cytokines on monoaminergic neurotransmission, neurotrophic 
factors, and measures of synaptic plasticity. The evidence supporting this 
association is accumulating and includes findings from clinical trials of 
immunomodulatory therapy, indicating that these interventions can provide 
benefits to mental health independent of improvements in physical disease 
scores. In this Review, we assess this evidence in relation to rheumatoid 
arthritis and depression, with a focus on innate immune and molecular responses 
to inflammation, and discuss the challenges of assessing causation in this 
population, acknowledging the difficulty of assessing the confounding and 
contributory effects of pain and fatigue. We also discuss how future clinical 
and preclinical research might improve diagnosis of depression in people with 
rheumatoid arthritis and shed light on mechanisms that could be substrates for 
therapeutic interventions.

Despite research progresses, the chance to accurately predict the risk for 
diabetic nephropathy (DN) is still poor. So far, the first evidence of DN is 
micro-albuminuria, which is detected only 10-20 years after the onset of 
diabetes. Our goal is to develop new predictive tools of nephropathy starting 
from urine, which can be easily obtained using noninvasive procedures and it is 
directly related to kidney. Since it is reasonable to suppose that, in 
predisposed patients, the mechanisms leading to nephropathy start acting since 
the diabetes onset, urine from children with recent diagnosis of type 1 diabetes 
was subjected to proteomic analysis in comparison to age-matched controls. 
Targeted confirmation was performed on children with a longer history of 
diabetes using Western Blotting and applying a urinary lipidomic approach. To 
definitively understand whether the observed alterations could be related to 
diabetic nephropathy, urine from diabetic adults with or without albuminuria was 
also examined. For the first time, lipid metabolisms of prostaglandin and 
ceramide, which are significantly and specifically modified in association with 
DN, are shown to be already altered in children with a recent diabetes 
diagnosis. Future studies on larger cohorts are needed to improve the validity 
and generalizability of these findings. Data are available via ProteomeXchange 
with identifier PXD011183 Submission details: Project Name: Urinary proteomics 
by 2DE and LC-MS/MS. Project accession: PXD011183 Project DOI: 
https://doi.org/10.6019/PXD011183 SIGNIFICANCE: Nephropathy is a very common 
diabetic complication. Once established, its progression can only be slowed down 
but full control or remission is achieved in very few cases, thus posing a large 
burden on worldwide health. The first evidence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is 
micro-albuminuria, but only 30% of patients with micro-albuminuria progress to 
proteinuria, while in some patients it spontaneously reverts to 
normo-albuminuria. Thus, there is clear need for biomarkers that can accurately 
predict the risk to develop DN. Herein, by applying proteomic and lipidomic 
approaches on urine samples, we show that alteration of prostaglandin and 
ceramide metabolisms specifically occurs in association with DN. Interestingly, 
we demonstrate that the modification of these metabolic pathways is an early 
event in diabetic patients, suggesting the identified changed proteins as 
possible predictive biomarkers of diabetes-induced renal function decline.

AIMS: To investigate the association between day-to-day fasting self-monitored 
blood glucose (SMBG) variability and risk of hypoglycaemia in type 1 (T1D) and 
type 2 diabetes (T2D), and to compare day-to-day fasting SMBG variability 
between treatments with insulin degludec (degludec) and insulin glargine 100 
units/mL (glargine U100).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from two double-blind, randomized, 
treat-to-target, two-period (32 weeks each) crossover trials of degludec vs 
glargine U100 in T1D (SWITCH 1, n = 501) and T2D (SWITCH 2, n = 720). Available 
fasting SMBGs were used to determine the standard deviation (SD) of day-to-day 
fasting SMBG variability for each patient and the treatment combination. The 
association between day-to-day fasting SMBG variability and overall symptomatic, 
nocturnal symptomatic and severe hypoglycaemia was analysed for the pooled 
population using linear regression, with fasting SMBG variability included as a 
three-level factor defined by population tertiles. Finally, day-to-day fasting 
SMBG variability was compared between treatments.
RESULTS: Linear regression showed that day-to-day fasting SMBG variability was 
significantly associated with overall symptomatic, nocturnal symptomatic and 
severe hypoglycaemia risk in T1D and T2D (P < 0.05). Day-to-day fasting SMBG 
variability was significantly associated (P < 0.01) with all categories of 
hypoglycaemia risk, with the exception of severe hypoglycaemia in T2D when 
analysed within tertiles. Degludec was associated with 4% lower day-to-day 
fasting SMBG variability than glargine U100 in T1D (P = 0.0082) and with 10% 
lower day-to-day fasting SMBG variability in T2D (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher day-to-day fasting SMBG variability is associated with an 
increased risk of overall symptomatic, nocturnal symptomatic and severe 
hypoglycaemia. Degludec has significantly lower day-to-day fasting SMBG 
variability vs glargine U100.

Diagnostic value of the 2017 McDonald criteria in patients with a first 
demyelinating event suggestive of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For the diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS), the revised 2017 McDonald criteria include cerebrospinal fluid 
specific oligoclonal bands as a new criterion for dissemination in time. Amongst 
other things, one expectation of the new criteria is to marginalize the 
diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), thus allowing for a faster and 
at the same time still reliable diagnosis of RRMS.
METHODS: In this study, data from an unselected patient cohort with a typical 
CIS and dissemination in space at a large German Multiple Sclerosis Center from 
2013 to 2016 were re-analysed to compare differences in diagnosing RRMS with the 
2017 versus 2010 McDonald criteria in everyday practice.
RESULTS: Out of a cohort of 290 patients presenting with a typical first 
demyelinating event, 52% (152 patients) with the diagnosis of RRMS and 48% (138 
patients) with the diagnosis of CIS according to the 2010 McDonald criteria were 
identified. The application of the 2017 McDonald criteria in the same patients 
increased the number of definite RRMS to 94% (273), thus leaving only 6% of 
patients with the diagnosis of CIS. The reason for this shift was the presence 
of cerebrospinal fluid specific oligoclonal bands which was found in 92.7% of 
the total population and in all patients with 2017 McDonald RRMS. Over a mean 
follow-up of 1.5 years, 50% of patients formerly diagnosed with CIS who are now 
RRMS also fulfilled the 2010 McDonald criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the use of the 2017 McDonald criteria for a more 
sensitive, but not that specific, diagnosis of RRMS in everyday practice.

diabetes: a review of clinical outcomes.

Dietary management has been a mainstay of care in Type 1 diabetes since before 
the discovery of insulin when severe carbohydrate restriction was advocated. The 
use of insulin facilitated re-introduction of carbohydrate into the diet. 
Current management guidelines focus on a healthy and varied diet with 
consideration of glycaemic load, protein and fat. As a result of frustration 
with glycaemic outcomes, low-carbohydrate diets have seen a resurgence in 
popularity. To date, low-carbohydrate diets have not been well studied in the 
management of Type 1 diabetes. Studies looking at glycaemic outcomes from 
low-carbohydrate diets have largely been cross-sectional, without validated 
dietary data and with a lack of control groups. The participants have been 
highly motivated self-selected individuals who follow intensive insulin 
management practices, including frequent blood glucose monitoring and additional 
insulin corrections with tight glycaemic targets. These confounders limit the 
ability to determine the extent of the impact of dietary carbohydrate 
restriction on glycaemic outcomes. Carbohydrate-containing foods including 
grains, fruit and milk are important sources of nutrients. Hence, 
low-carbohydrate diets require attention to vitamin and energy intake to avoid 
micronutrient deficiencies and growth issues. Adherence to restricted diets is 
challenging and can have an impact on social normalcy. In individuals with Type 
1 diabetes, adverse health risks such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycaemia, 
dyslipidaemia and glycogen depletion remain clinical concerns. In the present 
paper, we review studies published to date and provide clinical recommendations 
for ongoing monitoring and support for individuals who choose to adopt a 
low-carbohydrate diet. Strategies to optimize postprandial glycaemia without 
carbohydrate restriction are presented.

Many people with Type 1 diabetes struggle with the burden of self-management and 
are unable to achieve optimal glycaemic control without risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Future therapies with the potential to reduce the risk for short- and long-term 
complications while simultaneously reducing the burden of diabetes are therefore 
attractive. β-cell replacement is one strategy which might achieve this. Islet 
transplantation is limited by organ supply and the risks of long-term 
immunosuppression. Encapsulated stem-cell-derived β cells have the potential to 
address both of these issues and phase I/II clinical trials of encapsulated 
pancreatic progenitors have begun. A significant risk associated with the 
translation of stem-cell science to the clinical management of Type 1 diabetes 
is an underestimation of the complexity of the process and a mismatch between 
the hype and the expectations of both people with Type 1 diabetes and the 
public. We provide an update on progress in clinical trials of encapsulated 
stem-cell-derived β cells and propose a road map for the design and conduct of 
future trials to facilitate the translation of this exciting science to clinical 
care.

Previous systematic reviews have found a higher sero-prevalence of EBV 
antibodies in SLE patients compared with controls. Because many studies have 
been published, there is a need to apply more precise systematic review methods. 
We examined the association between EBV and SLE patients by conducting a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies that examined the 
prevalence of EBV antibodies and the DNA-positive rate. We searched the MEDLINE 
and EMBASE databases from 1966 to 2018 with no language restrictions. The 
Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) for EBV antibody sero-positivity were 
calculated, and meta-analyses were conducted. Quality assessment was performed 
using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and 33 studies were 
included. Most studies found a higher sero-prevalence of VCA IgG and EA IgG in 
SLE patients compared with controls. Meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly 
higher OR for sero-positivity to VCA IgG and EA IgG for SLE cases (2.06 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.30-3.26, p = 0.002] and 7.70, [95% CI 4.64-12.76, 
p < 0.001], respectively). The overall OR for the DNA-positive rate for SLE 
patients compared with controls was 3.86 (95% CI 1.52-9.83, p = 0.005). Other 
antibodies, i.e., VCA IgA/IgM, EBNA IgA, and EA IgA/IgM, also demonstrated a 
significant difference between SLE patients and controls. These findings support 
previous systematic reviews; however, publication bias cannot be excluded. The 
methodological conduct of studies could be improved, particularly when selecting 
controls and analyses of laboratory conduct.

OBJECTIVES: To validate in an ethnically homogeneous Greek multiple sclerosis 
(MS) cohort, genetic risk factors for the disease, identified through a number 
of previous multi-ethnic genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
METHODS: A total of 1228 MS cases and 1014 controls were recruited in the study, 
from 3 MS centers in Greece. We genotyped 35 susceptibility SNPs that emerged 
from previous GWAS or meta-analyses of GWAS. Allele and genotype single locus 
regression analysis, adjusted for gender and site, was performed. Permutation 
testing was applied to all analyses.
RESULTS: Six polymorphisms reached statistical significance (permutation p value 
< 0.05). In particular, rs2760524 of LOC105371664, near RGS1 (permutation p 
value 0.001), rs3129889 of HLA-DRA, near HLA-DRB1 (permutation p value 
< 1.00e-04), rs1738074 of TAGAP (permutation p value 0.007), rs703842 of 
METTL1/CYP27B1 (permutation p value 0.008), rs9596270 of DLEU1 (permutation p 
value < 1.00e-04), and rs17445836 of LincRNA, near IRF8 (permutation p value 
0.001) were identified as susceptibility risk factors in our group.
CONCLUSION: The current study replicated a number of GWAS susceptibility SNPs, 
which implies that some similarities between the examined Greek population and 
the MS genetic architecture of the GWAS populations do exist.

Stronger adaptive immune responses in females can be observed in different 
mammals, resulting in better control of infections compared to males. However, 
this presumably evolutionary difference likely also drives higher incidence of 
autoimmune diseases observed in humans. Here, we summarize sex differences in 
the most common autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and 
discuss recent advances in the understanding of possible underlying 
immunological and CNS intrinsic mechanisms. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the most 
common inflammatory disease of the CNS, but also in rarer conditions, such as 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) or neuronal 
autoantibody-mediated autoimmune encephalitis (AE), sex is one of the top risk 
factors, with women being more often affected than men. Immunological mechanisms 
driving the sex bias in autoimmune CNS diseases are complex and include hormonal 
as well as genetic and epigenetic effects, which could also be exerted 
indirectly via modulation of the microbiome. Furthermore, CNS intrinsic 
differences could underlie the sex bias in autoimmunity by differential 
responses to injury. The strong effects of sex on incidence and possibly also 
activity and progression of autoimmune CNS disorders suggest that treatments 
need to be tailored to each sex to optimize efficacy. To date, however, due to a 
lack of systematic studies on treatment responses in males versus females, 
evidence in this area is still sparse. We argue that studies taking sex 
differences into account could pave the way for sex-specific and therefore 
personalized treatment.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a new class of anticancer drugs recently 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of 
various malignancies. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that 
targets the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell 
death ligand-2 (PD-L2). Pembrolizumab was first approved by the FDA in 2014 for 
the treatment of advanced melanoma and is currently approved for use in 
non-small cell lung cancer and several other neoplasms. Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have been reported to induce immune-mediated 
side effects, including type 1 diabetes mellitus in very rare cases (0.1% in 
clinical trials). Here, we report the case of a woman with no known history of 
diabetes who presented to our emergency department in a state of diabetic 
ketoacidosis within 3 weeks of receiving only a single dose of pembrolizumab 
therapy, and without any previous exposure to immunotherapy. This case of abrupt 
adult-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus is an example of the undesirable side 
effects that can emerge after only a brief exposure to an immune checkpoint 
inhibitor. Close monitoring of patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors 
is warranted for the early diagnosis and management of imminent and potentially 
life-threatening complications.

In recent years, ultra-high field MRI (7 T and above) has received more interest 
for clinical imaging. Indeed, a number of studies have shown the benefits from 
the application of this powerful tool not only for research purposes, but also 
in realms of improved diagnostics and patient management. The increased 
signal-to-noise ratio and higher spatial resolution compared with conventional 
and high-field clinical scanners allow imaging of small anatomical detail and 
subtle pathological findings. Furthermore, greater spectral resolution achieved 
at ultra-high field allows the resolution of metabolites for MR spectroscopic 
imaging. All these advantages have a significant impact on many neurological 
diseases, including multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular disease, brain tumors, 
epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases, in part because the pathology can be 
subtle and lesions small in these diseases, therefore having higher signal and 
resolution will help lesion detection. In this review, we discuss the main 
clinical neurological applications and some technical challenges which remain 
with ultra-high field MRI.

BACKGROUND: Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) with a 
peak incidence between 30 and 50 years of age. Although children and adolescents 
may also develop the disease, the genetic background of paediatric-onset GD 
(POGD) remains largely unknown. Here, we looked for similarities and differences 
in the genetic risk factors for POGD and adult-onset GD (AOGD) as well as for 
variants associated with age of GD onset.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1267 GD patients and 1054 healthy controls 
were included in the study. Allele frequencies of 40 established and suggested 
GD/AITD genetic risk variants (39 SNPs and HLA-DRB1*03) were compared between 
POGD (N = 179), AOGD (N = 1088) and healthy controls. Subsequently, multiple 
linear regression was used to explore the relationship between age of GD onset 
and genotype for each locus.
RESULTS: We identified six POGD risk loci, all of them were also strongly 
associated with AOGD. Although for some of the analysed variants, including HCP5 
(rs3094228), PRICKLE1 (rs4768412) and SCGB3A2 (rs1368408), allele frequencies 
differed nominally between POGD and AOGD patients, these differences were not 
significant after applying multiple testing correction (Pcor  
= 0.05/40 = 1.25 × 10-3 ). Regression analysis showed that patients with higher 
number of HCP5 risk alleles tend to have a significantly earlier onset of GD 
(P = 6.9 × 10-5 ).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study revealed that POGD and AOGD share multiple 
common genetic risk variants. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that 
HCP5 polymorphism is associated with an earlier age of GD onset in a 
dose-dependent manner.

OBJECTIVES: Rituximab (RTX) may be a treatment option for children and young 
people with JIA, although it is not licensed for this indication. The aim of 
this study was to describe RTX use and outcomes among children with JIA.
METHODS: This analysis included all JIA patients within the UK Biologics for 
Children with Rheumatic Diseases study starting RTX. Disease activity was 
assessed at RTX start and at follow-up. The total number of courses each patient 
received was assessed. Serious infections and infusion reactions occurring 
following RTX were reported.
RESULTS: Forty-one JIA patients starting RTX were included, the majority with 
polyarthritis: polyarthritis RF negative [n = 14 (35%)], polyarthritis RF 
positive [n = 13 (33%)] and extended oligoarthritis [n = 9 (23%)]. Most were 
female (80%) with a median age of 15 years [interquartile range (IQR) 12-16] and 
a median disease duration of 9 years (IQR 5-11). The median improvement in the 
clinical Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (cJADAS; three-variable 
71-joint JADAS) from RTX start was 9 units (n = 7; IQR -14-2). More than half 
reported more than one course of RTX. The median time between each course was 
219 days (IQR 198-315). During follow-up, 17 (41%) patients reported switching 
to another biologic, including tocilizumab (n = 8), abatacept (n = 6) and TNF 
inhibitor (n = 3). Three patients (7%) reported a serious infection on RTX (rate 
of first serious infection 6.2/100 person-years). Four patients (10%) reported 
an infusion reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: This real-world cohort of children with JIA, the majority with 
polyarticular or extended oligoarticular JIA, showed RTX may be an effective 
treatment option for children who do not respond to TNF inhibitor, with a low 
rate of serious infections on treatment.

BACKGROUND: Anti-DNA/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2 (NR2) antibodies 
(anti-DNA/NR2 antibodies) are a subset of anti-DNA autoantibodies that 
cross-react with the extracellular domain of the GluN2A/GluN2B subunits of NR2. 
These antibodies induce apoptosis of hippocampus neurons and psychiatric 
disorder in mice and humans. Neuropsychiatric system lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) 
can develop after initiation of corticosteroids (post-steroid neuropsychiatric 
manifestation: PSNP) or before treatment (de novo NPSLE); however, 
pathophysiological differences between these subtypes remain unclear. The 
objective of this study was to clarify the prevalence of anti-DNA/NR2 antibodies 
in patients with NPSLE.
METHODS: This study involved a cohort of patients with NPSLE admitted to our 
hospital. NPSLE patients were classified into two groups, de novo NPSLE and 
PSNP-SLE. Serum anti-DNA antibodies and anti-DNA/NR2 antibodies were measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
RESULTS: Serum samples were obtained from 24 patients with de novo NPSLE, 25 
with PSNP-SLE and 76 healthy controls (HC). The level of anti-DNA/NR2 antibodies 
in patients with de novo NPSLE and PSNP-SLE were also higher than those in HC. 
Positive correlation between anti-DNA antibodies and anti-DNA/NR2 antibodies 
were found in PSNP-SLE, but was not significant in de novo NPSLE.
CONCLUSION: The levels of anti-DNA/NR2 antibodies in PSNP-SLE were similar to 
those in de novo NPSLE. Anti-DNA/NR2 antibodies in PSNP-SLE were suggested as a 
dominant subset of anti-DNA antibodies, indicating that anti-DNA/NR2 antibodies 
may be a predictive factor in PSNP-SLE.

BACKGROUND: Most perioperative diabetes mellitus (DM) guidelines do not 
distinguish between patients with type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2). We hypothesised 
that similar treatment of DM1 and DM2 patients leads to differences in their 
perioperative glucose control.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study, of all DM patients 
undergoing surgery between May 2013 and November 2015 in a Dutch university 
hospital. We compared DM1 with DM2 patients, treated according to the same 
perioperative glucose protocol. Our primary outcome was the incidence of 
hyperglycaemia (glucose ≥10 mmol/L). Secondary outcomes were short-term 
glycaemic control (glucose before surgery and peak glucose perioperatively), 
long-term glycaemic control (HbA1c in 90 days before and after surgery) and the 
incidence of hypoglycaemia (glucose <4 mmol/L).
RESULTS: We included 2259 patients with DM, 216 (10%) of which had DM1. The 
calculated incidences in our population were 7 out of 1000 patients with DM1 and 
69 out of 1000 patients with DM2. Compared to those with DM2, patients with DM1 
were younger, had a lower BMI, a higher glucose concentration before surgery, 
and a higher perioperative peak glucose concentration (11.0 [8.2-14.7] vs 9.4 
[7.7-11.7], P < 0.001). The incidence of the primary endpoint, perioperative 
hyperglycaemia, was significantly higher in DM1 compared to DM2 patients (63% vs 
43%, P < 0.001). Hypoglycaemia occurred more often in the DM1 population (7.1% 
vs 1.3%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Providing similar perioperative treatment to patients with DM1 and 
DM2 is associated with poorer short-term and long-term glycaemic control in DM1 
throughout the perioperative period as well as an increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia.

To study the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) on the 
differentiation of T cells and the levels of cytokines in patients with early 
rheumatoid arthritis (eRA). The levels of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells were 
detected with BDFACS Calibur flow cytometer. The expression of IFN-ɤ, TNF-α, 
IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and IL-22 was examined in 54 patients with eRA 
using a cytometric bead array (CBA). After 72 h of incubation of PBMCs from eRA 
patients with 1,25(OH)2D3, the levels of IFN-ɤ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17 
significantly decreased compared to those of the control. 1,25(OH)2D3 had no 
significantly impact on the levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-22. The proportion of 
Th17 and the ratio of Th17/Treg significantly decreased in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated 
groups compared to those of the control. 1,25(OH)2D3 had no significantly impact 
on the proportion of Th1, Th2, Treg, and the ratio of Th1/Th2. Although no 
statistically significant difference was observed, proportion of Th1 was 
decreased after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment compared with anti-CD3/CD28 only. The 
present study demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the synthesis of specific 
cytokines: Th1 (IFN-ɤ) and Th17 (IL-17, IL-22, IL-6, TNF-α) might upregulated 
Th2 cytokine (IL-4), which indicated the possible immunoregulatory roles and 
bone-sparing effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in eRA through modulation of the Th1 and 
Th17 cytokine balance.

The role of obesity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains controversial. 
Studies have linked adiposity with a heightened risk of clinical complications 
including neurocognitive decline, renal impairment, dampened physical activity, 
and depressed quality of life-but not disease activity. We aimed to reexamine 
whether obesity in SLE patients independently associates with higher disease 
activity. Adult patients with SLE were recruited from the longitudinal, 
multi-ethnic Southern California Lupus Registry (SCOLR). Disease status was 
ascertained by calculating SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), which was then 
statistically analyzed for association with increased body mass index (BMI) by 
univariable and multivariable regression analyses. One hundred and thirty-seven 
patients were included in the study; 37% were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Obesity 
was significantly associated with SLEDAI (P = 0.026) and current steroid use 
(P = 0.029). Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that obesity 
remained independently associated with lupus activity (OR 2.335, P = 0.026). In 
a representative sample of patients with SLE, obesity independently associated 
with worse SLE disease activity. Obesity may therefore be an important target 
for improving SLE outcomes.

AIMS: Type 1 diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity 
and mortality, and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is an important CV 
risk factor. The study aimed to explore associations between CAN and altered 
cardiac chamber sizes in persons with type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 71 asymptomatic, normoalbuminuric 
participants with long-term type 1 diabetes (39 with CAN, determined by >1 
abnormal autonomic function test) examined with cardiac multi detector computed 
tomography scans, which allowed measurements of left ventricular mass and all 
four cardiac chamber volumes. Cardiac chambers were indexed according to body 
surface area (ml/m2 or g/m2).
RESULTS: Persons with and without CAN had mean ± SD age of 57 ± 7 and 
50 ± 8 years (p < 0.001) and diabetes duration of 36 ± 11 and 32 ± 9 years 
(p < 0.05), respectively. Increasing autonomic dysfunction, evaluated by 
decrease in heart rate variability during deep breathing (in beats per minute), 
was associated with larger right (-0.5, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.0, p < 0.05) and trend 
towards larger left (-0.4, 95% CI -0.8-0.0, p < 0.1) ventricular volumes in 
multivariable linear regression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that impaired autonomic function may be 
associated with modest enlargement of ventricular volumes; this might be an 
early sign of progression towards heart failure.

Specific Sports Habits, Leisure-Time Physical Activity, and School-Educational 
Physical Activity in Children With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Patterns and 
Barriers.

Nørgaard M(1), Herlin T(1).

(1)Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.

OBJECTIVE: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) may cause functional impairment 
and reduced time engaged in physical activity. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the habits of patients with JIA regarding participation in club 
sports, leisure-time physical activity, and school-educational physical activity 
and relate this to objectively measured physical activity using accelerometry 
and to compare the findings with those in healthy controls.
METHODS: Consecutive patients from the Aarhus University Hospital outpatient 
clinic were included. Clinical characteristics, functional ability, and 
exploration of specific habits in club sports, leisure-time physical activity, 
and school-educational physical activity (based on a standardized questionnaire) 
in patients were recorded and compared with those in healthy controls. The 
intensity and frequency of physical activity were measured by accelerometer 
monitoring, using ActiGraph GT1M.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients with JIA and 118 healthy control subjects were 
included. Despite having low disease activity, children with JIA had 
significantly lower accelerometry-monitored physical activity levels compared 
with healthy controls. The distribution of specific club sport activities was 
the same among patients and controls. However, the proportion of patients 
spending >3 hours/week participating in club sports was significantly lower than 
the proportion of controls, whereas no difference in time spent engaging in 
physical activity during leisure-time was observed. Participation in compulsory 
school-educational physical activity was equally high in patients and controls, 
although participation by patients was significantly less consistent than that 
by controls. Patient reports of time spent with club sport and leisure-time 
physical activity was significantly related to accelerometry measures, whereas 
this was not observed for school-educational physical activity.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate the need for structured guidance 
for all patients with JIA (including those with minimal disease activity) in 
both understanding and coping with the consequences of a low level of physical 
activity.

The use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) for translational research can be 
challenging due to difficulty in extracting accurate disease phenotype data. 
Historically, EHR algorithms for annotating phenotypes have been either 
rule-based or trained with billing codes and gold standard labels curated via 
labor intensive medical chart review. These simplistic algorithms tend to have 
unpredictable portability across institutions and low accuracy for many disease 
phenotypes due to imprecise billing codes. Recently, more sophisticated machine 
learning algorithms have been developed to improve the robustness and accuracy 
of EHR phenotyping algorithms. These algorithms are typically trained via 
supervised learning, relating gold standard labels to a wide range of candidate 
features including billing codes, procedure codes, medication prescriptions and 
relevant clinical concepts extracted from narrative notes via Natural Language 
Processing (NLP). However, due to the time intensiveness of gold standard 
labeling, the size of the training set is often insufficient to build a 
generalizable algorithm with the large number of candidate features extracted 
from EHR. To reduce the number of candidate predictors and in turn improve model 
performance, we present an automated feature selection method based entirely on 
unlabeled observations. The proposed method generates a comprehensive surrogate 
for the underlying phenotype with an unsupervised clustering of disease status 
based on several highly predictive features such as diagnosis codes and mentions 
of the disease in text fields available in the entire set of EHR data. A sparse 
regression model is then built with the estimated outcomes and remaining 
covariates to identify those features most informative of the phenotype of 
interest. Relying on the results of Li and Duan (1989), we demonstrate that 
variable selection for the underlying phenotype model can be achieved by fitting 
the surrogate-based model. We explore the performance of our methods in 
numerical simulations and present the results of a prediction model for 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) built on a large EHR data mart from the Partners 
Health System consisting of billing codes and NLP terms. Empirical results 
suggest that our procedure reduces the number of gold-standard labels necessary 
for phenotyping thereby harnessing the automated power of EHR data and improving 
efficiency.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and degenerative disease of the 
central nervous system (CNS) with a strong inflammatory component that affects 
more than 2 million people worldwide (and at least 400,000 in the United 
States). In MS, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and D-dopachrome 
tautomerase (D-DT) enhance the inflammatory event as a result of their 
interaction with their cognate receptor CD74. Therefore, the search for new 
agents aimed at blocking this interaction is critical for therapeutic purposes 
and will be of paramount importance for the treatment of MS. DRα1-MOG-35-55 
constructs have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) a mouse model for MS. This 
effect is directly correlated with the binding to its cell surface receptor, 
CD74, apparently preventing or blocking the binding of two inflammatory factors, 
MIF and D-DT. Here we report that a single amino acid substitution (L50Q) in the 
DRα1 domain of the human and mouse DRα1-MOG-35-55 constructs (notated as DRhQ 
and DRmQ, respectively) possessed increased affinity for CD74, a greater 
capacity to block MIF binding, the ability to inhibit pERK1/2 signaling and 
increased therapeutic activity in mice with EAE. These data suggest that binding 
affinity for CD74 could serve as an in vitro indicator of biological potency of 
DRhQ and thus support its possible clinical utility as an effective therapy for 
MS and perhaps other diseases in which there is an inflammatory reaction driven 
by MIF and D-DT.

The retention rate of a biological drug (percentage of patients remaining on 
treatment over time) provides an index of a drug's overall effectiveness. The 
golimumab retention rate as first-line biological therapy was high in clinical 
trial extensions lasting 5 years. Real-world studies also indicate good 
retention rates but have been of shorter duration. The probability of retention 
with golimumab treatment was assessed, as any line of anti-tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha therapy, for up to 5 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), associated 
factors were analyzed. A retrospective database analysis of the Spanish registry 
of patients with rheumatic disorders receiving biological drugs (BIOBADASER) was 
performed. Among 353 patients, 29.8% had RA, 41.6% SpA and 28.6% PsA. Golimumab 
was the first biological drug in 40.1% of patients, second in 30.1% and 
third/later in 29.8%. The overall probability of retention of golimumab at years 
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 was 85.9% (95% confidence interval 81.4-89.5%), 73.7% 
(67.1-79.1%), 68.5% (60.5-75.1%), 60.6% (50.2-69.5%) and 57.1% (44.9-67.5%), 
respectively. Retention was similar across indications (p = 0.070) but was 
greater when golimumab was used as the first biological agent compared with 
later therapy lines (p < 0.001). Factors associated with higher retention of 
golimumab treatment (Cox regression) were use as a first-line biological and 
concomitant methotrexate treatment; corticosteroid need was associated with 
lower retention. The long-term probability of golimumab retention was high in 
this real-world study of patients with rheumatic diseases, especially when used 
as the first biological drug.

OBJECTIVE: Progression to insulin therapy in clinically diagnosed type 2 
diabetes is highly variable. GAD65 autoantibodies (GADA) are associated with 
faster progression, but their predictive value is limited. We aimed to determine 
if a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1D GRS) could predict rapid 
progression to insulin treatment over and above GADA testing.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the relationship between T1D GRS, GADA 
(negative or positive), and rapid insulin requirement (within 5 years) using 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression in 8,608 participants with 
clinical type 2 diabetes (onset >35 years and treated without insulin for ≥6 
months). T1D GRS was both analyzed continuously (as standardized scores) and 
categorized based on previously reported centiles of a population with type 1 
diabetes (<5th [low], 5th-50th [medium], and >50th [high]).
RESULTS: In GADA-positive participants (3.3%), those with higher T1D GRS 
progressed to insulin more quickly: probability of insulin requirement at 5 
years (95% CI): 47.9% (35.0%, 62.78%) (high T1D GRS) vs. 27.6% (20.5%, 36.5%) 
(medium T1D GRS) vs. 17.6% (11.2%, 27.2%) (low T1D GRS); P = 0.001. In contrast, 
T1D GRS did not predict rapid insulin requirement in GADA-negative participants 
(P = 0.4). In Cox regression analysis with adjustment for age of diagnosis, BMI, 
and cohort, T1D GRS was independently associated with time to insulin only in 
the presence of GADA: hazard ratio per SD increase was 1.48 (1.15, 1.90); P = 
0.002.
CONCLUSIONS: A T1D GRS alters the clinical implications of a positive GADA test 
in patients with clinical type 2 diabetes and is independent of and additive to 
clinical features.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oral or intravenous methylprednisolone (≥500 mg/day for 
5 days) is recommended for multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. Nonetheless, the 
optimal dose remains uncertain. We compared clinical and radiological 
effectiveness, safety and quality of life (QoL) of oral methylprednisolone 
[1250 mg/day (standard high dose)] versus 625 mg/day (lesser high dose), both 
for 3 days] in MS relapses.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients with moderate to severe MS relapse within the 
previous 15 days were randomized in a pilot, double-blind, multicentre, 
non-inferiority trial (ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT01986998). The primary endpoint was 
non-inferiority of the lesser high dose by Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS) score improvement on day 30 (non-inferiority margin, 1 point). The 
secondary endpoints were EDSS score change on days 7 and 90, changes in T1 
gadolinium-enhanced and new/enlarged T2 lesions on days 7 and 30, and safety and 
QoL results.
RESULTS: The primary outcome was achieved [mean (95% confidence interval) EDSS 
score difference, -0.26 (-0.7 to 0.18) at 30 days (P = 0.246)]. The standard 
high dose yielded a superior EDSS score improvement on day 7 (P = 0.028). No 
differences were observed in EDSS score on day 90 (P = 0.352) or in the number 
of T1 gadolinium-enhanced or new/enlarged T2 lesions on day 7 (P = 0.401, 0.347) 
or day 30 (P = 0.349, 0.529). Safety and QoL were good at both doses.
CONCLUSIONS: A lesser high-dose oral methylprednisolone regimen may not be 
inferior to the standard high dose in terms of clinical and radiological 
response.

AIM: To characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 
dasiglucagon, a novel, stable and liquid formulated glucagon analogue, during 
hypoglycaemic and euglycaemic conditions in adult patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized double-blind trial, 17 patients 
received four single subcutaneous doses (0.03, 0.08, 0.2 and 0.6 mg) of 
dasiglucagon (4 mg/mL formulation) under euglycaemic (plasma glucose [PG] 5.6 
mmol/L [100 mg/dL]) or hypoglycaemic (PG 3.1-3.7 mmol/L [56-66 mg/dL]) 
conditions. For comparison, three doses (0.03, 0.08 and 0.2 mg) of a commercial 
glucagon formulation (Eli Lilly) were investigated at euglycaemia.
RESULTS: Dasiglucagon led to a dose-dependent and rapid increase in PG levels 
across all doses tested (mean increases 30 minutes post-dosing of 2.2 to 4.4 
mmol/L [39-80 mg/dL] from euglycaemia and 1.3 to 5.2 mmol/L [24-94 mg/dL] from 
hypoglycaemia), which was higher than the rises elicited by similar doses of 
commercial glucagon (1.7-3.9 mmol/L [30-71 mg/dL]). The median time (range) to 
an increase in PG of >1.1 mmol/L (20 mg/dL) was <20 (18-19.5) minutes with 0.03 
mg dasiglucagon and, with higher doses, the median times ranged from 9 to 15 
minutes (commercial glucagon 13-14 minutes). In hypoglycaemia, 0.03 and 0.08 mg 
dasiglucagon re-established normoglycaemia (PG ≥3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]) within 
median times of 14 and 10 minutes, respectively. Nausea and vomiting occurred 
more frequently with dasiglucagon than with commercial glucagon at identical 
doses which might be attributable to dasiglucagon's higher potency.
CONCLUSION: Dasiglucagon rapidly increased PG at doses of 0.03 to 0.6 mg in a 
dose-dependent manner and, therefore, is a good candidate for use in 
dual-hormone artificial pancreas systems.

BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease 
associated with preexisting comorbidities and higher mortality. The interest in 
using therapy other than oral steroids in BP management results from severe 
complications and increased risk of death. The efficacy of oral doxycycline or 
whole-body application of topical clobetasol has been proven in randomized 
controlled trials. The case series study suggested that combination of 
tetracycline, nicotinamide, and lesionally administered clobetasol may also be 
useful.
METHODS: We conducted a clinical 3-year retrospective study of treatment with 
tetracycline, nicotinamide, and lesionally administered clobetasol (TNC) in 
comparison to prednisone (P). Out of 106 patients (mean age 78 ± 9.9 years) with 
newly diagnosed BP, 59 received tetracycline 1.5 g/daily, nicotinamide 1.2 
g/daily, and 0.05% lesionally administered clobetasol cream, and 47 patients - 
prednisone 0.5 mg/kg daily.
RESULTS: The median time to disease control was achieved after 7 days in both 
groups. At 4 weeks, 93.2% of patients treated with TNC and 89.1% from P group 
achieved disease control. The median period between complete remission and 
relapse was 60 days in the TNC group and 90 days in the P group (P = 0.84). At 
least one relapse within 1 year was noted in 32.1% of patients from the TNC 
group and 50% from the P group (P = 0.09). The 1-year survival for the TNC and P 
groups was 83% and 65.9%, respectively (P = 0.04), and the 3-year survival was 
71.2% and 48% (P = 0.019), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Tetracycline and nicotinamide combined with lesionally administered 
clobetasol is an alternative, effective treatment with better survival rates 
compared to prednisone in BP.

OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests that aberrant function of innate lymphoid cells 
(ILCs), whose functional and transcriptional profiles overlap with those of Th 
cell subsets, contributes to immune-mediated pathologies. To date, analysis of 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) immune pathology has concentrated on the 
contribution of CD4+ T cells; we have previously identified an expansion of Th17 
cells within the synovial fluid (SF) of JIA patients. We undertook this study to 
extend this analysis to further investigate the role of ILCs and other 
interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing T cell subsets in JIA.
METHODS: ILCs and CD3+ T cell subsets were defined in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy adults, healthy children, and JIA 
patients and in SF mononuclear cells (SFMCs) from JIA patients using flow 
cytometry. Defined subsets in SFMCs were correlated with clinical measures 
including physician's global assessment of disease activity on a visual analog 
scale, number of joints with active disease, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 
Transcription factor and cytokine profiles of sorted ILCs were assessed by 
quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Group 1 ILCs (ILC1s), NKp44- group 3 ILCs (natural cytotoxicity 
receptor-negative [NCR-] ILC3s), and NKp44+ ILC3s (NCR+ ILC3s) were enriched in 
JIA SFMCs compared to PBMCs, which corresponded to an increase in transcripts 
for TBX21, IFNG, and IL17A. Of the ILC subsets, the frequency of NCR- ILC3s in 
JIA SFMCs displayed the strongest positive association with clinical measures, 
which was mirrored by an expansion in IL-17A+CD4+, IL-17A+CD8+, and IL-17A+ γδ T 
cells.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that the strength of the IL-17A signature in JIA 
SFMCs is determined by multiple lymphoid cell types, including NCR- ILC3s and 
IL-17A+CD4+, IL-17A+CD8+, and IL-17A+ γδ T cells. These observations may have 
important implications for the development of stratified therapeutics.

Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used as a disease modifying agent in 
relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis. It has not previously been 
associated with drug induced liver injury. Here we present a case of a 49 year 
old female developing drug induced liver injury secondary to alemtuzumab, 
confirmed upon rechallenge. Our patient developed severe hepatitis within two 
days of starting alemtuzumab, both initially and upon rechallenge. The alanine 
aminotransferase peaked at 577 units per litre and 426 units per litre after 
initial dose of alemtuzumab and rechallenge respectively. The patient's liver 
function tests improved significantly between doses of alemtuzumab and again 
normalised within three months of the second dose, with no clinical 
manifestations of acute hepatic failure. A full hepatitis screen ruled out 
alternative causes of hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis and 
hepatotoxicity relating to other medications. Deliberate rechallenge with a 
medication thought to be associated with drug induced liver injury is uncommonly 
performed but provides substantial evidence for causality in the appropriate 
clinical context. The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method score was 
calculated as nine, indicating that drug induced liver injury due to alemtuzumab 
is highly probable. Drug induced liver injury is a potentially serious condition 
that should be monitored for during alemtuzumab treatment of relapsing and 
remitting multiple sclerosis. The role of a rechallenge should be weighed up on 
a case by case basis.

Therapeutic use of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is effective, and 
generally safe. Nevertheless, iatrogenic botulism (IB) is rarely reported as a 
result of systemic spread of the BoNT/A, causing general weakness, bulbar 
symptoms and dysautonomia. Suggestive clinical feature are decisive to raise the 
diagnostic suspicion, which however needs a confirmation in the 
electrodiagnostic (EDX) study, above all to exclude other treatable diseases. In 
this study, we report 2 patients who developed IB after receiving therapeutic 
doses of BoNT/A, assessing the EDX changes, and reviewing the literature on EDX 
in IB. Although there is not enough data to draw solid conclusions we propose 
that, in a subject with suggestive clinical features and recent exposure to 
BoNT/A, the absence of a decremental or incremental response to repetitive nerve 
stimulation in muscles showing acute denervation changes, is a suggestive 
finding for the diagnosis of IB.

inhibitors for cancer: 68 cases from the Food and Drug Administration database 
and review.

BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) are widely used in modern 
oncology and have improved the prognosis of lung cancer, malignant melanoma, and 
other malignancies. Unlike cytotoxic chemotherapy, drugs such as nivolumab, 
pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab are associated with immune-related adverse 
effects. We recently observed a patient with lung cancer who developed a 
fulminant warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).
OBJECTIVES: Investigate the frequency and prognosis of AIHA secondary to CPI in 
a public database and review the literature.
RESULTS: A total of 68 cases were identified in the database of the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), 43 were associated with nivolumab, 13 with 
pembrolizumab, seven with ipilimumab, and five with atezolizumab. All episodes 
of AIHA were listed as serious. If the total number of adverse events cases 
reported to the FDA is taken as a reference, AIHA is rare, but occurred more 
frequently with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents (0.15%-0.25%) than with CTLA-4 
inhibitors (0.06%). In addition to our case, the literature review identified 11 
similar cases. Most cases of AIHA responded to steroids, but two of 12 were 
fatal.
CONCLUSION: We describe AIHA as a new and serious immune-related side effect of 
CPI. Early aggressive management is necessary.

12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) is one of several enzyme isoforms responsible for the 
metabolism of arachidonic acid and other poly-unsaturated fatty acids to both 
pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators. Mounting evidence has shown that 
12-LOX plays a critical role in the modulation of inflammation at multiple 
checkpoints during diabetes development. Due to this, interventions to limit 
pro-inflammatory 12-LOX metabolites either by isoform-specific 12-LOX 
inhibition, or by providing specific fatty acid substrates via dietary 
intervention, has the potential to significantly and positively impact health 
outcomes of patients living with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. To date, the 
development of truly specific and efficacious inhibitors has been hampered by 
homology of LOX family members; however, improvements in high throughput 
screening have improved the inhibitor landscape. Here, we describe the function 
and role of human 12-LOX, and mouse 12-LOX and 12/15-LOX, in the development of 
diabetes and diabetes-related complications, and describe promise in the 
development of strategies to limit pro-inflammatory metabolites, primarily via 
new small molecule 12-LOX inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: Ljungan virus (LV) has not confirmed to associate with any human 
disease, but a possible connection with type 1 diabetes has been suggested. LV 
is a rodent-borne picornavirus that induces a diabetes-like condition in 
rodents. Approximately 30% of adults and 60% of children are seropositive in 
Finland. The Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study enabled the 
use of very well characterized sample panels from children seroconverted to 
positivity for multiple islet autoantibodies during their prospective 
observation from birth; in addition, samples from age, sex, human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA), and residence area matched control children.
METHODS: We analyzed LV IgG seroprevalence in 102 case children (65 had also 
developed type 1 diabetes), in addition to nondiabetic control children. LV and 
human parechovirus (HPeV) immunofluorescence assays were used to analyze LV and 
HPeV-specific IgG from 102 plasma samples taken at the time of islet 
autoantibody appearance and from 204 samples from the matched control children.
RESULTS: Altogether 46.1% of the case and 50.7% of the control children were 
positive for LV IgG (odds ratio 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-1.36; P = 
0.416) and 67.6% versus 79.8% were positive for HPeV IgG, respectively (odds 
ratio 0.49, 0.27-0.9, P = 0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, no risk associations between LV or HPeV-specific IgG and 
islet autoimmunity were observed. However, a trend for significantly higher 
prevalence of HPeV antibodies in control children (P = 0.023) suggests a 
possible protective association of this virus with islet autoimmunity.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to establish the association between 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-defined glycaemic variability (GV) and 
cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in type 1 diabetes independent of mean 
glucose and to examine the relative contribution of each internationally 
standardized CGM parameter to this association.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 80 adults with type 1 diabetes who 
underwent 3-day CGM and autonomic function tests within 3 months. The degree of 
association between internationally standardized CGM parameters and CAN, defined 
as at least two abnormal parasympathetic tests or the presence of orthostatic 
hypotension, were analysed by logistic regression, receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC), and dominance analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 36 subjects (45.0%) were diagnosed with CAN. When adjusted 
with mean glucose and clinical risk factors of CAN, standard deviation, 
coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion, percent time in 
level 1 (glucose 54-69 mg/dL) and level 2 (glucose < 54 mg/dL) hypoglycaemia, 
area under the curve in level 2 hypoglycaemia, low blood glucose index, high 
blood glucose index, and percent time in glucose 70 to 180 mg/dL were 
independently associated with CAN. Multivariable ROC analysis and dominance 
analysis revealed the highest relative contribution of percent time in level 2 
hypoglycaemia to the independent associations between CGM parameters and 
presence of CAN.
CONCLUSIONS: CGM-defined GV was associated with CAN independent of mean glucose 
in adults with type 1 diabetes. Among internationally standardized CGM 
parameters, those describing the degree of level 2 hypoglycaemia were the most 
significant contributors to this association.

Adolescents with type 1 diabetes may be at elevated risk for somatic problems. 
This study used cross-sectional, baseline data from an intervention to examine 
if problems with executive function (EF) were associated with greater somatic 
problems independent of poor adherence and disease severity in adolescents with 
type 1 diabetes and above target glycemic control. In addition, it examined 
whether certain types of EF skills, that is, metacognitive and behavior 
regulation, accounted for variance in somatic problems. Ninety-three adolescents 
completed a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) blood test and parents completed 
adherence, somatic problems, and EF questionnaires, which measured 
metacognitive, behavior regulation, and global EF. Greater somatic problems had 
significant bivariate associations with greater global (r = 0.42, P < 0.01), 
metacognitive (r = 0.43, P < 0.01), and behavior regulation EF problems 
(r = 0.31, P < 0.01), worse adherence (r = -0.39, P < 0.01), and poorer 
metabolic control (r = 0.26, P < 0.05). However, when adherence, metabolic 
control, and EF subscales were examined together in the same model, only greater 
global EF problems (b = 0.15, P < 0.01) and metacognitive EF problems (b = 0.16, 
P < 0.01) were independently associated with greater somatic problems; behavior 
regulation EF problems were not independently associated with greater somatic 
problems when controlling for adherence. Metacognitive EF problems may predict 
somatic problems in adolescents with above target glycemic control above and 
beyond physical symptoms related to disease management, underscoring the 
importance of proper assessment and treatment of these distinct somatic 
problems.

BACKGROUND: Bone remodeling is a lifelong process due to the balanced activity 
of osteoclasts (OCs), the bone-reabsorbing cells, and osteoblasts (OBs), and the 
bone-forming cells. This equilibrium is regulated by numerous cytokines, but it 
has been largely demonstrated that the RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin and 
Wnt/β-catenin pathways play a key role in the control of osteoclastogenesis and 
osteoblastogenesis, respectively. The pro-osteoblastogenic activity of the 
Wnt/β-catenin can be inhibited by sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1). RANKL, 
sclerostin and DKKs-1 are often up-regulated in bone diseases, and they are the 
target of new monoclonal antibodies.
DATA SOURCES: The authors performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and 
EMBASE to June 2018, reviewed and selected articles, based on pre-determined 
selection criteria.
RESULTS: We re-evaluated the role of RANKL, osteoprotegerin, sclerostin and 
DKK-1 in altered bone remodeling associated with some inherited and acquired 
pediatric diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), alkaptonuria (AKU), 
hemophilia A, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OH-D) 
and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). To do so, we considered recent clinical studies 
done on pediatric patients in which the roles of RANKL-RANK/osteoprotegerin and 
WNT-ß-catenin signaling pathways have been investigated, and for which 
innovative therapies for the treatment of osteopenia/osteoporosis are being 
developed.
CONCLUSIONS: The case studies taken into account for this review demonstrated 
that quite frequently both bone reabsorbing and bone deposition are impaired in 
pediatric diseases. Furthermore, for some of them, bone damage began in 
childhood but only manifested with age. The use of denosumab could represent a 
valid alternative therapeutic approach to improve bone health in children, 
although further studies need to be carried out.

PURPOSE: The disease course of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unpredictable, and 
reliable prognostic biomarkers are needed. Positron emission tomography (PET) 
with β-amyloid tracers is a promising tool for evaluating white matter (WM) 
damage and repair. Our aim was to investigate amyloid uptake in damaged (DWM) 
and normal-appearing WM (NAWM) of MS patients, and to evaluate possible 
correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid1-42 (Aβ) levels, 
amyloid tracer uptake, and brain volumes.
METHODS: Twelve MS patients were recruited and divided according to their 
disease activity into active and non-active groups. All participants underwent 
neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, lumbar puncture, brain 
magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging, and 18F-florbetapir PET. Aβ levels were 
determined in CSF samples from all patients. MRI and PET images were 
co-registered, and mean standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated for 
each patient in the NAWM and in the DWM. To calculate brain volumes, brain 
segmentation was performed using statistical parametric mapping software. 
Nonparametric statistical analyses for between-group comparisons and regression 
analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: We found a lower SUV in DWM compared to NAWM (p < 0.001) in all 
patients. Decreased NAWM-SUV was observed in the active compared to non-active 
group (p < 0.05). Considering only active patients, NAWM volume correlated with 
NAWM-SUV (p = 0.01). Interestingly, CSF Aβ concentration was a predictor of both 
NAWM-SUV (r = 0.79; p = 0.01) and NAWM volume (r = 0.81, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and NAWM-SUV suggests that 
the predictive role of β-amyloid may be linked to early myelin damage and may 
reflect disease activity and clinical progression.

Interleukin-7 receptor α-chain (IL7RA) haplotypes are associated with 
susceptibility to autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Previous 
studies found lower soluble IL-7Rα (sIL-7Rα) serum levels of the 
protection-associated IL7RA haplotype assumed to reduce IL-7 availability for 
self-reactive T cells. Also, a risk-associated IL7RA haplotype is accompanied by 
lower sIL-7Rα serum concentrations but no underlying mechanisms have been 
described and the causative polymorphism remains unknown. Here, we characterized 
functional implications of the nonsynonymous rs1494558 (Thr66Ile), which tags 
the protection-associated IL7RA haplotype, in HEK293T cells and serum samples of 
T1D patients with different haplotype carriers. Influence of risk- and 
protection-associated haplotypes on IL-7Rα was analyzed. The risk-associated 
Ile66 variant affected gel mobility and impaired secretion of the sIL-7Rα as 
well as expression of the membrane-associated (m)IL-7Rα in HEK293T cells. Serum 
sIL-7Rα analyses confirmed differential gel mobility of the Ile66 variant and 
found decreased sIL-7Rα serum levels of T1D patients carrying the Ile66-tagged 
haplotype. Differences in glycosylation were not causative for differential 
mobility but enhanced the effects on impaired secretion. Comparison of 
protection- and risk-associated haplotypes in a cell line-based in vitro model 
identified dominant effects of the protective haplotype tagged by rs6897932 
(Ile244) on mIL-7Rα expression, whereas the risk haplotype mainly affected the 
sIL-7Rα. This study identified novel functional effects of the Ile66 IL7RA 
variant and characterized features of autoimmunity risk- and 
protection-associated haplotypes. The findings add to our understanding of how 
these haplotypes regulate sIL-7Rα and mIL-7Rα expression in T cells causing 
differential susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.

Increasing evidence suggests a role for the immune system to finely tune 
metabolic homeostasis. The possibility that the immune system can likewise 
regulate islet endocrine function has only commenced drawing attention. Islet 
beta cells are the main producers of insulin and have to dynamically respond to 
fluctuating insulin demands of the body. While inflammation has long been 
considered as an important pathogenic feature of diabetes development, pioneer 
studies have shown that immune cells reside inside pancreatic islets under 
steady state and that components of the immune system can promote beta cell 
insulin production. The present review will thus highlight the recent research 
on specific immune pathways regulating beta cell function discussing the 
beneficial influence of innate immune cells.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the remission rate of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in real-world studies and to summarize 
potential predictors of remission in RA. Studies reporting remission rate in 
patients with RA were searched from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases. Two 
reviewers independently assessed all studies according to eligibility criteria 
and extracted data. Generally, observational studies reporting remission rate in 
adult (≥ 18 years) patients with RA were included. Quality assessments were 
performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled analyses of remission rate 
were conducted using a random-effects model and data were analyzed in subgroups 
to identify potential source of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed by serially excluding each study. Potential predictors of remission 
were summarized. Thirty-one studies with ~ 82,450 RA patients in total were 
included. Using the DAS28 remission criteria, the pooled 3-, 6-, 12-, and 
24-month remission rates were 17.2%, 16.3%, 21.5%, and 23.5%, respectively. 
Subgroup analyses showed that 11.7% and 13.8% of TNFi inadequate responders 
reached remission after 6- and 12-month use of non-TNFi biologics. Predictors of 
remission included male, higher education level, and lower baseline disease 
activity, while initial use of corticosteroids was negative predictors of 
remission. Sustained remission was rare regardless of different criteria used. 
Remission was a reachable target in real-world studies, while attention should 
also be paid to achieve sustained remission.

This review presents some examples of studies using the European rabbit 
(Oryctolagus cuniculus) that have led to, and continue to, contribute to 
advancement of understanding of human diseases as well as therapeutics 
development. In addition, we tabulate FDA-approved rabbit polyclonal and rabbit 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are used for diagnostic applications, as well 
as an overview of some "humanized" or otherwise altered rabbit mAbs that are in 
initial phase I, II, or advanced to phase III clinical trials. Information about 
endogenous retriviruses learned from studies of rabbits and other members of the 
order Lagomorpha are summarized as this knowledge now applies to new 
therapeutics being developed for several human diseases including Multiple 
Sclerosis, Type 1 Diabetes and Cancer.

Insulin replacement therapy is a fundamental treatment for glycemic control for 
managing diabetes. The engineering of insulin analogues has focused on providing 
formulations with action profiles that mimic as closely as possible the pattern 
of physiological insulin secretion that normally occurs in healthy individuals 
without diabetes. Hence, it may be helpful to practitioners to visualize insulin 
concentration profiles and associated glucose action profiles. Expanding on a 
previous analysis that established a pharmacokinetic (PK) model to describe 
typical profiles of insulin concentration over time following subcutaneous 
administration of various insulin formulations, the goal of the current analysis 
was to link the PK model to an integrated glucose-insulin (IGI) systems 
pharmacology model. After the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model was 
qualified by comparing model predictions with clinical observations, it was used 
to project insulin (PK) and glucose (PD) profiles of common insulin regimens and 
dosing scenarios. The application of the PK-PD model to clinical scenarios was 
further explored by incorporating the impact of several hypothetical factors 
together, such as changing the timing or frequency of administration in a 
multiple-dosing regimen over the course of a day, administration of more than 1 
insulin formulation, or insulin dosing adjusted for carbohydrates in meals. 
Visualizations of insulin and glucose profiles for commonly prescribed regimens 
could be rapidly generated by implementing the linked subcutaneous insulin 
PK-IGI model using the R statistical program (version 3.4.4) and a contemporary 
web-based interface, which could enhance clinical education on glycemic control 
with insulin therapy.

AIMS: Epidemiological data on subclinical atherosclerotic disease in type 1 
diabetes mellitus (DM1) are scarce. We aimed to estimate the subclinical 
atherosclerosis profile of asymptomatic patients with DM1 and an abnormal 
ankle-brachial index (ABI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional design (ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier: NCT02910271), we estimated ABI in 289 consecutive asymptomatic 
patients with DM1. An abnormal ABI led to measurements of toe-brachial index 
(TBI) and peripheral doppler ultrasound (DUS) to diagnose peripheral artery 
disease (PAD) and/or atherosclerotic carotid plaques (ACP).
RESULTS: A reduced (≤0.9) or increased (>1.2) ABI was detected in 17 (6%) and 75 
(26%) patients, respectively. PAD was confirmed by TBI and DUS in 9 (53%) 
patients with a reduced ABI and 28 (37%) patients with an increased ABI, 
resulting in a 12.8% (9.4-17.2) prevalence of asymptomatic PAD. Fourteen 
patients with an abnormal ABI also exhibited ACP [4.8% (2.9-7.9)], with 64% of 
these patients showing bilateral disease. Artery stenosis was mild or moderate 
in 21% and 29% of patients, respectively. Thus, 46 [16% (12-21)] patients showed 
asymptomatic PAD, ACP, or both. According to our data, we would have to explore 
three asymptomatic patients with DM1 and normal pulses to unmask one case of 
PAD, and seven asymptomatic patients showing abnormal ABI values to detect one 
carotid disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral artery disease is often undiagnosed in asymptomatic 
patients with DM1. However, its presence may change medical management in a 
substantial percentage of cases, highlighting the potential benefit of a 
thorough vascular assessment on these patients.

AIM: To study the influence of total glucosides of paeony (TGP) on the 
expression of peripheral blood programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its 
ligand (PD-L1) in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS).
METHOD: Ten patients with new-onset pSS were selected as the experimental group 
and were treated with 1.8 g of TGP (the main ingredient is Radix Paeoniae Alba) 
daily for 3 months; furthermore, 10 physically healthy individuals were selected 
as the control group. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and flow 
cytometry was used to detect PD-1 expression on the surface of CD4+ T and CD8+ T 
lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression on the surface of CD14+ monocytes and CD19+ B 
cells before and after treatment in the experimental and control groups. 
Furthermore, plasma levels of soluble PD-1 (sPD-1), interleukin (IL)-10, and 
IL-17A were also determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The PD-1 expression on the surface of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 
the peripheral blood of patients with pSS were significantly higher than in the 
control group (P < 0.001). However, PD-L1 expression on the surface of CD14+ 
monocytes declined but not significantly (P > 0.05), and PD-L1 expression on the 
surface of CD19+ B cells increased significantly (P < 0.001). Moreover, sPD-1 
and IL-17A levels in the plasma of the experimental group were significantly 
higher than in the control group (P < 0.001), but the IL-10 level was 
significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.001). After TGP treatment, 
PD-1 expression on the surface of CD4+ T and CD8+ lymphocytes in the peripheral 
blood of patients with pSS had decreased significantly (P < 0.001); the PD-L1 
expression on the surface of CD19+ cells had decreased significantly (P < 
0.001); and the PD-L1 expression on the surface of CD14+ monocytes did not 
differ significantly (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the levels of sPD-1 and IL-17A in 
plasma had decreased (P < 0.01) and IL-10 levels had increased after TGP 
treatment (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: PD-1/PD-L1 molecules expressed on the surface of T cells, B cells, 
and monokaryon participated in the pathogenesis and development of SS through 
interactions. Therefore, TGP, which may increase the expression of PD-1 and its 
relevant ligand PD-L1 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, may play a role 
in the pathogenesis and development of SS through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by 
regulating regulatory T cells/T helper cell 17.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Evidence of the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in the 
pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has remained inconclusive. Our aim was to 
elucidate the possible role of CMV infection in the initiation of islet 
autoimmunity and in the progression to clinical T1D among children with human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-conferred T1D risk.
METHODS: A total of 1402 children from the prospective Type 1 Diabetes 
Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) study were analyzed for CMV-specific IgG 
antibodies during early childhood. All the children carried HLA-DQ genotypes 
associated with increased risk for T1D. The effect of CMV infection on the 
appearance of T1D-associated autoantibodies (insulin autoantibodies [IAA], 
glutamic acid decarboxylase [GADA], and insulinoma antigen-2 [IA-2A], n = 356) 
and on the progression rate to clinical T1D (n = 233) were analyzed with 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Log-rank test.
RESULTS: Early childhood CMV infection was inversely associated with the 
development of T1D during childhood. Cumulative progression to T1D was decreased 
in subjects with an early CMV infection (P = 0.035). In further analyses, the 
effect of early CMV infection on the initiation of islet autoimmunity and 
progression to clinical T1D were examined separately. Interestingly, early CMV 
infection did not affect the appearance of T1D-associated autoantibodies but a 
decelerating effect was observed on the progression rate from islet autoimmunity 
to clinical T1D (P = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that an early childhood CMV infection may 
decelerate the progression from islet autoimmunity to clinical T1D among at-risk 
children and may thus protect these children from progressing to T1D during 
childhood.

fully validated in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 
the clinical setting. This study evaluated the short-term effectiveness and 
continuation rate of HCQ therapy in Japanese patients with SLE in the clinical 
setting for 12 months.
METHODS: The primary endpoint was defined as the continuation rate up to 12 
months after the introduction of HCQ in 122 patients with SLE. The secondary 
endpoints included changes in the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and the 
British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index, and the effect on 
concomitant corticosteroid (CS) dose reduction.
RESULTS: The primary endpoint, continuation rate up to 12 months after the 
introduction of HCQ, was 79.5%. Of 25 patients who discontinued HCQ, 23 patients 
terminated the therapy within 2 months. The secondary endpoints (SLEDAI, BILAG 
index, and concomitant CS dose [mg/day, prednisolone equivalent]) all showed a 
significant decrease. SLEDAI and BILAG index scores indicated significant 
improvement during the remission induction phase, maintenance phase, and HCQ 
monotherapy phase.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that, with attention paid to 
possible adverse events immediately after initiation, HCQ may be initiated as a 
mainstay of SLE therapy in Japanese patients, either as a concomitant medication 
in the remission induction phase, as a maintenance therapy, or as a monotherapy.

Movement disorders are one of the common clinical features of neurological 
disease associated with neuronal antibodies which is a group of potentially 
reversible disorder. They can present with hypokinetic or hyperkinetic types of 
involuntary movements and may have other associated neurological symptoms. The 
spectrum of abnormal movements associated with neuronal antibodies is widening. 
Some specific phenomenology of movement disorders are likely to give clue about 
the type of antibody, for instance, presence of paroxysmal dystonia 
(facio-brachial dystonic seizures) are a pointer toward presence of LGI-1 
antibodies, and orofacial lingual dyskinesia is associated with NMDAR associated 
encephalitis. The presence of specific type of movement disorder allows high 
suspicion of testing of certain specific type of antibodies. In this review, we 
have discussed the various antibodies and the spectrum of movement disorder 
associated with them, highlighting if any distinct movement disorder allows the 
clinician to suspect type of antibody in a certain clinical context. We have 
also reviewed the treatment of the movement disorder associated with the 
neuronal antibodies. Physicians should have high index of suspicion of these 
disorders, as early institution of treatment options can lead to better outcome.

There is little consensus regarding the association between pemphigus and 
psoriasis. The aim of the current study is to synthesize existing data on the 
prevalence of psoriasis in patients with pemphigus and on the association 
between the two conditions. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis 
of observational studies in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science (1900-2018). 
Reference lists of included studies were also searched for eligible studies. 
Quality of evidence was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). A 
meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models to estimate pooled 
prevalence rates and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Twelve eligible studies 
comprising 12,238 patients with pemphigus were included in the quantitative 
synthesis. The overall random-effects pooled prevalence of psoriasis among 
patients with pemphigus was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.0-4.4) across all studies. The 
overall pooled multivariate OR for psoriasis in patients with pemphigus was 
significantly increased and estimated at 3.5 (95% CI, 1.6-7.6). In conclusion, a 
significant association was found between pemphigus and psoriasis. Physicians 
managing patients with pemphigus may be aware of this comorbidity. Further 
studies are warranted to establish the precise mechanisms underlying this 
relationship.

PURPOSE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with 
methotrexate, compared with methotrexate alone, for the management of uveitis 
associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis based on a clinical trial and decision analytic 
model.
PARTICIPANTS: Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age with persistently 
active uveitis associated with JIA, despite optimized methotrexate treatment for 
at least 12 weeks.
METHODS: The SYCAMORE (Randomised controlled trial of the clinical 
effectiveness, SafetY and Cost effectiveness of Adalimumab in combination with 
MethOtRExate for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated 
uveitis) trial (identifier, ISRCTN10065623) of methotrexate (up to 25 mg weekly) 
with or without fortnightly administered adalimumab (20 or 40 mg, according to 
body weight) provided data on resource use (based on patient self-report and 
electronic records) and health utilities (from the Health Utilities Index 
questionnaire). Surgical event rates and long-term outcomes were based on data 
from a 10-year longitudinal cohort. A Markov model was used to extrapolate the 
effects of treatment based on visual impairment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical costs to the National Health Service in the 
United Kingdom, utility of defined health states, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY.
RESULTS: Adalimumab in combination with methotrexate resulted in additional 
costs of £39 316, with a 0.30 QALY gain compared with methotrexate alone, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £129 025 per QALY 
gained. The probability of cost effectiveness at a threshold of £30 000 per QALY 
was less than 1%. Based on a threshold analysis, a price reduction of 84% would 
be necessary for adalimumab to be cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is clinically effective in uveitis associated with JIA; 
however, its cost effectiveness is not demonstrated compared with methotrexate 
alone in the United Kingdom setting.

Environmental Health, Japan , Kitakyushu , Fukuoka , Japan.

As stated in the comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related disease 
(IgG4-RD), IgG4-RD is characterized by elevated serum IgG4 level and 
pathological findings, characterized by infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma 
cells. In addition to fibrotic changes, dysregulated activation of lymphocytes 
is considered as one of major pathogenic events in IgG4-RD. Among lymphocytes, 
the importance of plasmablast, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, T type 2 helper 
(Th2) cells, T regulatory (Treg) cells, and CD4 positive T cells with cytotoxic 
activity has been reported. Conversely, comprehensive immunophenotyping in 
patients with IgG4-RD revealed that there are two different axes consisting 
plasmablast-Tfh cells and Treg cells. There is need for research to seek out 
molecules associated with these immunocompetent cell interactions. It is 
believed that this will contribute to the future application to disease-specific 
treatment for IgG4-RD.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a newly defined multi-organ disease proposed 
by Japanese physicians. IgG4-RD is characterized by elevated serum levels of 
IgG4 and massive infiltration of IgG4-expressing plasma cells in the affected 
organs. Recent studies have shown that abnormal adaptive immune responses 
mediated by T helper type 2 cells, regulatory T cells, follicular helper T 
cells, cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, and plasmablasts are involved in IgG4-RD 
immunopathogenesis. In addition to adaptive immune responses, innate immune 
responses play pathogenic roles in IgG4-RD. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), 
M2 macrophages, and basophils are activated to produce various kinds of 
cytokines in IgG4-RD. Recent studies highlight the importance of type I IFN and 
IL-33 produced by pDCs in IgG4-RD immunopathogenesis.

PURPOSE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex, chronic disease that can have 
debilitating effects on daily activities and well-being, compromising 
health-related quality of life. One underlying determinant of quality of life 
(QOL) is perceived illness intrusiveness, which examines the disruptiveness of 
the condition and/or its related treatment on engagement in interest and 
activities, in turn affecting psychological functioning. There is evidence that 
persons with MS (PwMS) have higher level of illness intrusiveness compared to 
those with other chronic conditions; however, limited research exists on 
differences by sex. This study aimed to explore these possible differences 
between men and women, hypothesizing that men with MS will have overall higher 
illness intrusiveness (lower QOL) when compared to women with MS.
METHODS: A total of 922 PwMS were primarily recruited through the North American 
Research Committee on MS Registry. The participants completed a one-time 
anonymous online survey. Illness intrusiveness was measured using the Illness 
Intrusiveness Ratings Scale (IIRS) total score and three subscales. Independent 
t-tests determined differences in demographics, disease characteristics, and 
IIRS outcomes. Hierarchical regressions were then used to further assess whether 
sex was a significant predictor of illness intrusiveness.
RESULTS: Men exhibited greater overall, intimacy, and relationship and personal 
development-related perceived illness intrusiveness. However, sex was only a 
significant predictor of the Intimacy IIRS subscale after accounting for age, 
disability, and depression.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the intrusiveness of MS on intimacy and 
sexual functioning, particularly among men. Potential clinical implications and 
future directions are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive value of some clinical and biochemical 
parameters, and of the +49 A/G polymorphism of the CTLA-4 gene, for long-term 
remission following the withdrawal of antithyroid drugs before starting 
antithyroid drug therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational, prospective and longitudinal study.
METHODS: Seventy-two patients (11 of whom were men) with newly diagnosed Graves' 
hyperthyroidism who had been attended consecutively at a University Clinic in a 
population with sufficient iodine intake were included in the study.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: patients under the age of 18, pregnant women and 
non-Caucasian patients. All subjects were treated following a well-defined 
protocol. Long-term remission was calculated at 12 and 36 months following 
withdrawal of the antithyroid drug.
RESULTS: Thirty-six of the 72 study subjects experienced a remission of at least 
12 months following withdrawal of methimazole, with no differences according to 
their age or sex. A comparison made between the remission rates seen in both 
groups yielded significant differences regarding the presence of Graves' 
orbitopathy, the duration of the treatment with methimazole and the absence of 
the CTLA-4 G/G genotype. In the univariate and multivariate analyses performed, 
only lower frequencies of Graves' orbitopathy and an absence of the CTLA-4 G/G 
genotype were considered independent predictors of long-term remission.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of Graves' orbitopathy and of the CTLA-4 G/G genotype 
are independent predictors of long-term remission following a first course of 
antithyroid drugs.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, 
and inflammation is highly associated with atherosclerosis and increased 
cardiovascular risk. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and arterial 
stiffness measurements are commonly used to detect subclinical atherosclerosis. 
The aim of this study was to non-invasively demonstrate the presence of 
subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with pSS through these measurements, 
using ultrasound (US) radiofrequency (RF) data technology. 30 pSS patients as 
the study group and 30 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers as the control 
group were included in this study. The age of the participants in the entire 
sample ranged from 18 to 60 years, and no primary cardiovascular risk factors 
were present, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or 
obesity. The participants in the study and control groups were evaluated with 
doppler ultrasonography. Arterial stiffness and CIMT measurements were made from 
the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) using US RF data technology. No 
statistically significant difference was identified between the patients with 
pSS and the controls in terms of the right, left, and mean CCA IMT; the right 
side distensibility coefficient (DC) and compliance coefficient (CC); or the 
right- and left-side α and β stiffness indices values (p > 0.05). Compared to 
the control subjects, the pSS patients had higher right and left side pulsed 
wave velocity (PWV), the mean value of the right and the left sides α stiffness 
index, β stiffness index, and PWV (p < 0.05). The pSS patients' left DC, left 
CC, and the mean value of the right and left sides DC and CC were lower than 
controls (p < 0,05). It was found that patients with pSS show evidence of 
subclinical atherosclerosis. To determine this situation in patients with pSS, 
CIMT and PWV measurements may serve as a guide. Radiofrequency data technology 
represents a non-invasive approach to the accurate and quantitative measurement 
of CIMT elevation and decreases in vascular elasticity.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be associated with various types of 
malignancy. However, SLE occurring with ovarian cancer seems rare, and reliable 
therapeutic approaches for such cases have yet to be identified. We herein 
report a case of SLE with ovarian cancer that was successfully treated with 
corticosteroid, plasmapheresis and chemotherapy. This case may provide new 
insights into treatment approaches for SLE with ovarian cancer.

Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies are frequently 
detected in amyopathic dermatomyositis with rapidly progressive interstitial 
lung disease (RP-ILD). However, the presence of anti-MDA5 antibodies in other 
connective tissue diseases is not well known. We herein report a case of 
rheumatoid arthritis complicated with refractory anti-MDA5 antibody-positive 
ILD. A 75-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital for refractory 
ILD. Serological testing was positive for anti-MDA5 antibody without any muscle 
or skin lesions. Immunosuppressive therapy (prednisolone and tacrolimus) 
ameliorated her symptoms as well as ILD. Anti-MDA5 antibody-positive ILD, as 
well as dermatomyositis with RP-ILD, can occur in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis.

Both autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) are known to be 
complicated by other autoimmune diseases. However, AIH complicated by EF has 
never been reported. We experienced a 58-year-old man with AIH complicated by 
EF. He was admitted to our hospital with acute hepatic injury and edema of the 
legs in April 201X. The etiologies of these symptoms were histologically proven 
as AIH and EF. The administration of prednisolone (PSL) drastically improved his 
liver injury and edema of the legs. When we make a diagnosis of AIH, we should 
carefully evaluate the physical findings, including the appearance of the legs, 
in order to detect other coexisting autoimmune diseases.

In 1982, we reported a case of retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) exhibiting various 
clinical manifestations. Our current understanding of immunoglobulin G4 
(IgG4)-related disease led us to consider it as a possible diagnosis because all 
of the patient's clinical features could be explained by this disease entity. To 
confirm our hypothesis, were investigated the histopathological findings of 
resected specimens that had been stored for 35 years postoperatively. Typical 
pathological findings together with predominant IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration 
confirmed a potential diagnosis of IgG4-related RPF. Furthermore, we observed 
positive immunohistochemical staining for several molecules associated with T 
regulatory and T follicular helper cells.

The effects of bariatric/metabolic surgery on glycemic control in obese type 1 
diabetic patients are controversial. We herein report a case of a morbidly obese 
35-year-old woman who completely recovered from slowly progressive type 1 
diabetes (SPIDDM) following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Preoperatively, her 
body mass index (BMI) was 49.8 kg/m2 and hemoglobin A1c was 5.7% with intensive 
insulin therapy. Six months after bariatric/metabolic surgery, her BMI decreased 
to 33.2 kg/m2 and her glycemic control was normal despite the discontinuation of 
all diabetic medicine. This case demonstrates the usefulness of 
bariatric/metabolic surgery for achieving glycemic control in morbidly obese 
patients with SPIDDM in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common form of autoimmune 
thyroid disorders characterized by lower production of thyroid hormones and 
positivity to autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) and/or thyroid peroxidase 
(TPOAb). We performed a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of patients 
with HT, with specific focus on thyroid autoimmunity, to get better 
understanding of disease manifestation.
METHODS: We collected information on thyroid-specific phenotypes (TSH, T3, T4, 
fT4, TgAb, TPOAb, thyroid volume) and other clinical phenotypes (age, body 
surface area, number of hypothyroidism symptoms, blood pressure) from 290 
patients with HT without levothyroxine (LT4) therapy with the aim to test for 
correlations between thyroid-specific and clinical phenotypes.
RESULTS: Our key and novel finding is the existence of significant positive 
correlation between TgAb levels and the number of symptoms (r = 0.25, 
p = 0.0001) in HT patients without LT4 therapy that remained significant after 
adjustment for TPOAb, T3, TSH levels and thyroid volume (β = 0.66, SE = 0.3, 
p = 0.0299). Increased TgAb levels are significantly associated with fragile 
hair (p = 0.0043), face edema (p = 0.0061), edema of the eyes (p = 0.0293) and 
harsh voice (p = 0.0349).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TgAb levels are associated with symptom burden in HT 
patients, suggesting a role of thyroid autoimmunity in clinical manifestations 
of HT. Based on these results, we recommend screening for TgAb antibodies in HT 
patients with symptom burden. We also suggest that further work on 
understandings of symptoms appearance due to their autoimmune or hypothyroid 
causation is needed.

As part of the single technology appraisal process, the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence invited Merck to submit evidence for the clinical and 
cost effectiveness of cladribine tablets (cladribine) for the treatment of 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Rapidly evolving severe (RES) and 
sub-optimally treated (SOT) RRMS were specified by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence as subgroups of interest. The Liverpool Reviews and 
Implementation Group at the University of Liverpool was the Evidence Review 
Group. This article summarises the Evidence Review Group's review of the 
company's evidence submission for cladribine and the Appraisal Committee's final 
decision. The final scope issued by the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence listed the following disease-modifying treatments as comparators: 
alemtuzumab, daclizumab, fingolimod and natalizumab. At the time of the company 
submission, a licence was anticipated for low-dose cladribine. The main clinical 
evidence (the CLARITY trial) in the company submission focused on the efficacy 
of low-dose cladribine vs. placebo. The CLARITY trial showed a statistically 
significant reduction in relapse rate for cladribine in the RES-RRMS subgroup 
(n = 50) but not in the SOT-RRMS subgroup (n = 19). Cladribine showed a 
numerical, but not a statistically significant, advantage in delaying disability 
progression at 6 months in the RES-RRMS subgroup. Disability progression 
benefits could not be estimated for those in the SOT-RRMS subgroup because of 
few events. The Evidence Review Group's main concern regarding the clinical 
evidence was the small sample size of the subgroups. To compare the 
effectiveness of cladribine to other disease-modifying treatments, the company 
conducted network meta-analyses, which showed cladribine and its comparators to 
be equally effective. The Evidence Review Group considered the results of the 
disease-modifying treatments to be unreliable because few trials were in the 
network. The company's cost-effectiveness evidence showed cladribine to be 
cheaper and more effective than other disease-modifying treatments in the 
RES-RRMS arm and the SOT-RRMS arm. The results were most sensitive to treatment 
effect on disability progression at 6 months. The Evidence Review Group was 
concerned that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that cladribine was 
superior to placebo in delaying disability progression. The Evidence Review 
Group amended the company's economic model to allow alternative estimates for 
the treatment effect of cladribine and its comparators on relapse rate and 
disability progression at 6 months. The Evidence Review Group made other changes 
to the company model. After implementing all the amendments, cladribine remained 
cost effective in the RES-RRMS and SOT-RRMS subgroups. The Appraisal Committee 
recognised the uncertainty in the available data but concluded that cladribine 
could be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources.

The study aims to analyze the association between the bone and 
cartilage/periarticular components of the radiographic joint damage and 
disability over the course of disease, in a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
patients from a day-to-day clinical practice. The secondary aim is to study the 
role of demographic and disease-related variables in this association. We 
performed a retrospective longitudinal study including 736 RA patients. 
Disability was assessed with the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), and 
radiographic joint damage of hands and wrists with the Sharp van-der-Heijde 
score (total (SHS), erosion (ES), and narrowing/(sub)luxation (NSLS) 
components]. Generalized estimating equations models, adjusted by disease 
activity, demographic and disease-related variables, were used to test the 
relationship between SHS and medium-term (median value of the HAQs performed in 
the following year after each radiograph) and long-term (set of HAQ measures 
performed during follow-up, at least 1 year apart from the first x-ray) 
disability. Interaction terms between the SHS and demographic and 
disease-related variables were introduced in the models. To account for multiple 
testing, Bonferroni correction was applied. NSLS was independently associated 
with medium-term disability, even after Bonferroni correction. We observed 
significant and positive interactions between NSLS and age at x-ray, and with 
the ES. SHS showed no association with long-term disability. The cartilage/soft 
tissue component of the radiographic joint damage seems to exert a much more 
important role in medium-term disability than the erosive component. This 
association could be modulated by the age at the x-ray and by the magnitude of 
the erosive damage.

BACKGROUND: The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with 
streptococcal infection (PANDAS) hypothesis suggests an association between 
group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections and subsequent onset or 
exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder 
or tic disorders.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including 
longitudinal, prospective studies on exacerbations of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
associated with GABHS infections in children with PANDAS. We searched PubMed and 
EMBASE through August 14, 2017. Two independent reviewers extracted data and we 
used random-effects analysis to calculate rate ratios (RR).
RESULTS: Three studies were included with a total of 82 PANDAS cases and 127 
control children with obsessive-compulsive disorder or chronic tic disorder. 
PANDAS cases had a nonsignificantly increased RR of 2.33 [95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.63-8.70, P = 0.21, I = 28.3%] for exacerbations of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in temporal proximity to a GABHS infection and no 
increased risk of GABHS infections (RR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.56-1.73, P = 0.97, I = 
45%) compared with the control children. However, PANDAS cases had an increased 
risk of neuropsychiatric exacerbations in general with a RR of 1.54 (95% CI: 
1.12-2.11, P = 0.008, I = 0%) compared with the control children. The studies 
had methodologic heterogeneity, high risk of selection bias and differed 
concerning case definition and infection measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not show significant evidence concerning higher 
rates of temporally associated GABHS infections and exacerbations of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with PANDAS. The included studies were 
small and limited by low GABHS rates and exacerbations. Future studies with 
large population sizes and routine evaluations are needed to thoroughly examine 
the PANDAS hypothesis.

It has been suggested that technetium-99m (99mTc)-anti-tumour necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-α) scintigraphy (SCI) may be a useful diagnostic tool in Graves' 
ophthalmopathy (GO). This study evaluated whether orbit total radioactivity 
uptake on SCI could be used to predict corticosteroid therapy (CorT) responses 
in active-GO patients. A longitudinal study of patients with active GO defined 
by Clinical Active Score (CAS) >3/7 was done. Clinical, laboratory and SCI 
evaluations were performed at baseline and 3 months after concluding intravenous 
CorT. SCI (planar and tomographic) was assessed after intravenous injection of 
10 mCi of 99mTc-anti-TNF-α. Orbits and cerebral hemispheres were defined as 
regions of interest (ROIs) to enable orbit/hemisphere ROI-ratios of total 
radioactive uptake. ROI-ratios were considered positive at >2·5. Average total 
radiation uptake (TRU) was also determined for each orbit (AVGROI ). Clinical, 
laboratory and SCI data were compared between responders (CAS became inactive) 
and non-responders to CorT (18 patients). At baseline, AVGROI were higher in 
active OG orbits (67·3 cps) than in inactive ones (33·6 cps; P<0·05). AVGROI 
(absolute values) reduced (-29·9 cps) in CorT responders and tended (P = 0·067) 
to differ from variations occurred in non-responders (+6·9 cps in patients with 
maintained CAS positivity post-treatment). Higher baseline ROI-ratios (4·9 
versus 3·3; P = 0·056) and its pronounced reductions following CorT (-37% versus 
+56% in non-responders; P = 0·036) tended to be associated with good CorT 
responses in the subgroup of GO history ≥1 year. SCI showed a good association 
with active eye disease and may be an additional tool to identify CorT 
responders.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the laboratory and radiological data on liver and 
investigate liver fibrosis induced by hepatic manifestation of antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) using the aspartate 
aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and an index of fibrosis (FIB-4) 
in 136 immunosuppressive drug-naïve patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 136 patients with 
AAV without chronic liver diseases or autoimmune diseases. We collected the 
laboratory and imaging results. We assessed liver fibrosis by APRI and FIB-4. 
The critical cut-offs of APRI and FIB-4 for predicting liver fibrosis are 0.5 
and 1.45. The optimal cut-off of five factor score (FFS) at diagnosis for FIB-4 
≥1.45 was extrapolated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic 
curve.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 54.6 years and 32.4% of patients were 
male (69 MPA, 38 GPA and 29 EGPA). The percentage of patients having the normal 
results of liver function tests was ranging from 86.0% to 95.6%. There were no 
patients who exhibited the significantly abnormal findings on imaging studies. 
Nonetheless, twenty-nine patients with AAV (21.3%) exhibited subclinical but 
significant liver fibrosis at diagnosis based on FIB-4. Patients with FFS ≥1 had 
a significantly higher risk of having subclinical but significant liver fibrosis 
(FIB-4 ≥1.45) than those with FFS <1 (RR 12.486).
CONCLUSIONS: AAV may increase the results of liver function tests and it may 
provoke subclinical but significant liver fibrosis at diagnosis. Furthermore, 
liver fibrosis should be considered in AAV patients having FFS ≥1.

To evaluate the association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) 
and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among a national sample cohort from Korea. Data 
were collected from 2002 through 2013 for individuals aged ≥ 20 years in the 
Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-National Sample Cohort. We 
extracted the data from RA patients (n = 7619) and 1:4-matched controls 
(n = 30,476) and analyzed the occurrence of SSNHL. Matching was performed based 
on age, sex, income, region of residence, and medical history. RA was diagnosed 
based on International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) codes (M05 or M06) 
and prescriptions for the antirheumatic drugs. SSNHL was diagnosed based on the 
relevant ICD-10 code (H912). Among the SSNHL participants, we included only 
those who had undergone an audiometry exam (claim codes: E6931-E6937, 
F6341-F6348) and received treatment with steroids. The crude and adjusted hazard 
ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox-proportional hazard models, and the 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Subgroup analyses based on age and 
sex were also performed. The rate of SSNHL in the RA group (0.8% [62/7619]) was 
higher than that in the control group (0.6% [177/30,476], P = 0.021). The crude 
and adjusted HRs for SSNHL were 1.40 (95% CI = 1.05-1.87) and 1.39 (95% 
CI = 1.04-1.86), respectively, in the RA group (each P < 0.05). The relationship 
between RA and SSNHL was observed primarily in patients aged ≥ 50 years and men. 
The risk of SSNHL is higher in patients with RA.

To assess the persistence of golimumab and other tumour necrosis factor-α 
inhibitors (TNFis) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in Slovenia. We analysed 
prospectively the collected data of all patients treated with golimumab and 
other TNFis from 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2018 from the mandatory national 
BioRx.si registry. We assessed the treatment persistence stratified by treatment 
type, indication and prior exposure to bDMARDs using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
Cox proportional regression hazards' models adjusted for the well-appreciated 
confounders. We also assessed its effectiveness at 1 year after the initiation 
of therapy. During the 7-year observation period, 24 Slovenian rheumatologists 
from eight centres contributed data on 368, and 1654 patients treated for 849, 
and 3321 person-years with golimumab and other TNFis, respectively. The overall 
proportions of RA, AS and PsA patients being persistent on golimumab vs. other 
TNFis at 2 years after starting the therapy did not differ significantly and 
were 53%, 67% and 59% vs. 47%, 65% and 59%, respectively. The crude and adjusted 
hazard ratios for golimumab discontinuation did not differ significantly between 
bDMARD-naïve and bDMARD-experienced patients for any of the indications. In 
contrast, bDMARD-experienced AS and PsA patients treated with other TNFis were 
significantly more likely to discontinue treatment. The persistence of golimumab 
in patients with RA, AS and PsA in Slovenia was comparable with its persistence 
in more affluent Western European countries. We observed a better persistence of 
golimumab compared to other TNFis in bDMARD-experienced AS and PsA patients.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-immunological demyelinating disease. From the 
immunological aspects, it is well accepted that T cells play a pivotal role in 
the etiology of the disease. T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells are thought to be 
the main pathogenic T cells in the pathogenesis of MS and are known as effector 
T cells. As the self-reactive T lymphocytes can escape clonal deletion in the 
thymus and subsequently are released into the periphery, there is an urgent need 
for peripheral tolerance, which is executed by the specialized regulatory T 
(Treg) cells. Interestingly, CD8+ regulatory T (Treg) cells have also been 
identified among lymphocyte subtypes. The peripheral CD8+ Treg cells frequency 
in MS subjects in comparison with healthy controls is the objective of the 
current study using the systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic 
literature search was carried out using specialized biomedical databases of 
Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Medline, Google Scholar, Embase and SCOPUS databases 
without the beginning date restriction until January 2018 in English language. 
The results were as follows: OR 15.548 (95% confidence interval 1.954-123.742) 
using the random-effects model. The P value for test of significance of the 
total OR was examined by the z test and calculated as 0.010 (clearly considered 
as statistically significant). Based on our findings, the number of CD8+ Treg 
cells in the blood of MS subjects is significantly different as compared to 
healthy controls.

PURPOSE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) mainly affects childbearing age 
women and pharmacological treatments may negatively influence the ovarian 
reserve. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) could be a good biomarker for ovarian 
reserve.
METHODS: AMH serum levels were assessed in 86 consecutive SLE female patients 
with regular menstrual cycle compared with 44 aged matched healthy controls. 
Clinical and demographic characteristics, disease duration, pattern of organ 
involvement, and previous and current therapies were recorded.
RESULTS: AMH levels were comparable between patients and controls 
(4.2 ± 3.1 ng/ml vs. 5.0 ± 3.1 ng/ml, p = 0.21). According to disease severity, 
AMH levels were lower in SLE patients with major organ involvement than in 
controls (3.8 ± 2.7 ng/ml vs. 5.0 ± 3.1 ng/ml, p = 0.08); no difference was 
found between SLE patients with mild organ involvement (4.5 ± 3.4 ng/ml) and 
controls (p = 0.43). Grouping patients based on the pharmacological treatments, 
AMH serum levels did not differ among SLE patients treated with antimalarials 
only (4.7 ± 3.3 ng/ml), conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(cDMARDs) only (4.8 ± 3.2 ng/ml), cDMARDs and antimalarials (3.9 ± 2.9 ng/ml) or 
cyclophosphamide (CYC) only (4.9 ± 3.9 ng/ml), compared to controls, but 
patients sequentially treated with cDMARDs and CYC, had significantly lower AMH 
serum levels than controls (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: SLE patients showed comparable AMH levels than controls, however, a 
reduction of the ovarian reserve was associated with sequentially therapy with 
CYC and cDMARDs and with the disease severity. AMH could be a sensitive and 
specific biomarker of ovarian reserve in SLE and it could be useful for 
therapeutic strategy and family planning.

University , Istanbul , Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Adipocytokines have been implied to be involved in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. MS patients whose first clinical episode is optic 
neuritis (ON) have been reported to display a milder disease course. In this 
study, we aimed to show whether this milder disease course is related to reduced 
adipokine production.
METHODS: A total of 55 (24 with ON as the first clinical episode) 
relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 40 healthy individuals were 
recruited. Concentrations of adipokines were measured in sera by ELISA.
RESULTS: The levels of adiponectin, leptin, resistin, monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-8 were significantly higher in RRMS patients compared 
with healthy controls. RRMS cases starting with ON had lower expanded disability 
status scale scores. Serum adiponectin, leptin, resistin and MCP-1 levels were 
significantly lower in MS patients, whose first clinical episode was ON.
CONCLUSIONS: MS patients with ON as the first manifestation display both lower 
disability scores and reduced serum adipokine levels implying that adipocytokine 
production is associated with MS progression. Exact mechanisms of this 
association in MS patients with first episode ON need to be further studied.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and teriflunomide are approved 
oral disease-modifying treatments for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
(MS). Phase 3 trials established these agents to be effective and generally well 
tolerated, although comparative efficacy and discontinuation rates are still 
unknown. The aim of this study was to assess real-world efficacy and 
discontinuation of DMF and teriflunomide in patients with relapsing-remitting 
MS.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study was carried out in a 
French administrative region between March 2014 and July 2017. Patients who were 
followed by private or hospital neurologists were included. Efficacy and 
tolerance of the two treatments were assessed and compared by multivariate 
analysis, considering the duration of MS, annualized relapse rate and Expanded 
Disability Status Scale score at treatment initiation, treatment duration, type 
of prescriber and tobacco use.
RESULTS: We identified 189 DMF- and 157 teriflunomide-treated patients who had 
been treated for 22 ± 10 months. After correction for confounders, DMF more 
efficiently reduced the annualized relapse rate after 2 years than teriflunomide 
(0.06 vs. 0.21; P = 0.03). DMF-treated patients had more clinical and biological 
adverse events, resulting in a higher rate of treatment discontinuation (28% vs. 
12%, P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort study, DMF demonstrated significantly 
better efficacy over 2 years than teriflunomide, but tolerance to teriflunomide 
was better.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a multi-organ chronic inflammatory process 
caused by infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in one or more organs. 
Intracranial involvement has only recently become better recognized. Our case 
series adds to the growing literature on the varying presentations of 
intracranial IgG4 by describing the clinical and imaging findings of three 
patients who presented to our institution with intracranial involvement. Our 
first patient presented with a mass-forming IgG4 pachymeningitis mimicking a 
sphenoid wing meningioma, which is to our knowledge the largest mass-forming 
pachymeningitis published in the literature. Our second case depicts another 
presentation of extensive IgG4 pachymeningitis involving both cavernous sinuses 
and surrounding Meckel's caves. The third case describes a patient with presumed 
lymphocytic hypophysitis, which was later determined to be IgG4-related 
hypophysitis with concomitant pachymeningitis and perineural spread along the 
optic nerves. The delayed diagnoses in our cases illustrates the diagnostic 
challenge that clinicians face in differentiating intracranial IgG4-RD from 
other infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis, granulomatous disease, 
tuberculosis and lymphoma. Earlier consideration of IgG4-related hypophysitis 
and hypertrophic pachymeningitis in the differential diagnosis can prevent 
significant morbidity including unnecessary surgical intervention and organ 
failure secondary to extensive fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: Recently, clinical studies have described an association between 
albumin and the derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) with several 
diseases. This study was aimed to investigate the albumin-dNLR (ALB-dNLR) score 
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and assess its relationship with clinical 
and laboratory parameters of RA.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 127 RA patients, 155 osteoarthritis (OA) 
patients, and 155 healthy controls. The ALB-dNLR score was based on serum 
albumin level, neutrophil count, and white cell count. The Spearman's rank test 
was used to measure the correlations between ALB-dNLR score and disease activity 
as well as laboratory indexes.
RESULTS: The ALB-dNLR score was significantly higher in RA patients than in OA 
patients (P < 0.001) and in healthy controls (P < 0.001). The proportion of 
higher ALB-dNLR score has been raised along with increased disease activity 
(P < 0.001). The Spearman's rank test showed that ALB-dNLR score was positively 
associated with DAS28 score, CRP, ESR, IgA, and platelet count. Moreover, the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the area under the 
curve (AUC) of ALB-dNLR was 0.693 (95% CI: 0.631-0.755), which was higher than 
that of albumin (AUC: 0.625, 95% CI: 0.559-0.692) and dNLR (AUC: 0.680, 95% CI: 
0.617-0.743) alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the ALB-dNLR score increased in RA 
patients. The ALB-dNLR score may be a useful marker to estimate the disease 
activity of RA patients.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated demyelinating disease of 
the central nervous system. Animal models of MS have been critical for 
elucidating MS pathological mechanisms and how they may be targeted for 
therapeutic intervention. Here we review the most commonly used animal models of 
MS. Although these animal models cannot fully replicate the MS disease course, a 
number of models have been developed to recapitulate certain stages. 
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been used to explore 
neuroinflammatory mechanisms and toxin-induced demyelinating models to further 
our understanding of oligodendrocyte biology, demyelination and remyelination. 
Zebrafish models of MS are emerging as a useful research tool to validate 
potential therapeutic candidates due to their rapid development and amenability 
to genetic manipulation.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease initiated by the invasion of pancreatic 
islets by immune cells that selectively kill the β cells. We found that rodent 
and human T lymphocytes release exosomes containing the microRNAs (miRNAs) 
miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, and miR-155, which can be transferred in active form to 
β cells favoring apoptosis. Inactivation of these miRNAs in recipient β cells 
prevents exosome-mediated apoptosis and protects non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice 
from diabetes development. Islets from protected NOD mice display higher insulin 
levels, lower insulitis scores, and reduced inflammation. Looking at the 
mechanisms underlying exosome action, we found that T lymphocyte exosomes 
trigger apoptosis and the expression of genes involved in chemokine signaling, 
including Ccl2, Ccl7, and Cxcl10, exclusively in β cells. The induction of these 
genes may promote the recruitment of immune cells and exacerbate β cell death 
during the autoimmune attack. Our data point to exosomal-miRNA transfer as a 
communication mode between immune and insulin-secreting cells.

Abundant evidence indicted that P2X7 receptor show a essential role in human 
health and some human diseases including hypertension, atherosclerosis, 
pulmonary inflammation, tuberculosis infection, psychiatric disorders, and 
cancer. P2X7 receptor also has an important role in some central nervous system 
diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, more research suggested 
that P2X7 receptor also plays a crucial role in bone and joint diseases. But the 
effect of P2X7 receptor on skeletal and joint diseases has not been 
systematically reviewed. In this article, the role of P2X7 receptor in skeletal 
and joint diseases is elaborated. The activation of P2X7 receptor can ameliorate 
osteoporosis by inducing a fine balance between osteoclastic resorption and 
osteoblastic bone formation. The activation of P2X7 receptor can relieve the 
stress fracture injury by increasing the response to mechanical loading and 
inducing osteogenesis. But the activation of P2X7 receptor mediates the cell 
growth and cell proliferation in bone cancer. In addition, the activation of 
P2X7 receptor can aggravate the process of some joint diseases such as 
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute gouty arthritis. The inhibition 
of P2X7 receptor can alleviate the pathological process of joint disease to some 
extent. In conclusion, P2X7 receptor may be a critical regulator and therapeutic 
target for bone and joint diseases.

OBJECTIVES: The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the disease course of 
multiple sclerosis (MS) is not established. Neurofilament light chain (NFL) is a 
sensitive marker of axonal degeneration. The aim of this study was to establish 
whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation reduces serum levels of NFL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have performed a 96 weeks placebo-controlled 
randomized study of weekly supplementation with 20 000 IU vitamin D3 in 71 
patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). Serum levels of NFL were measured 
at baseline, week 48 and week 96 with a single molecule (Simoa) assay in 69 of 
these patients.
RESULTS: Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D more than doubled in the vitamin D 
group. Compared to placebo, vitamin D supplementation had no overall effect on 
the change in serum levels of NFL from baseline (P = 0.93 at week 48 and 
P = 0.56 at week 96). In the subgroup of patients not receiving 
disease-modifying therapy, NFL decreased by 30.9% to week 48% and 32.6% to week 
96 from baseline in the vitamin D group as compared to the placebo group 
(P = 0.06 for both time points).
CONCLUSION: With a possible exception for patients not treated with 
disease-modifying drugs, weekly supplementation with 20 000 IU vitamin D3 did 
not affect NFL levels in these RRMS patients.

The 2014 French Society for Rheumatology (Société Française de Rheumatologie, 
SFR) recommendations about the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been 
updated by a task force composed of 12 expert rheumatologists, 2 patient 
self-help group representatives, and an occupational therapist. The material 
used by the task force included recent EULAR recommendations, a systematic 
literature review, and expert opinion. Four general principles and 15 
recommendations were developed. The general principles emphasize the need for 
shared decision-making between the rheumatologist and the patient and for a 
global management program including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological 
treatments. The recommendations deal with the diagnostic strategy for RA, 
treatment targets, management organization, drug selection based on the 
treatment line and prognostic factors, management of remissions, and global 
patient management. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy should 
be started as early as possible. Validated composite scores should be determined 
at regular intervals to assess disease activity - according to the tight disease 
control concept - to achieve the treatment target, i.e., a remission. 
Methotrexate is the recommended first-line DMARD. The treatment should be 
optimized when methotrexate is poorly tolerated or inadequately effective. While 
waiting for conventional synthetic DMARDs to take effect, glucocorticoid therapy 
can be used, for a brief period to keep the cumulative dose low. When a 
sustained remission without structural progression is achieved in a patient who 
is not taking glucocorticoid therapy, targeted therapy de-escalation according 
to tight disease control principles should be considered. Patients should be 
periodically screened for comorbidities and their risk factors, which should be 
evaluated and treated.

PURPOSE: To determine the incidence and prevalence of uveitis and its effect on 
multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and outcomes in patients with MS who 
participated in the fingolimod clinical trial program.
DESIGN: Analysis of pooled data (N = 27 528) from patients enrolled in 
fingolimod clinical studies and their extensions. Patients were stratified into 
4 cohorts based on the history of uveitis at baseline and uveitis events during 
the observation period: no history and no uveitis events ("no uveitis"); history 
and no uveitis events ("history"); no history and uveitis events ("first 
event"); history and uveitis events ("recurrent event").
PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients diagnosed with relapsing or primary progressive MS.
INTERVENTION: Patients received fingolimod (0.5, 1.25, or 5 mg/day), placebo, or 
intramuscular interferon beta-1a (IFNβ-1a IM) during the core studies; patients 
receiving placebo or IFNβ-1a IM were switched to fingolimod 0.5 mg therapy for 
study extensions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and prevalence of uveitis, and MS outcome 
measures, including annualized relapse rate (ARR), time to first relapse, change 
in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from baseline, and proportion 
of patients with 6-month confirmed disability progression.
RESULTS: A total of 189 patients in the analysis population had uveitis. Of 
these, 162 patients had a history of uveitis (prevalence, 0.59%). Uveitis 
occurred as a first event in 27 patients (incidence, 0.1 per 100 patient-years) 
and as a recurrent event in 10 of 162 patients (prevalence, 6.17%). Patients 
with uveitis had a significantly shorter time to first relapse (mean, 2.11 vs. 
8.12 years; P = 0.047) and a significantly higher ARR (0.31 vs. 0.21; P = 0.025) 
than those without uveitis. Mean increase in EDSS score at month 120 and the 
proportions of patients with 6-month confirmed disability progression, and with 
EDSS score ≥4 during follow-up, were similar in patients with uveitis compared 
with those without uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis involving a large patient cohort showed that 
patients with MS and uveitis had increased MS relapse activity compared with 
those without uveitis.

Neurologic patients have an increased risk for bullous pemphigoid (BP), in which 
autoantibodies target BP180, a cutaneous basement membrane protein also 
expressed in the brain. Here we show that 53.6% of sera from patients with 
multiple sclerosis (MS) (n = 56) had IgG reactivity against full-length BP180 in 
immunoblotting, while in BP180 non-collagenous 16A ELISA (n = 143), only 7.7% of 
MS samples studied were positive. Epitope mapping with 13 fusion proteins 
covering the entire BP180 polypeptide revealed that in MS and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients, IgG autoantibodies target regions located in the 
intracellular and mid-extracellular parts of BP180, but not the well-known BP 
epitopes located in the non-collagenous 16A domain and the distal 
part of extracellular domain. In indirect immunofluorescence analysis, 8.1% of 
MS sera recognized the cutaneous basement membrane and in full-length BP180 
ELISA analysis, 7.5% MS and AD sera were positive, indicating that these 
autoantibodies rarely recognize BP180 in its native conformation. Thus, in MS 
and AD patients, BP180 autoantibodies have a different epitope profile than in 
patients with BP, and seldom bind to native BP180. This explains the inability 
of these autoantibodies to cause skin symptoms. Our results suggest that the 
autoantibodies against BP180 alone are not sufficient to induce BP in MS and AD 
patients.

The vast majority of polymorphisms for human dermatologic diseases fall in 
noncoding DNA regions, leading to difficulty interpreting their functional 
significance. Recent work using chromosome conformation capture technology in 
combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has provided a systematic 
means of linking noncoding variants in active enhancer loci to putative gene 
targets. Here, we apply H3K27ac HiChIP high-resolution contact maps, generated 
from primary human T-cell subsets (CD4+ naïve, T helper type 17, and regulatory 
T cells), to 21 dermatologic conditions associated with single nucleotide 
polymorphisms from 106 genome-wide association studies. This "enhancer 
connectome" identified 1,492 HiChIP gene targets from 542 noncoding SNPs (P ≤ 
5.0 × 10-8). SNP-containing enhancers from inflammatory skin conditions were 
significantly enriched at the HLA locus and also targeted several key factors 
from the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, but nonimmune conditions were not. A 
focused profiling of systemic lupus erythematosus HiChIP genes identified 
enhancer interactions with factors important for effector CD4+ T-cell 
differentiation and function, including IRF8 and members of the Ikaros family of 
zinc-finger proteins. Our results show the ability of the enhancer connectome to 
nominate functionally relevant candidates from genome-wide association 
study-identified variants, representing a powerful tool to guide future studies 
into the genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying dermatologic diseases.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Health utilities are a preference-based method of 
valuing health states that are used in healthcare research, such as economic 
evaluations. There are limited health utility valuation data for patients with 
myasthenia gravis (MG). The aim of the study was to describe health utilities 
for patients with MG and different health states, using the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D 
utility instruments, and to explore clinical and demographic determinants of 
utilities in this population.
METHODS: Patients completed the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D. In addition, patients were 
assessed with the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America classification, 
Myasthenia Gravis Impairment Index and MG-QOL15 as disease-specific measures, 
and the Neuro-QoL Fatigue scale. We calculated mean utilities for each 
Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America severity class. We built regression 
models for the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D to determine the clinical and demographic 
factors that determine patients' valuation of their health state.
RESULTS: Among 254 patients, mean EQ-5D-5L health utilities were as follows: 
Remission, 0.94 ± 0.03; Minimal Manifestations, 0.92 ± 0.04; Class I, 
0.89 ± 0.06; Class II, 0.78 ± 0.16; Class III, 0.58 ± 0.24 and Class IV, 
0.61 ± 0.22. Mean SF-6D health utilities were as follows: Remission, 
0.83 ± 0.07; Minimal Manifestations, 0.86 ± 0.14; Class I, 0.82 ± 0.14; Class 
II, 0.67 ± 0.12; Class III, 0.56 ± 0.11 and Class IV, 0.50 ± 0.10. The 
limb/axial scores were more highly correlated to health utilities than ocular or 
bulbar scores.
CONCLUSIONS: We present estimates of health utilities for patients with MG that 
can be used in cost-utility and decision analyses. Limb/axial symptoms had a 
higher impact on health utilities than ocular or bulbar symptoms, which might 
reflect the impact of mobility on health valuation.

Neurovascular coupling reflects the close relationship between neuronal activity 
and cerebral blood flow (CBF), providing a new mechanistic insight into health 
and disease. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune inflammatory 
demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and shows cognitive 
decline-related brain gray matter abnormalities besides the damage of optic 
nerve and spinal cord. We aimed to investigate neurovascular coupling alteration 
and its clinical significance in NMO by using regional homogeneity (ReHo) to 
measure neuronal activity and CBF to measure vascular response. ReHo was 
calculated from functional MRI and CBF was computed from arterial spin labeling 
(ASL) in 56 patients with NMO and 63 healthy controls. Global neurovascular 
coupling was assessed by across-voxel CBF-ReHo correlations and regional 
neurovascular coupling was evaluated by CBF/ReHo ratio. Correlations between 
CBF/ReHo ratio and clinical variables were explored in patients with NMO. Global 
CBF-ReHo coupling was decreased in patients with NMO relative to healthy 
controls (p = .009). Patients with NMO showed decreased CBF/ReHo ratio 
(10.9%-17.3% reduction) in the parietal and occipital regions and increased 
CBF/ReHo ratio (8.0%-13.3% increase) in the insular, sensorimotor, temporal and 
prefrontal regions. Some of these abnormalities cannot be identified by a single 
CBF or ReHo analysis. Both abnormally decreased and increased CBF/ReHo ratios 
were correlated with more severe clinical impairments and cognitive decline in 
patients with NMO. These findings suggested that patients with NMO show abnormal 
neurovascular coupling, which is associated with disease severity and cognitive 
impairments.

BACKGROUND: GCA in the Indian Subcontinent (ISC) is rare. Our centre in London, 
UK, serves an ethnically diverse population, including a significant population 
of patients of ISC descent. We hypothesise that patients of ISC descent are no 
less likely than others to present with symptoms suggestive of GCA and therefore 
to undergo temporal artery biopsy (TAB).
METHOD: A retrospective audit of all TABs performed at our institution over an 8 
year period, to identify ethnicity (white, black, ISC, other, unknown) and 
biopsy result. We compared the proportion of all patients of ISC descent 
attending the ED to the proportion of ISC patients undergoing TAB. We compared 
the proportion of positive TABs among ISC patients with positive TABs among 
white patients. We also compared the proportion of TAB in ISC patients with all 
non-ISC ethnicities combined.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients undergoing TAB who were of ISC descent 
(16.3% of 92) was comparable to the proportion of A&E attendances made up by ISC 
patients [p = 0.1339]. 3.8% (1/26) of positive biopsies were among patients of 
ISC descent. White patients were significantly more likely to have a positive 
biopsy than patients of ISC ethnicity (33% of 61 white patients vs. 7% of 15 ISC 
[p = 0.0456]), as were patients of non-ISC ethnicity (32.5% of 77 non-ISC 
patients vs. 7% of 15 ISC patients [p = 0.0464]).
DISCUSSION: At our centre, biopsy proven GCA occurs in patients of ISC descent, 
but rarely. Full investigation for GCA continues to be appropriate where it is 
suspected, regardless of ethnicity.

Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) can aggregate amid incessant 
inflammation, as may be available in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
d-Ribose reacts more promptly than glucose monosaccharide to the proteins and 
forms heterogeneous group of products known as AGEs. Obesity includes persons 
with provocative joint inflammation with increased lipid profile. Immunogenic 
evidences recommend a cross-sectional relationship between glycated LDL-Apo B100 
and inflammation. The point of this examination was to look at the connection 
between d-ribose glycated ApoB100 (ApoB100-AGE) with obesity and rheumatoid 
arthritis. The binding specificity of auto-antibodies against ApoB100-AGE 
antigen present in obesity and rheumatoid arthritis patient's serum were 
inspected by direct binding and was further established by competitive 
inhibition ELISA. In the present study, hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, 
ketoamine moieties, hydroxyl-methyl furfural (HMF) and carbonyl substances were 
evaluated in the patients' serum via respective specific methods. The prevalence 
of auto-antibodies against ApoB100-AGE antigen was recorded to be 58% and 52.86% 
from obese and rheumatoid arthritis patient respectively in contrast to its 
native analogue (P < 0.001). Moreover, the autoantibodies present in obese and 
arthritis patients were found to be highly specific towards ApoB100-AGE as 
confirmed by inhibition ELISA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the prevalence of epilepsy in 
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) at diagnosis, the risk of developing 
epilepsy after the diagnosis of MS and the relative risk of mortality associated 
with epilepsy.
METHODS: We used the UK Clinical Practice Research Data-link to identify 2526 
patients with incident MS and 9980 age-, sex- and index year-matched non-MS 
controls from 1997 to 2006. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios 
[95% confidence interval (CI)] for epilepsy and Cox regression was used to 
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) for epilepsy and mortality.
RESULTS: Patients with incident MS were on average 45 years old and 70.9% were 
female. At diagnosis, the prevalence of epilepsy in patients with MS was 1.30% 
compared with 0.57% in non-MS controls. At diagnosis, MS was associated with an 
adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.11 (1.36-3.27) for pre-existing epilepsy. 
Among epilepsy-free patients, the cumulative probabilities of developing 
epilepsy, first recorded within 10 years of the index date, were 2.77% for 
patients with MS and 0.90% for controls. MS was associated with an adjusted HR 
(95% CI) of 6.01 (2.94-12.29) for epilepsy. Among patients with MS, epilepsy was 
associated with an HR (95% CI) of 2.23 (1.02-4.84) for all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study found an increased prevalence of 
epilepsy in patients with MS at diagnosis when compared with non-MS controls and 
the risk of developing epilepsy was also higher following the MS diagnosis. 
Patients with MS with epilepsy had a higher risk of mortality compared with 
those without.

INTRODUCTION: Muscle weakness and functional disability have not been evaluated 
in a population-based study of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).
METHODS: All patients with MG in a well-defined catchment area were identified 
in the Danish National Patient Registry. Of the 175 eligible patients, 90 
participated and were studied using MG-specific scales, isometric dynamometry, 
and functional tests. Fifty age- and sex-matched subjects served as controls.
RESULTS: Muscle strength was reduced by 13%, 21%, and 12% for shoulder 
abduction, knee extension, and ankle extension, respectively (P < 0.05). Chair 
stand and 400-meter walking were impaired by 24% and 23%, respectively 
(P < 0.05). Muscle strength and functional performances were related to 
MG-specific scales.
DISCUSSION: MG patients have moderately reduced isometric muscle strength and 
impaired physical performance. Muscle weakness and functional tests relate 
closely to MG-specific scales, suggesting that dynamometry and functional tests 
can be used to monitor MG patients and as efficacy parameters in clinical 
trials. Muscle Nerve 59:218-223, 2019.

Families of children with diabetes increasingly obtain health information from a 
variety of sources. Doctor-patient relationships have accordingly become more 
fluid and dynamic with input from other parties. These outside parties include 
representatives from the diabetes health care industry-industry third parties 
(ITPs). This review is an exploration of the ethical principles and cognitive 
processes involved when doctors and patients negotiate around health care 
practices and the role of ITPs in that dialogue. Ethical principles of conflicts 
of interest, beneficence (act in the best interests of the patient), 
non-maleficence (act so as to do no harm) and justice (act so as to allocate 
resources fairly or justly) are relevant considerations. Reflexive and analytic 
thinking and various cognitive biases also play a significant part in clinical 
decision making. A complex case example is analyzed to highlight a process of 
ethical cognition in decision making to ensure high-value care and optimal 
patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of ambient temperature and 
relative humidity on insulin pharmacodynamics in adults with type 1 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-way, cross-over, randomised study was performed 
in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 10). The pharmacodynamics profile 
of a single dose of short-acting insulin (insulin lispro) was investigated, 
using a controlled environmental chamber, under three environmental conditions: 
(a) temperature: 15°C and humidity: 10%; (b) temperature: 30°C and humidity: 
10%; and (c) temperature: 30°C and humidity: 60%. A euglycaemic glucose clamp 
technique ensured constant blood glucose of 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L). The 
following pharmacodynamic endpoints were calculated: maximum glucose infusion 
rate (GIRmax ), time to GIRmax (tGIRmax ), total area under the curve (AUC) for 
GIR from 0-6 hours (AUCGIR.0-6h ), and partial AUCs (AUCGIR.0-1h , AUCGIR.0-2h 
and AUCGIR.2-6h ).
RESULTS: Higher temperature (30°C) under 10% fixed humidity conditions resulted 
in greater GIRmax (P = 0.04) and a later tGIR.max (P = 0.049) compared to lower 
temperature (15°C). Humidity did not affect any pharmacodynamic parameter. When 
the combined effects of temperature and humidity were explored, tGIR.max (P = 
0.008) occurred earlier, with a lower late insulin pharmacodynamic effect 
(AUCGIR.2-6h ; P = 0.017) at a temperature of 15°C and humidity of 10% compared 
to a temperature of 30°C and humidity of 60%.
CONCLUSIONS: High ambient temperature resulted in a greater insulin peak effect 
compared to low ambient temperature, with the contribution of high relative 
humidity apparent only at high ambient temperature. This suggests that patients 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus who are entering higher environmental 
temperatures, with or without high humidity, could experience more hypoglycaemic 
events.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to define the relationships between plasma biomarkers of 
kidney injury and intrarenal haemodynamic function (glomerular filtration rate 
[GFR], effective renal plasma flow [ERPF], renal vascular resistance [RVR]) in 
adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
METHODS: The study sample comprised patients with longstanding T1D (duration ≥50 
years), among whom 44 were diabetic kidney disease (DKD) resistors (eGFR >60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 and <30 mg/d urine albumin excretion) and 22 had DKD, in addition 
to 73 control participants. GFRINULIN and ERPFPAH were measured, RVR was 
calculated, and afferent (RA )/efferent (RE ) areteriolar resistances were 
derived from Gomez equations. Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 
(NGAL), β2 microglobulin (B2M), osteopontin (OPN) and uromodulin (UMOD) were 
measured using immunoassay kits from Meso Scale Discovery.
RESULTS: Plasma NGAL, B2M and OPN were higher and UMOD was lower in DKD patients 
vs DKD resistors and non-diabetic controls. In participants with T1D, plasma 
NGAL inversely correlated with GFR (r = -0.33; P = 0.006) and ERPF (r = -0.34; P 
= 0.006), and correlated positively with RA (r = 0.26; P = 0.03) and RVR (r = 
0.31; P = 0.01). In participants without T1D, NGAL and B2M inversely correlated 
with GFR (NGAL r = -0.18; P = 0.13 and B2M r = -0.49; P < 0.0001) and with ERPF 
(NGAL r = -0.19; P = 0.1 and B2M r = -0.42; P = 0.0003), and correlated 
positively with RA (NGAL r = 0.19; P = 0.10 and B2M r = 0.3; P = 0.01) and with 
RVR (NGAL r = 0.20; P = 0.09 and B2M r = 0.34; P = 0.003). Differences were 
significant after adjusting for age, sex, HbA1c, SBP and LDL. There were 
statistical interactions between T1D status, B2M and intrarenal haemodynamic 
function (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated NGAL relates to intrarenal haemodynamic dysfunction in 
T1D, whereas elevated NGAL and B2M relate to intrarenal haemodynamic dysfunction 
in adults without T1D. These data may define a diabetes-specific interplay 
between tubular injury and intrarenal haemodynamic dysfunction.

MicroRNA-455-5p (miR-455-5p) seems to have an anti-inflammatory role in the 
immune system since its expression is induced by IL-10 cytokine. Multiple 
sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating neurodegenerative disease of the 
central nervous system that is caused by an autoimmune inflammatory attack 
against the myelin insulation of neurons. The expression level of miR-455-5p and 
its role in MS pathogenesis has yet to be elucidated. We found that miR-455-5p 
expression was highly correlated with disease severity in MS patients. 
miR-455-5p expression inversely correlates with its inflammatory-predicted 
targets (MyD88 and REL) in relapse- and remitting-phase patients. Luciferase 
assays confirm that MyD88 and REL are direct targets of miR-455-5p. This study 
represents the first report of the miR-455-5p acts as an anti-inflammatory role 
in MS, at least partially through targeting MyD88 and REL. This study may 
provide important information for the use of miR-455-5p as a novel strategy to 
improve the severity of disease and control inflammation and attack in MS 
patients.

PURPOSE: To study the outcomes of uneventful cataract surgery in diabetic 
patients without retinal complications.
DESIGN: A post hoc treatment analysis using data from 2 double-masked randomized 
clinical trials.
METHODS: Setting: Conducted at Kymenlaakso Central Hospital, Kotka, Finland.
PROCEDURE: A total of 276 eyes of 266 patients undergoing routine cataract 
surgery were included in the study. Patients with type I or II diabetes (n = 56 
eyes) were compared to nondiabetic patients (n = 220 eyes). Clinical evaluation 
was conducted by the operating physician, and outcome measures taken before 
surgery and day 28 were recorded by a research technician.
RESULTS: Patient age, sex distribution, and all baseline ophthalmic and surgical 
parameters were comparable for the nondiabetic and diabetic patient groups. 
Increase in aqueous flare 6.3 ± 16.4 photon units (pu)/ms vs 3.7 ± 8.9 pu/ms 
(mean ± standard deviation; P = .282), central retinal thickness (CRT) 12.0 ± 
38.2 μm vs 5.9 ± 15.8 μm (P = .256), corrected distance visual acuity 0.57 ± 
0.31 decimals vs 0.53 ± 0.35 decimals (P = .259), and patient satisfaction 9.3 ± 
0.9 vs 9.2 ± 1.1 (P = .644) were comparable for nondiabetic and diabetic 
patients. In eyes with steroid monotherapy (n = 64), CRT increased 38.1 ± 
72.8 μm in nondiabetic patients compared to 7.8 ± 6.6 μm in diabetic ones (P = 
.010). In eyes with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) monotherapy (n = 
157), CRT increased 5.7 ± 18.4 μm in nondiabetic patients compared to 6.2 ± 
20.5 μm in diabetic ones (P = .897). Among eyes with steroid and NSAID 
combination therapy (n = 55), CRT increased 3.6 ± 4.1 μm in nondiabetic patients 
compared to 2.9 ± 3.2 μm in diabetic ones (P = .606). At 28 days postsurgery, 
pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (PCME) was reported in 8 eyes, of which 7 
were in nondiabetic patients (P = 1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients showed less change in CRT when compared to 
controls in steroid monotherapy. Other outcome measurements shows no statistical 
differences.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate the serum anti-hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
antibody positive rate in patients with different types of chronic hepatitis 
(CH) or cirrhosis.
METHODS: A total of 1751 hospitalized patients were chart reviewed, who were 
diagnosed with mono-CH or cirrhosis between 2011 and 2016.
RESULTS: The total anti-HEV-IgG positive rate was 1.33% (13/981) in CH patients, 
which was significantly lower than that (6.49%; 50/770) in cirrhosis patients 
(odds ratio [OR], 4.78 [2.51-9.10]; P = 0.00). The comparison of positive rate 
of anti-HEV-IgG between the same etiology CH and cirrhosis groups was as 
follows: chronic hepatitis B 1.27% (10/790) versus hepatitis B virus 
(HBV)-related cirrhosis 4.21% (22/522) (OR, 3.04 [1.36-6.77]; P = 0.00); chronic 
alcoholic hepatitis 1.41% (1/71) versus alcoholic cirrhosis 9.40% (11/117) (OR, 
8.00 [1.00-64.25]; P = 0.03); chronic autoimmune hepatitis 1.69% (1/59) versus 
autoimmune cirrhosis 13.33% (12/90) (OR, 13.11 [1.49-115.27]; P = 0.01); the 
differences above were statistically significant. And chronic hepatitis C 3.23% 
(1/31) versus hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis 10.81% (4/37) (OR, 4.40 
[0.45-43.53]; P > 0.05); chronic NASH 0.00% (0/30) versus NASH-related cirrhosis 
25.00% (1/4) (P > 0.05), the differences were not statistically significant. 
Anti-HEV-IgG positive rates were also compared among different types of CH 
groups and no significant difference was found. Likewise, anti-HEV-IgG positive 
rate was compared among different types of cirrhosis groups, showing that the 
positive rates of both alcoholic cirrhosis (9.40%) and autoimmune cirrhosis 
(13.33%) were significantly higher than that of HBV-related cirrhosis (4.21%) 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We observed that the cirrhosis patients had a significantly higher 
anti-HEV-IgG positive rate comparing with the CH patients, especially in those 
with HBV-related, alcohol-related, and autoimmune-related cirrhosis (after 
adjusted for age). Additionally, it seems that the conditions of alcoholic 
cirrhosis and autoimmune cirrhosis are more susceptible to HEV infection due to 
the significantly higher positive anti-HEV-IgG rate in these patients.

AIMS: To assess the impact of social deprivation, demographics and centre on 
HbA1c outcomes with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in adults 
with Type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: Demographic data, postcode-derived English Index of Multiple 
Deprivation data and 12-month average HbA1c (mmol/mol) pre- and post-CSII were 
collated from three diabetes centres in the north west of England, University 
Hospital of South Manchester (UHSM), Salford Royal Foundation Hospital (SRFT) 
and Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI). Univariable and multivariable regression 
models explored relationships between demographics, Index of Multiple 
Deprivation, centre and HbA1c outcomes.
RESULTS: Data were available for 693 (78%) individuals (UHSM, n = 90; SRFT, 
n = 112; and MRI, n = 491) of whom 59% were women. Median age at CSII start was 
39 (IQR 29.5-49.0) years and median diabetes duration was 20 (11-29) years. 
Median Index of Multiple Deprivation was 15 193 (6313-25 727). Overall median 
HbA1c improved from 69 to 64 mmol/mol (8.5% to 8.0%) within the first year of 
CSII. In multivariable analysis, higher pre-CSII HbA1c was significantly 
associated with higher deprivation (P = 0.036), being female (P < 0.001), and 
centre (MRI; P = 0.005). Following pre-CSII HbA1c adjustment, post-CSII HbA1c or 
HbA1c change were not related to demographic factors and deprivation, but 
remained significantly related to the centre; UHSM and SRFT had larger 
reductions in HbA1c with CSII compared with MRI [median -7.0 (-0.6%) vs. -6.0 
(-0.55%) vs. -4.5 (-0.45%) mmol/mol; P = 0.005].
CONCLUSIONS: Higher pre-CSII HbA1c levels were associated with higher 
deprivation and being female. CSII improves HbA1c irrespective of social 
deprivation and demographics. Significant differences in HbA1c improvements were 
observed between centres. Further work is warranted to explain these differences 
and minimize variation in clinical outcomes with CSII.

Systemic autoimmune diseases are characterized by the overexpression of type I 
IFN stimulated genes, and accumulating evidence indicate a role for type I IFNs 
in these diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms for this are still poorly 
understood. To explore the role of type I IFN regulated miRNAs in systemic 
autoimmune disease, we characterized cellular expression of miRNAs during both 
acute and chronic type I IFN responses. We identified a T cell-specific 
reduction of miR-31-5p levels, both after intramuscular injection of IFNβ and in 
patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SjS). To interrogate the role of miR-31-51p in 
T cells we transfected human CD4+ T cells with a miR-31-5p inhibitor and 
performed metabolic measurements. This identified an increase in basal levels of 
glucose metabolism after inhibition of miR-31-5p. Furthermore, treatment with 
IFN-α also increased the basal levels of human CD4+ T-cell metabolism. In all, 
our results suggest that reduced levels of miR-31-5p in T cells of SjS patients 
support autoimmune T-cell responses during chronic type I IFN exposure.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Although a beneficial effect of selenium (Se) 
administration has been proposed in adults with autoimmune thyroiditis (AT), 
there is a paucity of similar data in children and adolescents. The purpose of 
the study was to investigate whether administration of a high dose of organic Se 
(200 μg daily as l-selenomethionine) has an effect on antithyroid antibody 
titres in children and adolescents with AT.
METHODS: Seventy-one (71) children and adolescents, with a mean age of 
11.3 ± 0.3 years (range 4.5-17.8), diagnosed with AT (antibodies against thyroid 
peroxidase [anti-TPO] and/or thyroglobulin [anti-Tg] ≥60 IU/mL, euthyroidism or 
treated hypothyroidism and goitre in thyroid gland ultrasonography) were 
randomized to receive 200 μg l-selenomethionine or placebo daily for 6 months. 
Blood samples were drawn for measurement of serum fT4, TSH, anti-TPO and anti-Tg 
levels, and thyroid gland ultrasonography was performed at the entry to the 
study and after 6 months of treatment.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: At the end of the study, a statistically significantly 
higher reduction in anti-Tg levels was observed in the Se group compared to the 
placebo group (Δ: -70.9 ± 22.1 vs -6.7 ± 60.6 IU/mL, P = 0.021). Although 
anti-TPO levels were also decreased in the Se group, this change was not 
statistically different from that of the control group (Δ: -116.2 ± 68.4 vs 
+262.8 ± 255.5 IU/mL, P = 0.219). No significant difference in thyroid gland 
volume was observed between the two study groups (P > 0.05).
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In this original study, organic Se supplementation 
appears to reduce anti-Tg levels in children and adolescents with AT.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of the EUVAS-proposed histopathological 
classification of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated 
glomerulonephritis has been evaluated throughout the world. Here, we performed a 
Japanese nationwide biopsy survey to assess the association between this 
histopathological classification and renal prognosis after 2-year follow-up in 
ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis.
METHODS: We collected 67 renal biopsy materials of the 321 entries in the 
RemIT-JAV-RPGN cohort study, and assessed their histologies. Based on the 
EUVAS-proposed histopathological classification and some histological 
parameters, we statistically evaluated renal survival and the comparison of 
renal function for 2 years.
RESULTS: Based on the histopathological classification, the largest number of 
biopsy samples belonged to the Focal class, followed by the Mixed, Crescentic, 
and Sclerotic classes (n = 30, 19, 10, 8, respectively). Although the number of 
events might be too low (four patients with renal death) to make this 
conclusion, the Focal and Mixed classes had higher renal-survival rates compared 
to the others in the renal-survival curve. Comparing renal function among all 
classes, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) throughout 2-year 
follow-up period was significantly higher in the Focal class compared to the 
other 3 classes. The eGFR-values in the Crescentic, Mixed, and Sclerotic classes 
increased with time. Based on both combined results, the Focal class could be 
the best prognosis.
CONCLUSION: This histopathological classification was valuable for both the 
stratification of renal function and the estimation of partial renal survival 
during 2-year follow-up in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or undifferentiated arthritis (UA) in 
the CONAART database (Argentine Consortium for Early Arthritis) were assessed 
for genetic risk factors for RA, specifically for HLA-DRB1 alleles and the 
PTPN22 rs2476601 polymorphism associated with progression to RA. This is a 
case-control study. Blood samples were obtained to determine HLA-DRB1 genotypes 
by PCR-SSO Luminex and PTPN22 (rs2476601) polymorphism by allelic 
discrimination. A control group of individuals from the general Argentinian 
population were obtained from the national register of cadaveric organ donors. A 
total of 1859 individuals were included in this analysis: 399 patients from the 
CONAART database (347 patients with RA at study end and 52 patients with UA at 
study end, mean follow-up time 25 ± 18 months) and 1460 individuals from the 
general Argentinian population. Compared with the controls, the HLA-DRB1*04 and 
DRB1*09 alleles were more commonly detected in patients with RA diagnosis (OR 
(95% CI) 2.23 (1.74-2.85) and 1.89 (1.26-2.81)) respectively. Both patients with 
UA and the general population showed higher frequency of DRB1*07, DRB1*11 and 
DRB1*15 alleles than patients with RA. PTPN22 rs2476601 polymorphism frequency 
was higher in RA and UA vs the general population; however, this was 
significantly different only for RA vs control group (OR [95% CI] = 1.81 
[1.10-3.02], P = 0.018. HLA-DRB1 typing and PTPN22 allelic discrimination could 
distinguish between patients with UA, patients with early RA, and the general 
population in Argentina. This is the first study of HLA-DRB1 alleles and PTPN22 
polymorphism associations with progression to early RA in an Argentinian 
population.

AIMS: The Oxford Classification E score (endocapillary hypercellularity) 
predicts renal functional decline in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients free from 
steroid/immunosuppressive (IS) therapy, but is poorly reproducible. We 
hypothesise that endocapillary hypercellularity reflects glomerular inflammation 
and that the presence of CD68-positive cells is a more robust marker of E score.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CD68-positive cells were quantified in glomeruli and 
tubulointerstitium in biopsies from 118 IgAN patients, and cell counts were 
correlated with the criteria of the Oxford Classification, assigned on 
PAS-stained serial sections. There was a strong correlation between median 
glomerular CD68 count and the percentage of glomeruli showing endocapillary 
hypercellularity (r = 0.67; P < 0.001; r2  = 0.45), while there was no 
correlation between CD68-positive cells and mesangial hypercellularity, % 
segmental sclerosis, % of crescents and % tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis 
(TA/IF). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that a maximum glomerular CD68 count of 
6 is the best cut-off for distinguishing E0 from E1 (sensitivity 94.1%, 
specificity 71%, area under the curve = 89%). Identification of biopsies with a 
maximum glomerular CD68-count >6 was reproducible (kappa score 0.8), and there 
was a strong correlation between glomerular CD68 counts obtained by conventional 
light microscopy and by image analysis (r = 0.80, r2  = 0.64, P < 0.0001). 
Digital image analysis revealed that tubulointerstitial CD68-positive cells 
correlated moderately with % TA/IF (r = 0.59, r2  = 0.35, P < 0.001) and GFR at 
the time of biopsy (r = 0.54, r2  = 0.29, P < 0.0001), but not with mesangial 
and endocapillary hypercellularity.
CONCLUSIONS: While glomerular CD68-positive cells emerge as markers of 
endocapillary hypercellularity, their tubulointerstitial counterparts are 
associated with chronic damage.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in 
all age groups and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with T1DM in 
Korea were estimated.
METHODS: The incidence and prevalence of T1DM between 2007 and 2013 were 
calculated using the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) datasets of 
claims. Clinical characteristics and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in 
individuals with T1DM between 2009 and 2013 were determined using the database 
of NHIS preventive health checkups.
RESULTS: The prevalence of T1DM in Korea between 2007 and 2013 was 0.041% to 
0.047%. The annual incidence rate of T1DM in Korea in 2007 to 2013 was 2.73 to 
5.02/100,000 people. Although the incidence rate of typical T1DM was highest in 
teenagers, it remained steady in adults over 30 years of age. In contrast, the 
incidence rate of atypical T1DM in 2013 was higher in people aged 40 years or 
older than in younger age groups. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of metabolic 
syndrome in patients with T1DM was 51.65% to 55.06% between 2009 and 2013.
CONCLUSION: T1DM may be more common in Korean adults than previously believed. 
Metabolic syndrome may be a frequent finding in individuals with T1DM in Korea.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adiponectin is a cytokine linking energy metabolism and 
immune system. After being assembled, adiponectin circulates as oligomers of 
different molecular weight, i.e. low, medium and high (HMW) molecular weight. 
These have the most potent biological effects. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an 
autoimmune disease of the human central nervous system. The aim of this study 
was to characterize the expression levels of both total adiponectin and its 
oligomerization state in the serum from 99 patients with MS at baseline (i.e. 
not influenced by therapies). We also investigated the potential relationships 
between adiponectin and disease progression and severity.
METHODS: Adiponectin was quantified and visualized by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, western blotting and fast protein liquid chromatography. 
During the follow-up (3.6 ± 2.20 years), the patients were evaluated using total 
annualized relapse rate and Expanded Disability Status Scale score.
RESULTS: Total adiponectin is statistically higher in patients with MS compared 
with matched controls (12.18 vs. 10.02 μg/mL, P = 0.001). Interestingly, the 
adiponectin oligomerization state is altered in MS, with an increase of HMW 
oligomers. In addition, patients with MS with higher levels of adiponectin at 
baseline have significantly higher risk of progression and severity (Multiple 
Sclerosis Severity Score, 3.84 vs. 2.44, P = 0.001). No statistical difference 
in adiponectin expression was found between active and inactive patients with MS 
and among the different forms of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that adiponectin and its HMW oligomers are 
greatly involved in MS autoimmune disorder representing a potential biomarker to 
predict worse MS prognosis and severity. Further studies are required to clarify 
the molecular mechanisms underlying the properties of adiponectin and HMW 
oligomers in MS.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our objective was to study the association between the 
presence of a neurological disease and the comorbidity burden as well as 
healthcare utilization (HCU).
METHODS: Using baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging 
(CLSA), we examined the burden of five neurological conditions. The CLSA is a 
population-based study of approximately 50 000 individuals, aged 45-85 years at 
baseline. We used multivariable Poisson regression to identify correlates of 
comorbidity burden and HCU.
RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of five neurological diseases is presented: 
epilepsy, Parkinson's disease/parkinsonism, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, 
multiple sclerosis and migraine. We found the somatic and psychiatric 
comorbidity burden to be higher in those individuals with a neurological disease 
(an 18-45% mean increase in the number of chronic conditions) as compared with 
the comparison group without a neurological disease, except for Parkinson's 
disease/parkinsonism. The presence of a neurological disease was associated with 
only a modest increase in the probability of visiting a general practitioner but 
was associated with a greatly increased probability of visiting a medical 
specialist (up to 68% more likely) or an emergency department (up to 79% more 
likely) and an overnight hospitalization (up to 108% more likely).
CONCLUSIONS: We found striking associations between our neurological diseases 
and increased comorbidity burdens and HCU. These findings are important for 
informing public policy planning as well as driving avenues for future research. 
The present study established the CLSA as an important research platform for the 
study of neurological conditions in an aging general population.

Large-vessel inflammation, although rare, has been increasingly recognised as a 
complication of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) in recent years. The 
presentation is highly variable, ranging from an incidental finding to aortic 
dissection and rupture. Treatment has predominately consisted of a combination 
of cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids with surgical intervention 
when indicated. We present the case of a 34-year-old male diagnosed with GPA 
after presenting with sinus and eye inflammation and the ensuing investigation 
revealed large vessel involvement that remarkably improved after 6 months of 
treatment with the combination of rituximab infusions, methotrexate and 
corticosteroids.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment options in primary progressive multiple 
sclerosis (PPMS) are scarce and, with the exception of ocrelizumab, 
anti-inflammatory agents have failed to show efficacy in ameliorating disability 
progression. The aim of this study was to investigate a potential effect of 
anti-inflammatory disease-modifying treatment on disability outcomes in PPMS.
METHODS: Using MSBase, a large, international, observational database, we 
identified patients with PPMS who were either never treated or treated with a 
disease-modifying agent. Propensity score matching was used to select 
subpopulations with similar baseline characteristics. Expanded Disability Status 
Scale (EDSS) outcomes were compared with an intention-to-treat and an as-treated 
approach in paired, pairwise-censored analyses.
RESULTS: Of the 1284 included patients, 533 were matched (treated, n = 195; 
untreated n = 338). Median on-study pairwise-censored follow-up was 3.4 years 
(quartiles 1.2-5.5). No difference in the hazard of experiencing 3-month 
confirmed EDSS progression events was observed between the groups [hazard ratio 
(HR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.6-1.7, P = 0.87]. We did not find 
significant differences in the hazards of confirmed EDSS improvement (HR, 1.0; 
95% CI, 0.6-1.6, P = 0.91) or reaching a confirmed EDSS step ≥7 (HR, 1.1; 95% 
CI, 0.7-1.6, P = 0.69).
CONCLUSION: Our pooled analysis of disease-modifying agents suggests that these 
therapies have no substantial effect on short- to medium-term disability 
outcomes in PPMS.

The intrauterine environment is an important determinant of immunity later in 
life of the offspring. An altered prenatal immune development can result in a 
high postnatal risk for infections, chronic immune diseases, and autoimmunity. 
Many of these immune diseases show a strong sex bias, such as a high incidence 
of autoimmune diseases and allergies in adult females or a high risk for 
infections in males. Here, we comprehensively review established pathways and 
propose novel concepts modulating the risk for such poor immunity during 
childhood and throughout life. Moreover, we highlight how an adverse fetal 
environment may affect or aggravate the risk for poor immunity in a sex-specific 
manner. An improved understanding of a sex-specific susceptibility to poor 
immunity along with insights on how such risk can be modulated before or around 
birth will allow the development of tailored prevention strategies.

OBJECTIVES: A few variants of chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) have been described, but their frequency and 
evolution to typical CIDP remain unclear. To determine the frequency and 
characteristics of the CIDP variants, their possible evolution to typical CIDP, 
and treatment response.
METHODS: We applied a set of diagnostic criteria to 460 patients included in a 
database of Italian patients with CIDP. Clinical characteristics and treatment 
response were reviewed for each patient. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to 
estimate the progression rate from atypical to typical CIDP.
RESULTS: At the time of inclusion, 376 (82%) patients had a diagnosis of typical 
CIDP while 84 (18%) had atypical CIDP, including 34 (7%) with distal acquired 
demyelinating symmetric neuropathy (DADS), 17 (4%) with purely motor, 17 (4%) 
with Lewis-Sumner syndrome (LSS) and 16 (3.5%) with purely sensory CIDP. Based 
on retrospective review of the symptoms and signs present at onset and for at 
least 1 year, 180 (39%) patients had an initial diagnosis compatible with 
atypical CIDP that in 96 (53%) patients evolved to typical CIDP. Mean disease 
duration was longer in patients evolving to typical CIDP than in those not 
evolving (p=0.0016). Patients with DADS and LSS had a less frequent response to 
immunoglobulin than those with typical CIDP, while patients with purely motor 
and sensory CIDP had a similar treatment response.
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients with atypical CIDP varies during the 
disease course. DADS and LSS have a less frequent response to intravenous 
immunoglobulin compared with typical CIDP, raising the possibility of a 
different underlying pathogenetic mechanism.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a progressive inflammatory disease that might 
rarely involve only the lungs. We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative, 
clinical and surgical features of patients with a pathology highly suggestive or 
probable diagnosis of IgG4-RD without extra-thoracic involvement. Five patients 
were selected, 2 were operated on the right side. Positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed an uptake in all the patients 
(median 5.5), and 2 patients had an uptake at the thoracic lymph nodes. Two 
diagnoses were made through a CT-guided needle biopsy, while 3 were determined 
based on a lung wedge resection. The levels of serum IgG4 were elevated 
(>1.35 g/dl) in all the patients. Two patients had a highly suggestive diagnosis 
of IgG4-RD, and 3 patients had a probable diagnosis of IgG4-RD. The differential 
diagnosis between IgG4-RD and lung malignancies based only on radiological 
features is challenging and often requires histological confirmation. A careful 
preoperative workup and a multidisciplinary approach to PET-positive nodules 
might help to avoid unnecessary major lung resections.

This review focuses on the effects of chronic systemic inflammation on skeletal 
muscle and its downstream effect on physical function in individuals with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The importance of skeletal muscle in the regulation 
of whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism, and the benefits and barriers to 
physical activity and exercise training are highlighted. Finally, we identify 
knowledge gaps that may be important for the development of both pharmacologic 
and non-pharmacologic interventions (e.g. proper exercise regimens) to protect 
individuals with RA from physical impairment.

OBJECTIVE: To examine correlations between blood levels of complement split 
product iC3b and serum component C3 with clinically meaningful changes in 
disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: A total of 159 consecutive patients with SLE, diagnosed according to 
the American College of Rheumatology or Systemic Lupus International 
Collaborating Clinics classification criteria, were enrolled in CASTLE 
(Complement Activation Signatures in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), a 
prospective observational study. Patients with 1-7 study visits were included in 
this longitudinal analysis. In addition, 48 healthy volunteers were enrolled to 
establish a normal reference value for the ratio of blood iC3b to serum C3 
concentrations. Serum C3 and C4 levels were measured by nephelometry, and blood 
iC3b levels were measured by a lateral flow assay. SLE disease activity was 
monitored with the Responder Index 50 instrument of the SLE Disease Activity 
Index 2000.
RESULTS: Relative changes in the iC3b:C3 ratio, levels of anti-double-stranded 
DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, and use of a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone 
(>7.5 mg/day) each independently correlated with SLE disease activity, as 
determined in multilevel multiple logistic regression analyses. Only the iC3b:C3 
ratio was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in 
disease activity among patients with SLE who were receiving a supraphysiologic 
dose of prednisone. The iC3b:C3 ratio outperformed C3 and C4 levels with regard 
to discriminating active SLE from inactive SLE, and major flares from no disease 
activity. The iC3:C3 ratio, anti-dsDNA antibody levels, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, and use of a supraphysiologic prednisone dose were each 
independently associated with the presence of lupus nephritis, whereas none of 
these measures was associated with SLE rash. The association of the iC3b:C3 
ratio with lupus nephritis was independent of other observed clinical 
manifestations.
CONCLUSION: The ratio of blood iC3b to serum C3 concentrations correlates with 
the extent of SLE disease activity and with clinically meaningful changes in 
disease activity in patients with SLE. Furthermore, the iC3b:C3 ratio may 
discriminate between active and inactive SLE, and between major flares and no 
active disease.

BACKGROUND: Glomerular immunoglobulin G deposition in patients with 
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) has been shown to be associated with adverse 
renal outcomes. Clinical significance of mesangial immunoglobulin M (IgM) 
deposition in these patients remains to be proven.
METHODS: One hundred patients who had a diagnosis of IgAN between 2001 and 2017 
were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups based on mesangial IgM 
deposition status. Groups were compared for demographic, clinical, and 
pathologic variables at baseline and in follow-up. Cox regression analysis was 
performed to evaluate the effect of mesangial IgM positivity on renal survival.
RESULTS: IgM-positive group included 51% of participants. Baseline demographic 
and clinical parameters were not significantly different between groups. 
Mesangial IgM deposition was significantly associated with a higher segmental 
sclerosis score (p = 0.008). At last visit, median serum creatinine was higher 
(p = 0.021) and eGFR was lower (p = 0.006) in IgM-positive group. Nineteen (19%) 
of all patients reached the combined primary outcome which includes doubling in 
serum creatinine or evolution to ESRD. Cumulative renal survival was lower 
(p = 0.001) and resistant disease was more frequent in IgM-positive group 
(p = 0.026). Renal survival at 15 years was 94.2% and 59.7% in IgM-negative and 
IgM-positive groups, respectively (p = 0.006). Time-averaged proteinuria (HR 
2.9; 95% CI 1.9-4.5; p < 0.001) and mesangial IgM deposition (HR, 13.2; 95% CI 
1.9-93.1; p = 0.01) were found to be independent predictors of unfavorable renal 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we demonstrated that mesangial IgM deposition 
independently associated with worse renal outcomes in patients with IgA 
nephropathy.

Cytosolic DNA of endogenous or exogenous origin is sensed by the cGAS-STING 
pathway to activate innate immune responses. Besides microbial DNA, this pathway 
detects self-DNA in the cytoplasm of damaged or abnormal cells and plays a 
central role in antitumor immunity. The mechanism by which cytosolic DNA 
accumulates under genotoxic stress conditions is currently unclear, but recent 
studies on factors mutated in the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome cells, such as 
SAMHD1, RNase H2 and TREX1, are shedding new light on this key process. In 
particular, these studies indicate that the rupture of micronuclei and the 
release of ssDNA fragments during the processing of stalled replication forks 
and chromosome breaks represent potent inducers of the cGAS-STING pathway.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease leading to the destruction of 
myelin with consequent axonal degeneration and severe physical debilitation. The 
disease can be treated with immunosuppressive drugs that alleviate the symptoms 
and retard disease aggravation. One such drug in clinical use is glatiramer 
acetate (Copaxone). The non-psychotropic immunosuppressive cannabinoid compound 
cannabidiol (CBD) has recently been shown to have beneficial effects on 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The aim of our study was to 
compare the efficacy of CBD and standardized extracts from a CBD-rich, 
∆9-THClowCannabis indica subspecies (Avidekel) with that of Copaxone. Our data 
show that CBD and purified Avidekel extracts are as efficient as Copaxone to 
alleviate the symptoms of proteolipid protein (PLP)-induced EAE in SJL/J mice. 
No synergistic effect was observed by combining CBD or Avidekel extracts with 
Copaxone. Our data support the use of Avidekel extracts in the treatment of MS 
symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: Several multiple sclerosis studies matching self- and physician 
assessment of disease course and disability show moderate and high agreement 
respectively. However, the role played by socio-demographic, clinical, and 
quality of life (QoL) factors was not much investigated. The study aims at 
exploring how self-/physician agreement could depend on these variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were asked to report own disease course and 
disability according to preset categories. Kappa-value and confidence interval 
(CI) for disease course and two-way random interclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC) and CI for disability were calculated to evaluate self-/physician 
agreement. Χ2 was applied to examine whether other factors (gender, age, 
education, civil status, disease duration, fatigue, quality of life) had 
systematic effects.
RESULTS: Data analysis on 203 participants indicated fair agreement 
(Kappa-value = 0.30; 95% CI 0.23-0.38) and no dependency on the categories of 
each variable for disease course. Satisfactory correlation was found for 
disability (ICC = 0.74; 95% IC 0.67-0.80), good agreement was found for almost 
all variable categories, and significant differences were observed for education 
(better agreement for higher levels), disease duration, fatigue and QoL (better 
agreement for worse conditions).
DISCUSSION: Results seem to suggest that higher education and worse clinical and 
QoL conditions could engage the patient in developing more disease awareness and 
realistic self-perception and self-evaluation.

multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) is the only enzyme capable of reducing toxic 
lipid hydroperoxides in biological membranes to the corresponding alcohols using 
glutathione as the electron donor. GPx4 is the major inhibitor of ferroptosis, a 
non-apoptotic and iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway, which has been 
shown to occur in various neurological disorders with severe oxidative stress. 
In this study, we investigate whether GPx4 expression is altered in multiple 
sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). 
The results clearly show that mRNA expression for all three GPx4 isoforms 
(cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and nuclear) decline in multiple sclerosis gray 
matter and in the spinal cord of MOG35-55 peptide-induced EAE. The amount of 
GPx4 protein is also reduced in EAE, albeit not in all cells. Neuronal GPx4 
immunostaining, mostly cytoplasmic, is lower in EAE spinal cords than in control 
spinal cords, while oligodendrocyte GPx4 immunostaining, mainly nuclear, is 
unaltered. Neither control nor EAE astrocytes and microglia cells show GPx4 
labeling. In addition to GPx4, two other negative modulators of ferroptosis 
(γ-glutamylcysteine ligase and cysteine/glutamate antiporter), which are 
critical to maintain physiological levels of glutathione, are diminished in EAE. 
The decrease in the ability to eliminate hydroperoxides was also evidenced by 
the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and the reduction in the 
proportion of the docosahexaenoic acid in non-myelin lipids. These findings, 
along with presence of abnormal neuronal mitochondria morphology, which includes 
an irregular matrix, disrupted outer membrane and reduced/absent cristae, are 
consistent with the occurrence of ferroptotic damage in inflammatory 
demyelinating disorders.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are currently the largest and fastest growing class 
of biopharmaceuticals, and they address unmet medical needs, e.g., in oncology 
and in auto-immune diseases. Their clinical efficacy and safety is significantly 
affected by the structure and composition of their glycosylation profile which 
is commonly heterogeneous, heavily dependent on the manufacturing process, and 
thus susceptible to variations in the cell culture conditions. Glycosylation is 
therefore considered a critical quality attribute for mAbs. Commonly, in 
currently marketed therapeutic mAbs, the glycosylation profile is suboptimal in 
terms of biological properties such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity or may give rise to safety concerns due to the presence of 
non-human glycans. This article will review recent innovative developments in 
chemo-enzymatic glycoengineering, which allow generating mAbs carrying single, 
well-defined, uniform Fc glycoforms, which confers the desired biological 
properties for the target application. This approach offers significant benefits 
such as enhanced Fc effector functions, improved safety profiles, higher 
batch-to-batch consistency, decreased risks related to immunogenicity and 
manufacturing process changes, and the possibility to manufacture mAbs, in an 
economical manner, in non-mammalian expression systems. Overall, this approach 
could facilitate and reduce mAb manufacturing costs which in turn would 
translate into tangible benefits for both patients and manufacturers. The first 
glycoengineered mAbs are about to enter clinical trials and it is expected that, 
once glycoengineering reagents are available at affordable costs, and in-line 
with regulatory requirements, that targeted remodeling of antibody Fc 
glycosylation will become an integral part in manufacturing the next-generation 
of immunotherapeutics.

Erratum in
    Pharmacogenomics J. 2019 Feb 14;:

The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate whether 47 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in steroid hormone-related genes are associated with the 
risk of RA and anti-TNF drug response. We conducted a case-control study in 3 
European populations including 2936 RA patients and 2197 healthy controls. Of 
those, a total of 1985 RA patients were treated with anti-TNF blockers. The 
association of potentially interesting markers in the discovery population was 
validated through meta-analysis with data from DREAM and DANBIO registries. 
Although none of the selected variants had a relevant role in modulating RA 
risk, the meta-analysis of the linear regression data with those from the DREAM 
and DANBIO registries showed a significant correlation of the CYP3A4rs11773597 
and CYP2C9rs1799853 variants with changes in DAS28 after the administration of 
anti-TNF drugs (P = 0.00074 and P = 0.006, respectively). An overall haplotype 
analysis also showed that the ESR2GGG haplotype significantly associated with a 
reduced chance of having poor response to anti-TNF drugs (P = 0.0009). Finally, 
a ROC curve analysis confirmed that a model built with eight steroid 
hormone-related variants significantly improved the ability to predict drug 
response compared with the reference model including demographic and clinical 
variables (AUC = 0.633 vs. AUC = 0.556; PLR_test = 1.52 × 10-6). These data 
together with those reporting that the CYP3A4 and ESR2 SNPs correlate with the 
expression of TRIM4 and ESR2 mRNAs in PBMCs (ranging from P = 1.98 × 10-6 to 
P = 2.0 × 10-35), and that the CYP2C9rs1799853 SNP modulates the efficiency of 
multiple drugs, suggest that steroid hormone-related genes may have a role in 
determining the response to anti-TNF drugs.KEY POINTS• Polymorphisms within the 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 loci correlate with changes in DAS28 after treatment with 
anti-TNF drugs.• A haplotype including eQTL SNPs within the ESR2 gene associates 
with better response to anti-TNF drugs.• A genetic model built with eight 
steroid hormone-related variants significantly improved the ability to predict 
drug response.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risk and predictors of autoimmune diseases 
in children and adults.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, predictors, and excess costs of 
autoimmune disease in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of the 2002-2012 National Inpatient Sample, which 
includes a ∼20% sample of all US hospitalizations (n = 87,053,155 adults and 
children).
RESULTS: The prevalence of autoimmune disease was higher in adults with AD 
(7.9%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 7.3-8.5%) than without AD (5.7%, 95% CI 
5.7%-5.8%) and higher in children with AD (2.0%, 95% CI 1.7%-2.3%) than without 
AD (1.0%, 95% CI 0.9%-1.1%). In multivariable logistic regression models 
controlling for sociodemographics, adult (adjusted odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI 
1.32-1.58) and pediatric (adjusted odds ratio 2.08, 95% CI 1.73-2.50) AD were 
associated with any autoimmune disorder. In particular, AD was associated with 
18 of 32 autoimmune disorders examined in adults and 13 of 24 examined in 
children, including disorders of the skin, endocrine, gastrointestinal, 
hematologic, and musculoskeletal systems. AD patients hospitalized with any 
autoimmune disorder had a higher cost of inpatient care, with $2.5-$50 million 
excess annual costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults and children with AD had increased cutaneous and 
extracutaneous autoimmune disorders, which were associated with a considerable 
cost burden.

OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the health and health-care patterns of 
patients with diabetes according to their estimated glomerular filtration rates, 
especially within a publicly funded health-care system.
METHODS: Using linked health-care databases in Ontario, Canada, we performed a 
population-based study of adults 50 years of age and older (mean age, 68 years) 
with prevalent diabetes on January 1, 2014. We categorized patients according to 
their levels of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90, 60 to 
89, 30 to 59, 15 to 29 or <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, or the receipt of ongoing 
maintenance dialysis). We then followed patients for 2 years to determine: 1) 
their level of contact with health-care providers (i.e. visits to family 
doctors, specialists); 2) their use and repeated use of acute medical services 
(i.e. hospitalizations and emergency department encounters; 3) diabetes-related 
monitoring and screening (i.e. glycated hemoglobin and cholesterol tests, vision 
screening); 4) glycemic and lipid control; and 5) diabetes-related outcomes.
RESULTS: There were 569,384 patients in our study. Most had estimated glomerular 
filtration rates between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, patients with 
lower kidney function had longer durations of diabetes and more comorbidities. 
Over 2 years of follow up, they had higher burdens of medical care, excessive 
diabetes monitoring and were underscreened for diabetes-related complications. 
Although metabolic control was reasonable across groups, patients with low 
kidney function had more hospital encounters and more diabetes-related 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes and low kidney function are a vulnerable 
population that faces health system challenges and care gaps. Suggestions for 
policy and practice are discussed.

The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of symptoms of 
depression and insomnia among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 
osteoarthritis in comparison with individuals without chronic diseases. The 
study was carried out at National Institute of Geriatrics, Rheumatology and 
Rehabilitation, included 229 persons. The participants were divided into the 
following groups: group I - 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, group II - 
58 patients with osteoarthritis, group III - 51 healthy individuals no confirmed 
depression (control group). Symptoms of depression were confirmed by a 
multiple-choice self-reported Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire. Symptoms 
of depression confirmed with depression inventory≥ 10 occurred as follows: 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis - 75.83%, patients with osteoarthritis - 50%, 
control group - 23.53% (p<0.0001), with the prevalence of insomnia (AIS≥6) at: 
71%, 32% and 33%, respectively (p<0.001). In group I mean values of FIRST and 
AIS were 23.06 and 8.36 respectively, with group II: 21.71 and 7.84, 
respectively. In all subjects with AIS≥6, the depression inventory was 
statistically significantly (p<0.005) higher than in the subjects with AIS<6 
(respectively: 17.02 vs 12.13; 15.6 vs 8.05; 5.45 vs 1.81). Patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis find it difficult to cope with stress. Insomnia as a 
reaction to stress occurs more often in this group.

OBJECTIVES: We used an unbiased proteomics approach to identify candidate urine 
biomarkers (CUBMs) predictive of LN chronicity and pursued their validation in a 
larger cohort.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional pilot study, we selected urine collected at 
kidney biopsy from 20 children with varying levels of LN damage (discovery 
cohort) and performed proteomic analysis using isobaric tags for relative and 
absolute quantification (iTRAQ). We identified differentially excreted proteins 
based on degree of LN chronicity and sought to distinguish markers exhibiting 
different relative expression patterns using hierarchically clustered 
log10-normalized relative abundance data with linked and distinct functions by 
biological network analyses. For each CUBM, we performed specific ELISAs on 
urine from a validation cohort (n = 41) and analysis of variance to detect 
differences between LN chronicity, with LN activity adjustment. We evaluated for 
CUBM expression in LN biopsies with immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: iTRAQ detected 112 proteins in urine from the discovery cohort, 51 
quantifiable in all replicates. Simple analysis of variance revealed four 
differentially expressed, chronicity-correlated proteins (P-values < 0.05). 
Further correlation and network analyses led to selection of seven CUBMs for LN 
chronicity. In the validation cohort, none of the CUBMs distinguished LN 
chronicity degree; however, urine SERPINA3 demonstrated a moderate positive 
correlation with LN histological activity. Immunohistochemistry further 
demonstrated SERPINA3 staining in proximal tubular epithelial and endothelial 
cells.
CONCLUSION: We identified SERPINA3, a known inhibitor of neutrophil cathepsin G 
and angiotensin II production, as a potential urine biomarker to help quantify 
LN activity.

Follicular helper T(Tfh) cells and follicular regulatory T(Tfr) cells are 
critical for the development and maintenance of germinal center and humoral 
immune responses. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the dysregulation 
of either Tfh or Tfr cells contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune 
diseases. The aim of this study was to examine the numbers of Tfh and Tfr cells 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Twenty-four patients with RA 
patients and 20 health controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. We analyzed 
the numbers of Tfh (CD4+ CXCR5+ PD-1hi) cells and Tfr (CD4+ CXCR5+CD127lo) cells 
in 24 RA patients via flow cytometry. The level of the soluble PD-1 and its 
ligands (sPD-L1 and sPDL-2) were examined by ELISA. Flow cytometry revealed that 
both circulating Tfh and Tfr cells were increased in RA patients compared with 
HCs. More importantly, the ratio of Tfr/Tfh was decreased, indicating a 
disruption of the balance between Tfh and Tfr. The Tfr/Tfh ratio was inversely 
correlated with level of serum CRP, ESR, RF, anti-CCP, IgG and DAS28 index. We 
also found that the serum level of sPD-1 was significantly elevated in the RA 
patients, which was positively correlated with CRP, ESR and the number of Tfh 
cells. These results indicate that an imbalance of circulating Tfr and Tfh cells 
may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of RA and may provide novel insight 
for the development of RA therapies.

PURPOSE: To examine the outcome of the use of donor sclera as spacer material in 
complicated cases of strabismus surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study on patients with complicated 
thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) (n = 42) or congenital strabismus 
(n = 75). Patients underwent strabismus surgery during 1994-2014. The surgical 
results were evaluated in terms of the reduction in the angle of deviation, the 
need for re-operation, complications and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: The majority of the TAO patients underwent surgery for vertical 
strabismus (n = 25). The vertical angle of deviation in the primary position was 
significantly reduced from a median of 23 prism dioptres (PD) to 2 PD (n = 35, 
p < 0.001). The horizontal angle of deviation in primary position for TAO 
patients with esotropia was significantly reduced, from a median of 35 PD to 2 
PD (n = 17, p < 0.001). The majority of the congenital cases had horizontal 
strabismus (esotropia = 29, exotropia = 27). The angle of deviation in esotropia 
was reduced from a median of 29 PD to 8 PD (n = 36, p < 0.001) and in exotropia 
from 30 PD to 10 PD (n = 34, p < 0.001). Most of the patients were satisfied 
with the outcome of surgery, and only 12% required re-operation within 2 years.
CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical study on the use of donor sclera as 
spacer material in complicated cases of strabismus surgery. The surgical results 
were good in terms of the reduction in the angle of deviation, the need for 
re-operation, complications and patient satisfaction, supporting the use of 
donor sclera for strabismus surgery.

It is frequently accepted that grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) are efficient 
antioxidants and beneficial in improving cognitive functions. However, diabetes 
(T1DM)-associated declines in learning and memory and the possibilities of GSPs 
in overcoming this loss needs to be examined. The present study was designed to 
examine the correlation, if one exists, between cognitive behavior and neuronal 
survival in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic 
Wistar rats as well as to further clarify whether the correlation exists. Also 
this study aimed to determine whether neurological structural changes in the PFC 
and pancreatic β-cells can be restored by grape seed proanthocyanidin extract 
(GSPE). At the end of 8 weeks, cognitive tests that rats given supplementation 
of GSPE and insulin had greater improvement in their spatial learning and memory 
skills and improved neuronal survival in the PFC and pancreatic β-cells compared 
to rats supplemented with either insulin or GSPE alone. Expression of Bax in the 
PFC was increased in the diabetic rats while Bcl-2 expression was decreased, and 
GSPE and insulin treatment reversed the expression of apoptotic proteins. Our 
findings on GSPE, a natural product, as a form of adjuvant therapy together with 
insulin treatment is suggestive of the existence of synergism between the two in 
attenuating diabetic complications in the pancreas and PFC.

Antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as 'Hughes Syndrome', is an autoimmune 
disease characterised by a set of clinical manifestations, almost all of which 
are direct or indirect sequelae of a hypercoagulable state involving the venous, 
and to a lesser extent the arterial vasculature. The incidence and prevalence of 
antiphospholipid syndrome are estimated at approximately 5 de novo cases per 100 
000 per year and 40-50 cases per 100 000 individuals, respectively. The clinical 
spectrum of antiphospholipid syndrome involves haematological 
(thrombocytopaenia, venous thrombosis), obstetrical (recurrent pregnancy loss), 
neurological (stroke, transient ischaemic attack, migraine, seizures, cognitive 
dysfunction, chorea, transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis), cardiovascular 
(cardiac valve disease), dermatological (livedo reticularis and racemosa, skin 
ulceration and necrosis), renal (glomerulonephritis, renal thrombotic 
microangiopathy) and orthopaedic (avascular necrosis of bones, non-traumatic 
fractures) manifestations, among others. In addition to the classical 
antiphospholipid antibodies, namely anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus 
anticoagulant, new autoantibodies and antibody complexes of different 
immunoglobulin subtypes (IgA, IgG, IgM) are now recognised as significant 
contributors to the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome. Anticoagulation 
remains the cornerstone in the management of antiphospholipid syndrome; 
nevertheless, new drugs and therapeutic strategies are being tested, and some 
have been found effective for the primary and secondary thromboprophylaxis in 
antiphospholipid syndrome.

In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of imatinib on the proliferation 
of rheumatoid arthritis synovial cell (RA-FLS) and inflammatory responses by 
regulating CSF1R. Differential genes were screened via microarray analysis, 
followed by being analysed through the weighted co-expression network (WGCNA) 
network, that included module and cluster analysis. The relationship between 
imatinib and genes was visualized using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of 
Interacting Genes (STITCH) database. Expressions of mRNA and protein were 
determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 
Western blot, respectively. Cell viability was examined via clone formation 
assay, while cell cycle and apoptosis were analysed through flow cytometry 
analysis. The hub gene CSF1R was ultimately determined by microarray analysis 
and WGCNA analysis. Colony-stimulating-factor receptor-1 (SF1R) was highly 
expressed in rheumatoid arthritis tissues and cells, and CSF1R over-expression 
could promote inflammatory responses. Moreover, CSF1R could promote RA-FLS 
proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and accelerate the cell cycle. The targeting 
relationship between imatinib and CSF1R was also validated in this study. 
Imatinib attenuated RA-FLS inflammation in a concentration-dependent manner. 
Meanwhile, imatinib could inhibit RA-FLS proliferation and promote apoptosis, 
ultimately reducing the damage of RA-FLS. Over-expression of CSF1R accelerated 
the cell cycle and proliferation of RA-FLS, while inhibiting cell apoptosis. 
Conversely, imatinib could significantly restrain the cell cycle and viability 
of RA-FLS and accelerated apoptosis via suppression of CSF1R expression. 
Further, histological and serological assay investigated and proved the 
proinflammatory effects of CSF1R in RA rabbits.

CONTEXT: We investigated whether 6 weeks of high-intensity interval training 
(HIT) induced improvements in cardiometabolic health markers similar to 
moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in people with type 1 diabetes 
(T1D), and whether HIT abolished acute reductions in plasma glucose levels 
observed after MICT sessions.
METHODS: Two groups of sedentary individuals with T1D (n = 7 per group) 
completed 6 weeks of thrice weekly HIT or MICT. Pre- and post-training 
measurements were made of 24-hour interstitial glucose profiles, using 
continuous glucose monitors, and cardiometabolic health markers [peak oxygen 
consumption (V˙o2peak), blood lipid profile, and aortic pulse wave velocity 
(aPWV)]. Capillary blood glucose (BG) concentrations were assessed before and 
after exercise to investigate changes in BG levels during exercise in the fed 
state.
RESULTS: Six weeks of HIT or MICT increased V˙o2peak by 14% and 15%, 
respectively (P < 0.001), and aPWV by 12% (P < 0.001), with no difference 
between groups. There was no difference in incidence or percentage of time spent 
in hypoglycemia after training in either group (P > 0.05). In the fed state, the 
mean change (±SEM) in capillary BG concentration during the HIT sessions was 
-0.2 ± 0.5 mmol/L, and -5.5 ± 0.4 mmol/L during MICT.
CONCLUSIONS: Six weeks of HIT improved V˙o2peak and aPWV to a similar extent as 
MICT. That BG levels remained stable during HIT in the fed state but 
consistently fell during MICT suggests HIT may be the preferred training mode 
for some people with T1D.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of total glucosides of peony (TGP) in adults 
with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). A multi-center, randomized, 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted between March 2012 and 
July 2014 at ten Chinese hospitals. In total, 320 pSS patients-classified 
according to the 2002 American-European Consensus Group Criteria-were randomized 
(2:1 ratio) to receive TGP(600 mg, tid) in the TGP group or placebo for 24 weeks 
in the placebo group. Study personnel, investigators, and patients were blinded 
to the treatment grouping. The primary endpoint was the improvement of EULAR 
Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) at week 24. The secondary 
endpoints were dry eyes/mouth/skin/nose/throat/vagina visual analogue scale 
(VAS), pain and discomfort VAS, fatigue VAS, mental discomfort VAS, patient 
global assessment (PGA), EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index 
(ESSDAI), Schirmer's test, basal/stimulated salivary flow-rate values, and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). All adverse events were recorded during 
the trial period. ESSPRI improved more in the TGP than the placebo group 
(p < 0.001). Dry eyes/throat/vagina VAS, fatigue VAS, mental discomfort VAS, 
PGA, Schirmer's test, and ESR also improved more in the TGP group than in the 
placebo group (all p < 0.05). Stimulated salivary flow-rate values increased in 
the TGP group at week 12 but not at week 24. Adverse events in TGP group were 
10.9%. TGP can alleviate some dryness symptoms as well as disease activity in 
pSS patients over 24 weeks. TGP was well tolerated by study subjects. TGP seems 
to be an effective and safe treatment for pSS.

Macrophages play a key role in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Notably, positive correlations have been reported between synovial macrophage 
infiltration and disease activity as well as therapy outcome in RA patients. 
Hence, macrophages can serve as an important target for both imaging disease 
activity and drug delivery in RA. Folate receptor β (FRβ) is a 
glycosylphosphatidyl (GPI)-anchored plasma membrane protein being expressed on 
myeloid cells and activated macrophages. FRβ harbors a nanomolar binding 
affinity for folic acid allowing this receptor to be exploited for RA disease 
imaging (e.g., folate-conjugated PET tracers) and therapeutic targeting (e.g., 
folate antagonists and folate-conjugated drugs). This review provides an 
overview of these emerging applications in RA by summarizing and discussing 
properties of FRβ, expression of FRβ in relation to macrophage polarization, 
FRβ-targeted in vivo imaging modalities, and FRβ-directed drug targeting.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are characterized by joint and 
systemic high- or low-grade inflammation, respectively. Adipose tissue (AT) may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. To address this issue, we 
investigated whether basal and pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β)-triggered 
release of adipocytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1Ra, TGFβ, CCL2/MCP-1, 
CCL5/RANTES, MMP-3) from subcutaneous (ScAT) and intraarticular (AAT) adipose 
tissues of RA and OA patients mirror differences between these diseases in an 
intensity of systemic and local inflammation. We found that in both diseases 
basal adipocytokine release was usually higher from AAT than ScAT, reflecting 
stronger local than systemic inflammation. However, ScAT secreted considerable 
amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors as well. Spontaneous secretion of 
some adipocytokines (MMP-3 and/or TNF, CCL2/MCP-1, IL-1Ra) was higher in 
osteoarthritis than rheumatoid ATs and probably caused by weaker 
anti-inflammatory treatment of OA patients. By contrast, reactivity of ATs to 
IL-1β was significantly lower in OA than RA and IL-1β antagonist (IL-1Ra) could 
be responsible for this because we found its overproduction in OA ATs. 
Interestingly, higher reactivity of ScAT than AAT to IL-1β was a characteristic 
for OA while reactivity of rheumatoid ScAT and AAT to this stimulus was equal. 
We conclude that differences between OA and RA in reactivity of AAT and ScAT to 
pro-inflammatory stimulus mimicking in vivo condition reflect dissimilarity in 
an intensity of disease-specific inflammation and thus support contribution of 
ATs to these pathological processes. Moreover, we propose that more efficient 
anti-inflammatory mechanism(s) are preserved in ATs of OA than RA patients.

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is a type of 
immune-mediated encephalitis, which is a new category of treatment-responsive 
paraneoplastic encephalitis. In patients with this disease, 
electroencephalography (EEG) shows non-specific findings, but recently, a unique 
EEG pattern, named the extreme delta brush, was detected in 40% of adult 
patients and was suggested to be specific to this type of encephalitis. Here, we 
describe a two-year-old boy with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, who presented with 
speech arrest and disturbances of gait and cognition several weeks after 
developing febrile convulsions. In the early stages of the disease, EEG showed 
14-16 Hz, continuous, fast waves characterized by a high amplitude 
(200-500 ÂµV), very diffuse spreading, and a sharp morphology, during light 
sleep only, which was compatible with extreme spindles. As the patient's 
symptoms worsened, this finding was replaced by rhythmic, diffuse, high-voltage, 
slow waves. Immediately after immunomodulatory therapies, including intravenous 
methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, his clinical manifestations and EEG 
abnormalities appeared to improve. We propose that although the extreme spindle 
is a non-specific finding of this type of encephalitis, early EEG monitoring 
might be necessary to detect not only the extreme delta brush pattern, but also 
non-specific findings, including extreme spindles, which would aid early 
diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk of 
falls, with potential adverse outcomes. There is a considerable variation across 
studies regarding the prevalence of falls and its correlation with clinical 
data, disease-related outcomes and physical performance tests.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of falls and its 
association with clinical data, disease-related outcomes and physical 
performance tests.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 113 RA patients were divided into 3 
groups - "non-fallers", "sporadic fallers" and "recurrent fallers" - and 
compared in terms of clinical data, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), 
lower-limb tender and swollen joint count, disability (Health Assessment 
Questionnaire-Disability Index [HAQ-DI]), Foot Function Index (FFI), Berg 
Balance Scale (BBS), Timed-up-and-go Test (TUG) and 5-Time Sit Down-To-Stand Up 
Test (SST5). Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the 
associations between the studied variables and the occurrence of falls, 
estimating odds ratios (ORs). We also analyzed the correlation between disease 
outcome measures (HAQ-DI and CDAI) and physical tests (BBS, TUG, SST5).
RESULTS: Falls and fear of falling were reported by 59 (52.21%) and 71 (64.5%) 
patients, respectively. Significant associations were found between "recurrent 
fallers" and vertigo (OR=3.42; P=0.03), fear of falling (OR=3.44; P=0.01), low 
income (OR=2.02; P=0.04), CDAI (OR=1.08; P<0.01), HAQ-DI (OR=3.66; P<0.01), 
Lower-limb HAQ (OR=3.48; P<0.01), FFI-pain (OR=1.24; P=0.03), FFI-total 
(OR=1.23; P=0.04), lower-limb tender joint count (OR=1.22; P<0.01), BBS score 
(OR=1.14; P<0.01), TUG score (OR=1.13; P=0.03) and SST5 score (OR=1.06; P=0.02). 
On multivariate analysis, CDAI was the only significant predictor of recurrent 
falls (OR=1.08; P<0.01). Physical performance test scores (BBS, TUG, SST5) were 
correlated with the CDAI and HAQ-DI.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of falls in RA is high, most influenced by 
disease-related outcomes and linked to worse performance on physical tests (BBS, 
TUG and SST5).

OBJECTIVE: Recognition of a new type of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-specific 
autoantibody, the anti-carbamylated protein antibodies (anti-CarP), has provided 
an opportunity to improve the management and understanding of RA. The current 
study was undertaken to assess the relationship between anti-CarP antibodies and 
HLA-DRB1 alleles in RA.
METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 3 different collections, comprising a 
total of 1,126 RA patients. Serum reactivity against in vitro carbamylated fetal 
calf serum proteins was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
HLA-DRB1 alleles were determined using either hybridization techniques or 
imputation from HLA-dense genotypes. Results of these analyses were combined in 
a meta-analysis with data from 3 previously reported cohorts. The carrier 
frequencies of the common HLA-DRB1 alleles were compared between the 
antibody-positive RA subgroups and the double-negative subgroup of RA patients 
stratified by anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)/anti-CarP antibody 
status, and also between the 4 RA patient strata and healthy controls.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis was conducted with 3,709 RA patients and 2,305 healthy 
control subjects. Results revealed a significant increase in frequency of 
HLA-DRB1*03 carriers in the ACPA-/anti-CarP+ subgroup as compared to 
ACPA-/anti-CarP- RA patients and healthy controls; this was consistently found 
across the 6 sample collections. This association of HLA-DRB1*03 with 
ACPA-/anti-CarP+ RA was independent of the presence of the shared allele (SE) 
and any other confounders analyzed. No other allele was specifically associated 
with the ACPA-/anti-CarP+ RA patient subgroup. In contrast, frequency of the SE 
was significantly increased in the ACPA+/anti-CarP- and ACPA+/anti-CarP+ RA 
patient subgroups, without a significant distinction between them. Furthermore, 
some alleles (including HLA-DRB1*03) were associated with protection from ACPA+ 
RA.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a specific association of HLA-DRB1*03 with 
ACPA-/anti-CarP+ RA, suggesting that preferential presentation of carbamylated 
peptides could be a new mechanism underlying the contribution of HLA alleles to 
RA susceptibility.

OBJECTIVE: Adoptive Treg cell therapy has great potential to treat autoimmune 
disease. Currently, very little is known about how these cells impact inflamed 
tissues. This study was undertaken to elucidate how autologous Treg cell therapy 
influences tissue inflammation in human autoimmune disease.
METHODS: We describe a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient with active 
skin disease who received adoptive Treg therapy. We comprehensively quantified 
Treg cells and immune activation in peripheral blood and skin, with data 
obtained at multiple time points posttreatment.
RESULTS: Deuterium tracking of infused Treg cells revealed the transient 
presence of cells in peripheral blood, accompanied by increased percentages of 
highly activated Treg cells in diseased skin. Flow cytometric analysis and whole 
transcriptome RNA sequencing revealed that Treg cell accumulation in skin was 
associated with a marked attenuation of the interferon-γ pathway and a 
reciprocal augmentation of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) pathway. This phenomenon 
was more pronounced in skin relative to peripheral blood. To validate these 
findings, we investigated Treg cell adoptive transfer of skin inflammation in a 
murine model and found that it also resulted in a pronounced skewing away from 
Th1 immunity and toward IL-17 production.
CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a patient with SLE treated with 
autologous adoptive Treg cell therapy. Taken together, our results suggest that 
this treatment leads to increased activated Treg cells in inflamed skin, with a 
dynamic shift from Th1 to Th17 responses.

OBJECTIVE: Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are a hallmark of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Aside from autoantibody production, the function of 
autoantigen-specific B cells remains poorly understood in the context of this 
disease. This study set out to elucidate autoantigen-specific B cell functions 
through the isolation and immortalization of unique citrullinated 
protein/peptide (CP)-reactive B cell clones from RA patients.
METHODS: B cell clones from either the blood or synovial fluid of cyclic 
citrullinated peptide 2 (CCP2) antibody-positive RA patients were immortalized 
by genetic reprogramming with Bcl-6 and Bcl-xL. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay and flow cytometry were used to identify CCP2-reactive clones and to 
further characterize surface marker and cytokine expression as well as B cell 
receptor signaling competence. Global gene expression profiles were interrogated 
by RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Three unique CP-reactive memory B cell clones were generated from the 
blood or synovial fluid of 2 RA patients. CP-reactive memory B cells did not 
appear to be broadly cross-reactive, but rather had a fairly restricted epitope 
recognition profile. These clones were able to secrete both pro- and 
antiinflammatory cytokines and had a unique surface profile of costimulatory 
molecules and receptors, including CD40 and C5a receptor type 1, when compared 
to non-CP-reactive clones from the same patient. In addition, CP-reactive clones 
bound citrullinated protein, but not native protein, and could mobilize calcium 
in response to antigen binding.
CONCLUSION: CP-reactive memory B cells comprise a rare, seemingly oligoclonal 
population with restricted epitope specificity and distinct phenotypic and 
molecular characteristics suggestive of antigen-presenting cells. Cloning by 
genetic reprogramming opens new avenues to study the function of autoreactive 
memory B cells, especially in terms of antigen processing, presentation, and 
subsequent T cell polarization.

Autoimmune diseases are a broad range of diseases in which the immune system 
produces an inappropriate response to self-antigens. This results in 
inflammation, damage, or dysfunction of tissues and/or organs. Many autoimmune 
diseases are more common in women and differences between female and male immune 
and autoimmune responses have been well documented. In general, most of the 
autoimmune diseases seem to affect more females, although there are exceptions. 
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are considered to be autoimmune liver diseases 
(AILD). They all are rare diseases and they result in significant morbidity and 
mortality. The female predominance in PBC and AIH are among the strongest among 
autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanisms responsible for the sex differences 
in autoimmune liver diseases are largely unknown. In this review, we discuss the 
recent findings on the influence of sex-dependent mechanisms, which may 
contribute to differences in presentation, clinical characteristics, disease 
course, and complications observed between female and male patients with 
autoimmune liver disease.

Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the 
resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the 
susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 
In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. 
Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous 
lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes 
SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted 
TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic 
cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes 
single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each 
cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage 
with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome 
inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been 
hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female 
immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. 
We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent 
evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, 
monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B 
cells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven 
functional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the 
enhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent 
autoimmune syndromes.

OBJECTIVE: In nondiabetic healthy individuals, insulin secretion and sensitivity 
are linked by a negative feedback loop characterized by a hyperbolic function. 
We aimed to study the association of traditional insulin resistance (IR) factors 
with insulin secretion and sensitivity, and to determine whether the hyperbolic 
equilibrium of this relation is preserved in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study encompassing 361 nondiabetic 
individuals: 151 with RA and 210 controls. Insulin, C-peptide, and IR indices by 
homeostatic model (HOMA2) were assessed. A multivariable analysis was performed 
to evaluate the differences in the correlation of traditional IR-related factors 
with glucose homeostasis molecules, as well as IR indices between patients and 
controls. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to assess the hyperbolic 
relation of insulin sensitivity and secretion.
RESULTS: HOMA2-IR indices were higher in patients with RA than controls. Hepatic 
insulin extraction, as assessed by the insulin:C-peptide molar ratio, was lower 
in patients with RA after multivariable analysis (0.08 ± 0.02 vs 0.14 ± 0.07, p 
< 0.001). Traditional IR-related factors showed significantly lower adjusted 
correlation coefficients with IR indices in patients with RA. The association 
between insulin sensitivity and secretion showed a different hyperbolic relation 
in patients with RA: the variability explained by the curve was lower in RA 
(nonlinear r2 = 0.845 vs r2 = 0.928, p = 0.001) and β coefficients (-0.74, 95% 
CI -0.77 to -0.70 vs -1.09, 95% CI -1.17 to -1.02, ng/ml, p < 0.001) were 
different in RA.
CONCLUSION: The traditional factors associated with IR in healthy individuals 
are less related to IR in patients with RA. Insulin sensitivity and secretion 
yield a different hyperbolic equilibrium in RA.

OBJECTIVE: To revise the current juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification 
criteria with an evidence-based approach, using clinical and routine laboratory 
measures available worldwide, to identify homogeneous clinical groups and to 
distinguish those forms of chronic arthritis typically seen only in children 
from the childhood counterpart of adult diseases.
METHODS: The overall project consists of 4 steps. This work represents Step 1, a 
Delphi Web-based consensus and Step 2, an international nominal group technique 
(NGT) consensus conference for the new provisional Pediatric Rheumatology 
International Trials Organization JIA classification criteria. A future large 
data collection of at least 1000 new-onset JIA patients (Step 3) followed by 
analysis and NGT consensus (Step 4) will provide data for the evidence-based 
validation of the JIA classification criteria.
RESULTS: In Step 1, three Delphi rounds of interactions were implemented to 
revise the 7 ILAR JIA categories. In Step 2, forty-seven questions with 
electronic voting were implemented to derive the new proposed criteria. Four 
disorders were proposed: (a) systemic JIA; (b) rheumatoid factor-positive JIA; 
(c) enthesitis/spondylitis-related JIA; and (d) early-onset antinuclear 
antibody-positive JIA. The other forms were gathered under the term "others." 
These will be analyzed during the prospective data collection using a list of 
descriptors to see whether the clustering of some of them could identify 
homogeneous entities.
CONCLUSION: An international consensus was reached to identify different 
proposed homogeneous chronic disorders that fall under the historical term JIA. 
These preliminary criteria will be formally validated with a dedicated project.

OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular (CV) risk estimation calculators for the general 
population do not perform well in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An 
RA-specific risk calculator has been developed, but did not perform better than 
a risk calculator for the general population when validated in a heterogeneous 
multinational cohort.
METHODS: In a cohort of patients with new-onset RA from northern Sweden (n = 
665), the risk of CV disease was estimated by the Expanded Cardiovascular Risk 
Prediction Score for Rheumatoid Arthritis (ERS-RA) and the American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association algorithm (ACC/AHA). The ACC/AHA 
estimation was analyzed, both as crude data and when adjusted according to the 
recommendations by the European League Against Rheumatism (ACC/AHA × 1.5). 
ERS-RA was calculated using 2 variants: 1 from patient and physician reports of 
hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia [ERS-RA (reported)] and 1 from assessments 
of blood pressure (BP) and blood lipids [ERS-RA (measured)]. The estimations 
were compared with observed CV events.
RESULTS: All variants of risk calculators underestimated the CV risk. 
Discrimination was good for all risk calculators studied. Performance of all 
risk calculators was poorer in patients with a high grade of inflammation, 
whereas ACC/AHA × 1.5 performed best in the high-inflammatory patients. In those 
patients with an estimated risk of 5-15%, no risk calculator performed well.
CONCLUSION: ERS-RA underestimated the risk of a CV event in our cohort of 
patients, especially when risk estimations were based on patient or physician 
reports of HTN and hyperlipidemia instead of assessment of BP and blood lipids. 
The performance of ERS-RA was no better than that of ACC/AHA × 1.5, and neither 
performed well in high-inflammatory patients.

The IL-1 cytokines are considered among the first family of cytokines that 
orchestrate acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Both IL-1β and IL-1α are 
members of the IL-1 family; however, their distinct roles in the inflammatory 
processes remain poorly understood. We explored the role of IL-1α in 
IL-1β-activated signaling pathways causing synovial inflammation in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Using synovial fibroblasts isolated from RA joints, we found 
that IL-1β significantly stimulated IL-1α expression, which was selectively 
inhibited by blocking the NF-κB pathway. Knockdown of IL-1α using small 
interfering RNA abolished IL-1β-induced pro-IL-1α and pro-IL-1β expression and 
suppressed inflammation. Native and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed 
that IL-1α cooperates in NF-κBp65 binding to the distal region of IL-1α promoter 
and to the proximal region of IL-1β promoter upstream of the transcription start 
site to stabilize their gene transcription. Molecular dynamics simulation of 
IL-1α or IL-1β binding to IL-1 receptor showed distinct interaction sites that 
corroborate with the ability of IL-1α to differentially activate phosphorylation 
of signaling proteins compared with IL-1β. Our study highlights the importance 
of IL-1α in mediating IL-1β-induced inflammation in addition to maintaining its 
expression and providing a rationale for targeting IL-1α to minimize the role of 
IL-1β in inflammatory diseases like RA.-Singh, A. K., Fechtner, S., Chourasia, 
M., Sicalo, J., Ahmed, S. Critical role of IL-1α in IL-1β-induced inflammatory 
responses: cooperation with NF-κBp65 in transcriptional regulation.

OBJECTIVES: To describe a cohort of Finnish juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
patients, to recognize those young adults who are at risk of becoming socially 
restricted by their long-term rheumatic disease, and to assess which areas of 
self-rated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are associated with the 
emergence of restricted social participation.
METHODS: A total of 195 young adults with JIA completed questionnaires 
addressing demographics, health behaviour, physical activity, functional 
ability, HRQoL, depressive symptoms, and self-esteem. Patients were classified 
as having non-restricted social participation if they were engaged in studying, 
working, maternity leave, or military service, and restricted social 
participation if they were unemployed or on disability pension.
RESULTS: Of the patients, 162 (83%) were considered as having non-restricted 
social participation and 33 (16%) restricted social participation. Among 
patients with restricted social participation, five (15%) were on disability 
pension and 28 (85%) were unemployed. Patients with restricted social 
participation participated less in leisure-time non-physical activities 
(p = 0.033), felt more disturbed during their leisure time (p = 0.010), had 
lower self-esteem (p = 0.005), and had higher disability scores (p = 0.024). 
HRQoL scores revealed statistically significant differences between the groups: 
physical functioning (p = 0.043), social functioning (p = 0.016), and emotional 
well-being (p = 0.049) were all lower in patients with restricted social 
participation.
CONCLUSIONS: Socially restricted patients showed a higher degree of disability, 
and lower levels of physical functioning, self-esteem, emotional well-being, and 
social functioning. These patients should be recognized earlier and 
interventions provided to enhance their social participation.

OBJECTIVE: Small airway disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are 
common in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). However, the underlying inflammatory 
mechanisms behind pSS-associated airway disease have not been studied in detail. 
We therefore wanted to study cytokine and leucocyte levels in induced sputum in 
never-smoking patients with pSS.
METHOD: Induced sputum cytokines and leucocytes were assessed in 20 
never-smoking patients with pSS and 19 age- and gender-matched population-based 
controls. In addition, pulmonary function, disease activity, respiratory 
symptoms, and inflammatory and serological features of pSS were assessed.
RESULTS: B-cell activating factor (BAFF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were 
significantly increased in induced sputum in pSS patients compared to 
population-based controls, while IL-1β, interferon-α, and tumour necrosis 
factor-α levels and leucocytes were not. The proportion of lymphocytes and BAFF 
levels in induced sputum correlated significantly in pSS patients. However, 
cytokine levels in induced sputum were not associated with pulmonary function 
tests, disease activity, respiratory symptoms, or serological features of pSS.
CONCLUSION: The increase in BAFF, IL-6, and IL-8 in induced sputum suggests a 
specific ongoing inflammatory disease process in the airways in pSS patients. 
Its association with pSS-associated airway disease needs to be further examined 
in future larger studies.

OBJECTIVE: The presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) in 
primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) ranges from 3% to 9.9%; however, there is no 
agreement about their clinical significance. Our aim was to systematically 
review the literature regarding the association of arthritis and ACPAs in pSS 
and their role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHOD: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane 
Library from inception until June 2016 was undertaken using the combination of 
two or three of the keywords: primary Sjögren's syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, 
arthritis, synovitis, arthropathy, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, 
and anti-citrullinated protein antibody - ACPA. No language restriction was 
used. Studies were included if they: assessed the association of arthritis and 
ACPAs, had sufficient data to construct a two-by-two table, tested 
immunoglobulin G ACPA by any method, and included patients with pSS according to 
a validated set of classification criteria. We used a random effects model and 
evaluated the heterogeneity and publication bias.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included (involving 1322 patients). We found a pooled 
odds ratio of 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.15-16.94, p = 0.03). The test for 
heterogeneity was I2 = 0.87. Publication bias was not observed. Based on data 
from three studies, 33 of 58 pSS patients with ACPAs (57%) developed RA compared 
with none of 598 pSS patients with negative ACPA (p < 0.000001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with pSS disclosing ACPAs are prone to arthritis as part of 
the clinical spectrum of the disease, but are also at risk of developing RA.

BACKGROUND: Published reports evaluating whether angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) therapy could bring 
improvements to the prognosis of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) have 
yielded confusing results, which entails a systematic review of those reports. 
In this study, we summarized currently available evidence from randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of ACEI/ARB therapy of IgAN.
METHODS: PubMed, International comprehensive biomedical information 
bibliographic database produced by the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE), 
Excerpt Medica Database (EMBASE), and Cochrane Library and article reference 
lists were searched for RCTs that compared ACEI/ARB with placebo and any other 
nonimmunosuppressive agents except RAAS agents for treating IgAN. The quality of 
the studies was evaluated with the performance of explicit eligibility criteria 
and the revised Jadad scale. Meta-analyses were completed on the outcomes of 
proteinuria, serum creatinine (SCr), blood pressure and glomerular filtration 
rate (GFR) in patients with IgAN.
RESULTS: Five RCTs involving 295 patients were included in this review. ACEI/ARB 
agents had statistically significant effects on reduction proteinuria 
(standardized mean differences [SMD], -0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.64 
to -0.27; P < 0.00001; heterogeneity I 2  = 35%; P = 0.20) and blood pressure, 
but no significant difference was found on SCr (SMD, -3.51; 95% CI, -16.55 to 
9.54; P = 0.60; heterogeneity I 2  = 0%; P = 0.74) and GFR (SMD, 2.59; 95% CI, 
-7.14 to 12.33; P = 0.60; heterogeneity I 2  = 57%; P = 0.10).
CONCLUSION: ACEI/ARB agents had statistically significant effects on reducing 
proteinuria. As proteinuria is a major pathology of IgAN, which was 
significantly improved by ACEI/ARB, we proposed that ACEI/ARB agents were a 
promising therapy. Because the studies under review did not perform blind 
method, used a variety of doses and types of ACEI/ARB agents and lacked 
follow-up to evaluate the long-term effect of the agents on IgAN patients.

OBJECTIVE: Serum interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels are increased in patients with 
interstitial lung disease (ILD). In addition, IL-18 levels are increased in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and are associated with arthritis 
activity. We determined whether increased IL-18 levels are associated with ILD 
in RA.
METHOD: RA patients were enrolled using an RA cohort database. Plasma IL-18 
levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ILD was determined by 
a pulmonologist and a radiologist based on chest radiography and computed 
tomography findings. IL-18 levels for RA with ILD and RA without ILD were 
compared. Associations between ILD and various markers including IL-18 and 
confounding factors (e.g. smoking history) were investigated by logistic 
regression analysis. Diagnostic values of IL-18 for the presence of ILD were 
investigated using receiver operating characteristics curve analysis.
RESULTS: ILD was complicated in 8.2% (n = 26) of the study population (N = 312). 
Plasma IL-18 levels were higher for RA patients with ILD than for RA patients 
without ILD (721.0 ± 481.4 vs 436.8 ± 438.9 pg/mL, p < 0.001). IL-18, Krebs von 
den Lungen-6, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody titre and 
glucocorticoid doses were independently associated with the presence of ILD 
during multivariate logistic regression analysis. Sensitivity and specificity of 
IL-18 levels for the detection of ILD in RA patients were 65.3% and 76.3%, 
respectively (area under the curve = 0.73).
CONCLUSION: Plasma IL-18 levels were higher for RA patients with ILD than for 
those without ILD. Increased IL-18 levels were associated with the presence of 
ILD.

OBJECTIVE: Peptidylarginine deiminase-4 (PAD4) is highly expressed by 
neutrophils and essential for citrullination occurring during the formation of 
neutrophil extracellular traps, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis 
of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PADI4 influence PAD4 expression and 
functionality. Here, we investigate whether SNPs in PADI4 influence the risk of 
SLE or LN.
METHOD: Altogether, 234 SLE patients and 484 controls were genotyped for nine 
PADI4 SNPs known to alter PAD4 functionality and/or expression, or to be 
associated with other autoimmune diseases, using an in-house multiplex Luminex 
assay. All analyses were adjusted for age and gender.
RESULTS: Heterozygosity for rs1748033, and heterozygosity and homozygosity for 
rs1635564, were associated with increased occurrence of SLE [odds ratio (OR) 
1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.23; OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06-2.19; and OR 
2.06, 95% CI 1.08-3.93, respectively]. Homozygosity for rs1635564 was also 
associated with increased occurrence of LN (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.2-10.97). Notably, 
gene dose effects of the rs1635564 variant allele were observed for SLE 
(p = 0.005) and LN (p = 0.01). Carriage of minor alleles of five other SNPs 
(rs11203366, rs11203367, rs874881, rs2240340, and rs11203368) was associated 
with increased occurrence of LN and hypertension.
CONCLUSION: The rs1635564 polymorphism of PADI4 is a candidate risk factor for 
SLE, particularly with renal involvement. Additional PADI4 polymorphisms also 
conferred increased risk of LN. Overall, these findings support the notion of 
PAD4 contributing to the pathogenesis of SLE and LN.

Flavonoids are natural polyphenolic compounds which are included in a panoply of 
drugs and used to treat and/or manage human ailments such as metabolic, 
cardiovascular, neurological disorders and cancer. Thus, the purpose of this 
review is to emphasize the importance of flavonoids for the treatment of 
autoimmune diseases and put into the limelight of the scientific community 
several health-promoting effects of flavonoids which could be beneficial for the 
development of novel drugs from natural products. Despite available reviews on 
flavonoids targeting various disease conditions, a comprehensive review of 
flavonoids for autoimmune diseases is still lacking. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first attempt to review the potential of flavonoids for 
autoimmune diseases. The structure-activity relationship of flavonoids in this 
review revealed that the rearrangement and introduction of other functional 
groups into the basic skeleton of flavonoids might lead to the development of 
new drugs which will be helpful in relieving the painful symptoms of various 
autoimmune diseases.

AIMS: To understand the opinions of children with type 1 diabetes about their 
everyday use of flash glucose monitoring. (FGM).
METHODS: Children with type 1 diabetes using the FreeStyle Libre® FGM system 
and/or their parents were surveyed in several French medical centers between 
December 2016 and June 2017, regardless of their treatment regimen and metabolic 
control.
RESULTS: Of the 347 patients recruited, 79.5% had been using the sensor for more 
than three months (average usage time: 285 days). The main reported motivations 
for initiating this type of monitoring were to avoid finger prick pain (for 
85.9% of patients) and to allow parents to check nocturnal glucose levels 
(60.8%). Two-thirds of respondents experienced difficulties, mainly the sensor 
falling off (47.6%), measurement discrepancies (25.1%) and cutaneous reactions 
(22.2%); 89.5% changed their habits: 70.6% took more scans, 37.2% corrected 
their hyperglycemia more promptly, and 37.5% used trends to adjust their insulin 
dosage. About one-third of the study group (35.1%) experienced lower HbA1c 
levels, and two thirds (67.1%) were satisfied with the device.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FGM is a widely accepted option for 
self-monitoring diabetes, but that specific training is required to improve its 
use for insulin dosage adjustment and metabolic results.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) in patients 
with inflammatory joint diseases (IJD) could be challenging. Several tests used 
for diagnosing PJI may be inaccurate due to baseline inflammatory 
characteristics of such diseases. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of several 
infection biomarkers, in a specific subgroup of patients with PJI and IJD.
METHODS: From January 2014 to August 2017, patients with resisting pain at the 
relevant site, following total knee arthroplasty were evaluated prospectively. A 
total of 38 patients were undergone revision arthroplasty. Patients were 
categorized in terms of MSIS criteria: Patients with PJI (Group 1, n = 17) and 
patients without PJI (Group 2, n = 21). Serum ESR, CRP, Procalcitonin, synovial 
cell count, percentage of neutrophils in synovial fluid, synovial CRP, 
Lactoferrin, ELA-2, Thiol - Disulphide levels, BPI and the Alpha defensin test 
results were obtained. The results of two groups were compared and the 
diagnostic accuracy of each variable was evaluated.
RESULTS: There were 22 women, 16 men with a mean age of 67.8 ± 6.9 years. The 
differences were significant in all evaluated biomarkers in terms of PJI (p 
values of all biomarker were <0.001). Alpha defensin, Lactoferrin, ELA-2, BPI, 
Procalcitonin and synovial CRP were the most accurate tests with area under 
curve >0.90.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that IJD may not affect the accuracy of 
infection biomarkers in patients with PJI. Alpha defensin test, Lactoferrin, 
ELA-2, BPI, Procalcitonin and synovial CRP can be used in the diagnosis of PJI 
in patients with IJD.

The Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data linked with genomic data have 
facilitated efficient and large scale translational studies. One major challenge 
in using EMR for translational research is the difficulty in accurately and 
efficiently annotating disease phenotypes due to the low accuracy of billing 
codes and the time involved with manual chart review. Recent efforts such as 
those by the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network and 
Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) have led to an 
increasing number of algorithms available for classifying various disease 
phenotypes. Investigators can apply such algorithms to obtain predicted 
phenotypes for their specific EMR study. They typically perform a small 
validation study within their cohort to assess the algorithm performance and 
then subsequently treat the algorithm classification as the true phenotype for 
downstream genetic association analyses. Despite the superior performance 
compared to simple billing codes, these algorithms may not port well across 
institutions, leading to bias and low power for association studies. In this 
paper, we propose a semi-supervised method to make inferences about both the 
accuracy of multiple available algorithms and the effect of genetic markers on 
the true phenotype, leveraging information from both a large set of unlabeled 
data where both genetic markers and algorithm output information and a small 
validation data where labels are additionally available. The simulation studies 
show that the proposed method substantially outperforms existing methods from 
the missing data literature. The proposed methods are applied to an EMR study of 
how low density lipoprotein risk alleles affect the risk of cardiovascular 
disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically assess the 
association of insulin-manipulation (intentional under- and/or overdosing of 
insulin), psychiatric comorbidity and diabetes complications.
METHODS: Two diagnostic interviews (Diabetes-Self-Management-Patient-Interview 
and Children's-Diagnostic-Interview for Psychiatric Disorders) were conducted 
with 241 patients (age 10-22) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from 21 randomly 
selected Austrian diabetes care centers. Medical data was derived from medical 
records.
RESULTS: Psychiatric comorbidity was found in nearly half of the patients with 
insulin-manipulation (46.3%) compared to a rate of 17.5% in patients, adherent 
to the prescribed insulin therapy. Depression (18.3% vs 4.9%), specific phobia 
(21.1% vs 2.9%), social phobia (7.0% vs 0%), and eating disorders (12.7% vs 
1.9%) were elevated in patients with insulin-manipulation. Females (37.7%) were 
more often diagnosed (P = 0.001) with psychiatric disorders than males (18.4%). 
In females, the percentage of psychiatric comorbidity significantly increased 
with the level of non-adherence to insulin therapy. Insulin-manipulation had an 
effect of +0.89% in HbA1c (P = <0.001) compared to patients adherent to insulin 
therapy, while there was no association of psychiatric comorbidity with 
metabolic control (HbA1c 8.16% vs 8.12% [65.68 vs 65.25 mmol/mol]). 
Ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia, and frequency of outpatient visits in a 
diabetes center were highest in patients with insulin-manipulation.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study using a systematic approach to assess the 
prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients who do or do not manipulate 
insulin in terms of intentional under- and/or overdosing. Internalizing 
psychiatric disorders were associated with insulin-manipulation, especially in 
female patients and insulin-manipulation was associated with deteriorated 
metabolic control and diabetes complications.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most prevalent chronic rheumatic 
disease in children and young people (CYP) and a major cause of pain and 
disability. The vast majority of the world's children and their families live in 
less resourced countries (LRCs) and face significant socioeconomic and 
healthcare challenges. Current recommendations for standards of care and 
treatment for children with JIA do not consider children living in less 
resourced countries. In order to develop appropriate recommendations for the 
care of CYP with JIA in less resourced countries a meeting of experienced 
pediatric rheumatologists from less resourced countries was convened with 
additional input from a steering group of international pediatric 
rheumatologists with experience in developing recommendations and standards of 
care for JIA. Following a needs assessment survey of healthcare workers caring 
for CYP with JIA in LRC, a literature review was carried out and management 
recommendations formulated using Delphi technique and a final consensus 
conference. Responses from the needs assessment were received from 121/483 (25%) 
practitioners from 25/49 (51%) less resourced countries. From these responses, 
the initial 84 recommendations were refined and expanded through a series of 3 
online Delphi rounds. A final list of 90 recommendations was proposed for 
evaluation. Evidence for each statement was reviewed, graded, and presented to 
the consensus group. The degree of consensus, level of agreement, and level of 
evidence for these recommendations are reported. Recommendations arrived at by 
consensus for CYP with JIA in less resourced countries cover 5 themes: (1) 
diagnosis, (2) referral and monitoring, (3) education and training, (4) advocacy 
and networks, and (5) research. Thirty-five statements were drafted. All but one 
statement achieved 100% consensus. The body of published evidence was small and 
the quality of evidence available for critical appraisal was low. Our 
recommendations offer novel insights and present consensus-based strategies for 
the management of JIA in less resourced countries. The emphasis on communicable 
and endemic diseases influencing the diagnosis and treatment of JIA serves as a 
valuable addition to existing JIA guidelines. With increasing globalization, 
these recommendations as a whole provide educational and clinical utility for 
clinicians worldwide. The low evidence base for our recommendations reflects a 
shortage of research specific to less resourced countries and serves as an 
impetus for further inquiry towards optimizing care for children with JIA around 
the world.

Libman-Sacks (LS) endocarditis is rarely seen in the prenatal and puerperal 
periods and is generally reported as a cardiac manifestation of systemic lupus 
erythematosus. In this report, we present a rare case of congestive heart 
failure after vaginal delivery. The patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus 
erythematosus and LS endocarditis based on the transesophageal echocardiographic 
and laboratory findings. After steroid therapy, the vegetations on the mitral 
valve disappeared and mitral regurgitation reduced dramatically without a 
cardiac surgery. The patient achieved long-term clinical improvement at 3-year 
follow-up. Immunosuppressive therapy could be an effective treatment for acute 
congestive heart failure induced by LS endocarditis.

OBJECTIVE: We have comprehensively evaluated an immunologic response to food 
antigens, mediated by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, on clinical aspects of 
Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT).
METHODS: IgG antibodies to 125 food antigens were measured in serum samples of 
74 HT patients and 245 controls using microarray-based enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. We analyzed differences in IgG levels between 
two groups and evaluated correlations between food-specific IgG levels and 
HT-related clinical phenotypes (thyroid hormones/antibodies, symptoms of 
hypothyroidism, measures of body size and blood pressure) and food consumption 
in HT patients.
RESULTS: We observed increased IgG levels to 12 different food antigens in 
either HT cases or controls, of which plum-specific IgG antibodies were 
significantly higher (p = 1.70 × 10-8), and almond-specific IgG antibodies were 
significantly lower (p = 8.11 × 10-5) in HT patients in comparison to controls, 
suggesting their possible roles in HT etiology or symptomatology. There was no 
significant correlation between any of 12 increased food-specific IgG 
antibodies, along with gluten-specific IgG, with clinically important 
phenotypes, such as thyroid hormones/antibodies or symptoms. Among other tested 
correlations, the most interesting is the negative correlation between coffee 
and tea combined IgG levels and number of symptoms, suggesting possible 
beneficial effect of tea and coffee on disease symptoms. We also found that food 
consumption is not correlated with IgG levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of food-specific IgG antibodies is comparable between 
HT patients and controls, with the exception of plum and almond. There is no 
evidence that increased food-specific IgG antibodies are associated with 
clinical aspects of HT. Clarification of biology behind formation of these 
antibodies is needed.

OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence and clinical associations of clinical and 
imaging definitions of synovitis in unselected SLE patients with musculoskeletal 
(MSK) symptoms.
METHODS: 112 patients with SLE (excluding RF and CCP positive patients); 88 
consecutive with inflammatory MSK symptoms and 24 asymptomatic SLE controls were 
recruited. Patients had clinical assessment (BILAG, SLEDAI, joint counts, 
patient and physician visual analogue score), routine laboratory tests and US of 
two hands and wrists (synovitis and tenosynovitis, OMERACT definitions).
RESULTS: Overall, 68% (60/88) of symptomatic patients had US inflammation (grey 
scale ⩾ 2 and/or PD ⩾ 1 or tenosynovitis) compared with 17% (4/23) of 
asymptomatic patients. In symptomatic patients, clinical inflammation was seen 
defined by BILAG A or B in 38% (34/88) or defined by the SLEDAI-MSK criterion in 
32% (28/88). BILAG A/B had sensitivity (95% CI) of 56% (41, 69%) and specificity 
of 89% (72, 96%) for US-confirmed inflammation. SLEDAI-MSK criterion had 
sensitivity of 44% (31, 59%) and specificity of 89% (72, 96%). In patients with 
inflammatory symptoms, 27% (24/88) had subclinical inflammation (abnormal US but 
no clinically swollen joints) and 35% (31/88) had no clinical or US 
inflammation. Subclinical tenosynovitis and PD were associated with 
significantly higher IgG, physician visual analogue score, tender joint count.
CONCLUSION: In SLE patients with MSK symptoms, a large proportion of objective, 
clinically meaningful inflammation is only identifiable by US. The existing 
classification of MSK SLE using disease activity instruments based on joint 
swelling is inaccurate to guide patient selection for clinical trials, biologic 
therapy, or treat-to-target protocols.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials of the anti-interleukin-17A (anti-IL-17A) antibody 
secukinumab have demonstrated a crucial role of the cytokine IL-17A in the 
pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis (SpA); however, its cellular source in this 
condition remains a matter of controversy. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) 
have been recently identified as potent producers of proinflammatory cytokines, 
including IL-17A and IL-22, in a number of different tissues. This study was 
undertaken to characterize the presence and composition of ILCs, and investigate 
whether these cells are an important source of IL-17A, in the synovial tissue 
(ST) of patients with SpA.
METHODS: Matched ST, synovial fluid, and peripheral blood (PB) samples were 
obtained from SpA patients with actively inflamed knee joints. ILC subsets were 
characterized by flow cytometry. Gene expression analysis at the single-cell 
level was performed directly ex vivo and after in vitro activation. An IL-17A 
enzyme-linked immunospot assay was used to detect IL-17A-secreting cells.
RESULTS: ILCs, and particularly NKp44+ ILC3s, were expanded in inflamed 
arthritic joints. Single-cell expression analysis demonstrated that ST ILCs were 
clearly distinguishable from ST T cells and from their PB counterparts. 
Expression of the Th17 signature transcripts RORC, AHR, and IL23R was detected 
in a large proportion of ST ILC3s. These cells were capable of inducing 
expression of IL22 and CSF2, but not IL17A, in response to in vitro 
restimulation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that absolute and relative numbers of ILC3s 
are enriched in the synovial joints of patients with SpA. However, these cells 
are not a significant source of IL-17A in this disease.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are the common joints disorder 
in the world. Although they have showed the analogous clinical manifestation and 
overlapping cellular and molecular foundation, the pathogenesis of RA and OA 
were different. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of arthritis in RA and OA have 
not been investigated thoroughly. Thus, the aim of study is to identify the 
potential crucial genes and pathways associated with RA and OA and further 
analyze the molecular mechanisms implicated in genesis. First, we compared gene 
expression profiles in synovial tissue between RA and OA from the National 
Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database. Gene Expression Series (GSE) 1919, GSE55235, and GSE36700 were 
downloaded from the GEO database, including 20 patients of OA and 21 patients of 
RA. Diﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs) including "CXCL13," "CD247," "CCL5," 
"GZMB," "IGKC," "IL7R," "UBD///GABBR1," "ADAMDEC1," "BTC," "AIM2," "SHANK2," 
"CCL18," "LAMP3," "CR1," and "IL32." Second, Gene Ontology analyses revealed 
that DEGs were signiﬁcantly enriched in integral component of extracellular 
space, extracellular region, and plasma membrane in the molecular function 
group. Signaling pathway analyses indicated that DEGs had common pathways in 
chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and 
cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. Third, DEGs showed the complex DEGs 
protein-protein interaction network with the Coexpression of 83.22%, Shared 
protein domains of 8.40%, Colocalization of 4.76%, Predicted of 2.87%, and 
Genetic interactions of 0.75%. In conclusion, the novel DEGs and pathways 
between RA and OA identified in this study may provide new insight into the 
underlying molecular mechanisms of RA.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) presents important risk 
factors for cardiovascular events.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the components of the aortic pulse wave (APW) and the 
hemodynamic parameters among children and adolescents with DM1 and healthy 
individuals.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, with 36 children and adolescents 
diagnosed with DM1 (11.9 ± 3.2 years) matched by sex and age with the control 
group (n = 36, 12.4 ± 2.9 years). The components of the APW and the hemodynamic 
parameters were evaluated non-invasively, using Mobil-O-Graph.
RESULTS: On the week of the evaluation, DM1 patients presented glycated 
hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C [HbA1c]) of 9.48 ± 2.22% and fasting glycemia of 
222.58 ± 93.22 mg/dL. Augmentation index (AIx@75), reflection coefficient, and 
augmentation pressure (AP) were significantly higher in the DM1 group 
(29.0 ± 9.7%, 63.0 ± 7.9, and 7.8 ± 2.7 mm Hg, respectively) compared with the 
control group (20.6 ± 7.9%, 53.4 ± 9.1 and 4.9 ± 2.1 mm Hg, respectively). The 
systolic volume (52.6 ± 11.9 and 60 ± 12.4 mL) and the cardiac output (4.3 ± 0.5 
and 4.6 ± 0.5 L/min) decreased in the DM1 group in relation to the control 
group. The pulse pressure amplification (PPA) was significantly lower in the DM1 
group (1.4 ± 0.15) compared with the control group (1.6 ± 0.17). PPA correlated 
negatively with total vascular resistance (TVR), AP and reflection coefficient, 
and positively with cardiac index in both groups. In the DMI group, the AIx@75 
correlated negatively with age, height, systolic volume, and PPA, and correlated 
positively with the TVR and reflection coefficient.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the presence of arterial stiffness in this 
population and extend the knowledge, showing, for the first time, the reduction 
of PPA in the DM1 group.

Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder associated with chronic complications, 
is traditionally classified into two main subtypes. Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM) results from gradual pancreatic islet β cell autoimmune destruction, 
extending over months or years. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a 
heterogeneous disorder, with both insulin resistance and impairment in insulin 
secretion contributing to its pathogenesis. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin 
with an established role in calcium metabolism. Recently, several studies have 
provided evidence suggesting a role for it in various non-skeletal metabolic 
conditions, including both types of diabetes mellitus. Preclinical studies of 
vitamin D action on insulin secretion, insulin action, inflammatory processes, 
and immune regulation, along with evidence of an increase of hypovitaminosis D 
worldwide, have prompted several epidemiological, observational, and 
supplementation clinical studies investigating a potential biological 
interaction between hypovitaminosis D and diabetes. This narrative review aims 
to summarize current knowledge on the effect of vitamin D on T1DM and T2DM 
pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment, as well as on micro- and macrovascular 
complications of the disease. Furthermore, on the basis of current existing 
evidence, we aim to highlight areas for potential future research.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most common acquired pro-thrombotic 
disorder, also associated with obstetric complications. 
Phosphatidylserine/Prothrombin complex antibody (aPSPT) though associated with 
various APS manifestations, is not included in the revised Sapporo Criteria. To 
study the prevalence of aPSPT in Asian-Indian patients with suspected APS and 
compare its performance with the criteria anti-phospholipid antibodies (APLs). 
Electronic charts of 372 individuals whose sera was tested for aPSPT in 
suspected APS between June 2014 and May 2016 were retrieved and analyzed. aPSPT 
was assayed by ELISA. aPSPT tested individuals were categorized into 
cases-seropositive and seronegative APS (SNAPS) and controls. aPSPT was positive 
in 24/58 (41.3%) cases and 17/314 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.001). aPSPT positivity 
was seen in 44.5%, 38.7%, and 58.4% in primary, secondary and SNAPS patients 
respectively. aPSPT had the best performance among all APLs, in obstetric APS 
with 31% sensitivity, 97.7% specificity, and an odds ratio of 18.8. It showed 
41.4% sensitivity, 94.6% specificity for the classification/diagnosis of primary 
APS and 38.7% sensitivity, 91.5% specificity for secondary APS. Addition of 
aPSPT to current APS criteria to SNAPS patients led to reclassification of 
additional 12.1% patients as APS overall and 42.8% in obstetric APS category. In 
Asian-Indian patients with suspected APS, aPSPT outperformed all classical APLs 
in diagnosis/classification of obstetric APS and both isotypes of beta 
2-glycoprotein-I antibodies in diagnosis/classification of APS. aPSPT could 
reclassify additional 12.1 and 42.8% patients as APS overall and obstetric APS 
respectively, over and above the cases satisfying revised Sapporo criteria.

Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common primary glomerulonephritis 
worldwide, and it can be associated with liver disease. However, cases of 
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy secondary to Wilson's disease are very rare. A 
20-year-old Japanese man presented with microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and 
renal dysfunction. A renal biopsy showed mesangial cell proliferation, 
immunoglobulin A deposition, and electron-dense deposit in the mesangial areas, 
all of which are consistent with Immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Computed 
tomography of the abdomen showed liver atrophy and splenomegaly, and the 
diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed with decreased serum ceruloplasmin 
levels, increased urinary copper excretion, Kayser-Fleischer rings and copper 
deposition in the liver biopsy. The patient was treated successfully with 
trientine hydrochloride and zinc acetate and showed improvement in renal 
manifestations. Wilson's disease is a rare cause of secondary Immunoglobulin A 
nephropathy. We recommend that Wilson's disease should be considered the cause 
of secondary Immunoglobulin A nephropathy in juvenile patients with hematuria, 
proteinuria, and splenomegaly and suggest measuring the serum ceruloplasmin 
concentrations, urinary copper excretion, and evaluating Kayser-Fleischer rings 
in these patients.

OBJECTIVES: The generation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-related 
autoantibodies have been shown to be T cell dependent and antigen driven with 
HLA-DR restriction. In this study, the initiating antigen(s) and the mechanism 
of autoantibody diversification were investigated.
METHODS: T cell epitopes (T-epitopes) of SmD1 (SmD) were mapped by T-T 
hybridomas generated from DR3+AE0 mice immunised with SmD and with SmD 
overlapping peptides. TCRs from the reactive hybridomas were sequenced. The core 
epitopes were determined. Bacterial mimics were identified by bioinformatics. 
Sera from DR3+AE0 mice immunised with SmD peptides and their mimics were 
analysed for their reactivity by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Samples of 
blood donors were analysed for HLA-DR and autoantibody specificities.
RESULTS: Multiple HLA-DR3 restricted T-epitopes within SmD were identified. Many 
T-T hybridomas reacted with more than one epitope. Some of them were 
cross-reactive with other snRNP peptides and with proteins in the Ro60/La/Ro52 
complex. The reactive hybridomas used unique TCRs. Multiple T-epitope mimics 
were identified in commensal and environmental bacteria. Certain bacterial 
mimics shared both T and B cell epitopes with the related SmD peptide. Bacterial 
mimics induced autoantibodies to lupus-related antigens and to different 
tissues. HLA-DR3+ blood donors made significantly more SLE-related 
autoantibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: The unique antigenic structures of the lupus-related autoantigens 
provide the basis for being targeted and for T and B cell epitope spreading and 
autoantibody diversification with unique patterns. SLE-related autoantibodies 
are likely generated from responses to commensal and/or environmental microbes 
due to incomplete negative selection for autoreactive T cells. The production of 
SLE-related antibodies is inevitable in normal individuals. The findings in this 
investigation have significant implications in autoimmunity in general.

A previously healthy 35-year-old man suffering from behavioral and mental 
deterioration for three months was referred to our facility. On admission, the 
patient was dysphasic and had tonic-clonic seizures. Neurological examination 
showed mental confusion, euphoric mood, mania, paranoia, and mild motor 
dysphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed twice but no 
abnormalities were revealed. His acute confusional state, elevated cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) protein, epileptic seizure and electroencephalogram showing 
intermittent frontal slowness were all suggestive of encephalitis. The patient 
was treated with acyclovir without significant improvement in his condition. 
Testing for herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus was negative. 
Limbic encephalitis was suspected and the patient was treated with intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG) for five days. Venereal disease research laboratory and 
Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay were both tested positive in serum and 
CSF. Neurosyphilis was diagnosed, and the patient received a 14-day course of 
penicillin G with gradual improvement. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor 
(anti-NMDAR) antibodies were positive in serum, confirming the presence of 
encephalitis. The atypical clinical presentation of neurosyphilis with 
symptomatology mimicking encephalitis and no MRI abnormalities made the 
diagnosis challenging. Coexistence of neurosyphilis with anti-NMDAR encephalitis 
has been reported only in one recent study. Our case demonstrates the importance 
of testing for syphilis in patients with unexplained neurologic deficits and 
suspected encephalitis.

Leukocytes travel within the circulation and enter connective tissues by 
interactions with endothelium of postcapillary venules mediated by cell adhesion 
molecules, summarized as the leukocyte adhesion cascade. In the severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial 
fibroblasts (SF) migrated to distant cartilage through the vasculature. 
Therefore, RASF adhesion toward endothelial cells (EC) and E- and P-selectins 
were analyzed. Cell-to-cell binding assays between SF and EC were performed. 
Interactions of SF with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-activated EC or selectins 
were analyzed in flow adhesion assays. Immunohistochemistry for E-selectin 
ligand CD15s was performed. CD15s induction in RASF by human serum or media was 
evaluated. Wild-type and E-/-/ P-/- Selectin-SCID mice were used for 
inverse-wrap surgery. After laser-mediated microdissection, real-time PCR for 
E-/P-selectin/vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 was performed. Adhesion between 
SF/EC under static conditions was highest in Roswell Park Memorial 
Institute-cultured RASF to TNFαα-activated human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (2.25-fold) and RASF adhesion was higher toward venous than arterial EC 
(Dulbecco's modified eagle medium P = 0.0419, RPMI P = 0.0119). In flow chamber 
assays, RASF adhesion to E-selectin was higher than to P-selectin (e.g. 
0.9 dyn cm-2 P = 0.0001). Osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts showed lower 
rolling/adhesion properties (e.g. 0.5 dyn cm-2 , P = 0.0010). RASF adhesion to 
TNFαα-activated EC was increased (e.g. 0.9 dyn cm-2 , P = 0.0061). CD15s 
induction in RASF was strongest in RA serum. Vimentin/CD15s double-positive 
cells were detectable. In E-/P-selectin-deficient mice, contralateral invasion 
was reduced (P = 0.023). E- and P-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 
1 expression in EC of implants was confirmed. Our data indicate that the milieu 
within vessels induces CD15s which enables RASF to interact with E-selectin/EC 
under flow. Therefore, RASF may migrate to distant sites and leave the 
vasculature similarly to leukocytes.

CONTEXT: Whereas therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as 
nivolumab, have substantially improved survival in several types of cancer, 
increased attention has been given to adverse immune events associated with 
their use, including the development of endocrine autoimmunity.
OBJECTIVES: First, to describe a patient with a 2-year history of metastatic 
small cell lung cancer who had been treated with nivolumab a few months before 
presentation with the signs and symptoms of severe hypocalcemia and 
hypoparathyroidism. Second, to investigate the etiology of the patient's 
hypoparathyroidism, including the presence of activating autoantibodies against 
the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), as humoral and cellular immune responses 
against the CaSR have been reported in patients with autoimmune 
hypoparathyroidism.
PARTICIPANTS: A 61-year-old female was admitted with persistent nausea, 
vomiting, epigastric pain, constipation, and generalized weakness. Laboratory 
analyses showed low total serum calcium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid 
hormone (PTH). The patient was diagnosed with severe hypocalcemia as a result of 
autoimmune hypoparathyroidism after testing positive for CaSR-activating 
autoantibodies.
INTERVENTIONS: She was treated with intravenous calcium gluconate infusions, 
followed by a transition to oral calcium carbonate, plus calcitriol, which 
normalized her serum calcium.
RESULTS: Her serum PTH remained low during her hospitalization and initial 
outpatient follow-up, despite adequate repletion of magnesium.
CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates autoimmune hypoparathyroidism induced by ICI 
blockade. As ICIs are now used to treat many cancers, clinicians should be aware 
of the potential risk for hypocalcemia that may be associated with their use.

Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

The etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) involves multifaceted interactions 
between genetic loci and environmental factors. Smoking is an important risk 
factor for MS that overall increases the risk of the disease with approximately 
50%. However, the precise effects of smoking on MS development vary considerably 
in different contexts and in different populations. This review focuses on the 
influence of smoking on MS risk and its interaction with genetics in MS 
etiology. The possible biological mechanisms are presented in this paper. 
Further research is needed to establish the mechanisms of causality and to 
explore preventive strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To assess function using the Signals of Functional Impairment (SOFI) 
instrument over 8 years, to study clinical variables associated with the change, 
and to study change over time of the SOFI items.
METHODS: In total, 1,223 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the 
Better Anti-Rheumatic Farmacotherapy (BARFOT) cohort (mean ± SD age 56.9 ± 15.4 
years, 67% women) were included in the analysis. Data from baseline and from 1 
and 8 years were studied. The SOFI instrument includes measures of range of 
motion in the hand, shoulder/arm, and lower extremity (range 0-44, best to 
worst). The effects of baseline variables (sociodemographic, disease activity, 
joint destruction, and function) on change in SOFI scores were studied by linear 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: During the first year, the improvement in mean ± SD SOFI scores was 2.7 
± 5.7 (P < 0.001). Worse scores in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints and 
Health Assessment Questionnaire score at baseline were associated with this 
improvement (r2 ≤ 0.11). During the next 7 years, the deterioration in SOFI 
scores was mean ± SD 1.5 ± 4.9 (P < 0.001). Based on change scores, we found 
that finger flexion, pincer grip, and toe-standing were the most important items 
to measure, explaining 58-61% of the total SOFI score, and these items were also 
associated with radiographic changes at the 8-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Function as assessed with SOFI scores improved during the first year 
in patients with early RA, but it deteriorated slowly thereafter. Impaired hand 
and foot function was associated with joint destruction at the 8-year follow-up. 
Measures of hand and foot function will complement self-reported and medical 
data, both in clinical work and in long-term research studies.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic background influencing the development of 
cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which, after 
quality control and imputation, a total of 6,308,944 polymorphisms across the 
whole genome were analyzed in 2,989 RA patients of European origin. Data on 
subclinical atherosclerosis, obtained through assessment of carotid intima-media 
thickness (CIMT) and presence/absence of carotid plaques by carotid 
ultrasonography, were available for 1,355 individuals.
RESULTS: A genetic variant of the RARB gene (rs116199914) was associated with 
CIMT values at the genome-wide level of significance (minor allele [G] β 
coefficient 0.142, P = 1.86 × 10-8 ). Interestingly, rs116199914 overlapped with 
regulatory elements in tissues related to CV pathophysiology and immune cells. 
In addition, biologic pathway enrichment and predictive protein-protein 
relationship analyses, including suggestive GWAS signals of potential relevance, 
revealed a functional enrichment of the collagen biosynthesis network related to 
the presence/absence of carotid plaques (Gene Ontology no. 0032964; false 
discovery rate-adjusted P = 4.01 × 10-3 ). Furthermore, our data suggest 
potential influences of the previously described candidate CV risk loci NFKB1, 
MSRA, and ZC3HC1 (P = 8.12 × 10-4 , P = 5.94 × 10-4 , and P = 2.46 × 10-4 , 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: The present findings strongly suggest that genetic variation within 
RARB contributes to the development of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients 
with RA.

Several studies evaluated whether a person with multiple sclerosis is employed 
or not and investigated the main symptoms that hinder the job performance. 
However, despite occupational physicians are fundamental in managing disabled 
subjects, there is a serious lack of data regarding their role in improving 
employability of these workers. In this regard, we assessed occupational 
physicians' professional activity and training/updating needs in order to 
identify and develop management tools, operative procedures and training 
programs helpful to support and implement adequate job-retention strategies. 
Four hundred three Italian occupational physicians compiled a self-administered 
questionnaire to evaluate individual demographics, health surveillance system, 
fitness for work and training needs. Our findings confirmed the suitability to 
adopt environmental adjustments at workplace (particularly referring to the 
ergonomics of workstation, the typology of occupational risk factors and the 
working time) to accommodate individual's needs in order to improve working 
ability among multiple sclerosis workers. Moreover, training events discussing 
operational guidelines and standardized instruments and/or methodologies to 
adequately manage the disable workers should be fostered. Therefore, in this 
regard, occupational physicians could play a key role but they need more 
high-quality training especially concerning the different tools that are 
currently available to assess the work issues in multiple sclerosis patients.

INTRODUCTION: A prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) may be 
indicative of a specific or multiple factor deficiency, therapeutic 
anticoagulation, presence of a nonspecific factor inhibitor, or lupus 
anticoagulant (LA). Recently, pairing of the LA-sensitive APTT and standard APTT 
reagents, Cephen LS and Cephen, respectively, has been shown to be effective in 
LA detection. The present study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of this reagent 
pair for discriminating between causes of APTT elevation and the detection of LA 
in conjunction with dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT).
METHODS: Plasma samples from 50 normal and 105 non-anticoagulated LA-positive 
patients in routine dRVVT and/or dilute APTT (dAPTT) via the percent correction 
formula were employed. Cephen LS/Cephen and dRVVT reagents LA1/LA2 were used to 
screen/confirm, respectively. Thirty-four symptomatic LA-negative, 25 
warfarinised non-antiphospholipid syndrome, 6 coagulation inhibitors, 17 samples 
with hereditary elevated APTT, and 24 FVIII/IX/XI/XII and 17 FII/V/X artificial 
single deficiency plasmas were used.
RESULTS: Thirty-three samples out of 105 (31%) were LA-positive in Cephen 
LS/Cephen. The total percent positivity in Cephen LS/Cephen and LA1/LA2 pairs 
was 89.1% against samples with the routine dRVVT/dAPTT double positive. The 
percent corrections of Cephen LS/Cephen in the routine dAPTT/dRVVT positive 
group were significantly higher than those in all other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The percent correction of the APTT reagent pair showed higher 
values in LA-positive samples. The combination will be useful with respect to 
differentiating LA from other abnormal samples and is effective in LA detection 
when paired with dRVVT.

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of 
dehydrated human umbilical cord allograft (EpiCord) compared with alginate wound 
dressings for the treatment of chronic, non-healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). 
A multicentre, randomised, controlled, clinical trial was conducted at 11 
centres in the United States. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 
or Type 2 diabetes presenting with a 1 to 15 cm2 ulcer located below the ankle 
that had been persisting for at least 30 days were eligible for the 14-day study 
run-in phase. After 14 days of weekly debridement, moist wound therapy, and 
off-loading, those with ≤30% wound area reduction post-debridement (n = 155) 
were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a weekly application of EpiCord 
(n = 101) or standardised therapy with alginate wound dressing, non-adherent 
silicone dressing, absorbent non-adhesive hydropolymer secondary dressing, and 
gauze bandage roll (n = 54). All wounds continued to have appropriate 
off-loading during the treatment phase of the study. Study visits were conducted 
for 12 weeks. At each weekly visit, the DFU was cleaned and debrided as 
necessary, with the wound photographed pre- and post-debridement and measured 
before the application of treatment group-specific dressings. A follow-up visit 
was performed at week 16. The primary study end point was the percentage of 
complete closure of the study ulcer within 12 weeks, as assessed by Silhouette 
camera. Data for randomised subjects meeting study inclusion criteria were 
included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Additional analysis was conducted 
on a group of subjects (n = 134) who completed the study per protocol (PP) 
(EpiCord, n = 86, alginate, n = 48) and for those subjects receiving adequate 
debridement (EpiCord, n = 67, alginate, n = 40). ITT analysis showed that DFUs 
treated with EpiCord were more likely to heal within 12 weeks than those 
receiving alginate dressings, 71 of 101 (70%) vs 26 of 54 (48%) for EpiCord and 
alginate dressings, respectively, P = 0.0089. Healing rates at 12 weeks for 
subjects treated PP were 70 of 86 (81%) for EpiCord-treated and 26 of 48 (54%) 
for alginate-treated DFUs, P = 0.0013. For those DFUs that received adequate 
debridement (n = 107, ITT population), 64 of 67 (96%) of the EpiCord-treated 
ulcers healed completely within 12 weeks, compared with 26 of 40 (65%) of 
adequately debrided alginate-treated ulcers, P < 0.0001. Seventy-five subjects 
experienced at least one adverse event, with a total of 160 adverse events 
recorded. There were no adverse events related to either EpiCord or alginate 
dressings. These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of EpiCord as a 
treatment for non-healing DFUs.

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is one of the most common organ-specific 
autoimmune disorders. It mainly manifests as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and 
Graves' disease (GD). HT is characteristic of hypothyroidism resulting from the 
destruction of the thyroid while GD is characteristic of hyperthyroidism due to 
excessive production of thyroid hormone induced by thyrotropin receptor-specific 
stimulatory autoantibodies. T lymphocytes and their secretory cytokines play 
indispensable roles in modulating immune responses, but their roles are often 
complex and full of interactions among distinct components of the immune system. 
Dysfunction of these T cells or aberrant expressions of these cytokines can 
cause the breakdown of immune tolerance and result in aberrant immune responses 
during the development of AITDs. This review summarizes recently identified T 
subsets and related cytokines and their roles in the pathogenesis of AITDs with 
the hope to provide a better understanding of the precise roles of notably 
identified T subsets in AITDs and facilitate the discovery of functional 
molecules or novel immune therapeutic targets for AITDs.

BACKGROUND: Biologic agents (BAs) enabled not only a reduction of disease 
activity but also a slowing down of structural damage to the joints in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the incidence of cervical lesions in 
patients with RA is still high.
PURPOSE: To elucidate the predictors for the progression of two different 
cervical lesions in patients with RA under BA treatment.
METHODS: Of 151 subjects who received more than two years of continuous BA 
treatment, 101 subjects who had cervical X-ray images taken at baseline and 
final visit were enrolled. The mean disease duration and mean radiography 
interval were 10.6 years and 4.4 years, respectively. The existence and 
progression of cervical lesions (atlanto-axial subluxation [AAS], vertical 
subluxation [VS], and subaxial subluxation [SS]) were investigated. And 
predictors for the AAS or VS progression were analyzed by multivariate logistic 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: The incidence of cervical lesions at baseline were no pre-existing 
cervical lesion (none) in 50 cases (50%), AAS only in 32 (32%), both AAS and VS 
in 12 (12%), and VS only in 7 cases (7%). In the none group, only 4 cases of AAS 
progression (8%) was observed during the follow-up. In contrast, in the groups 
with pre-existing cervical lesions, a high incidence of VS progression was 
observed (63% in the AAS only group, 58% in the AAS + VS group, and 71% in the 
VS only group). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the DAS-CRP 
value at baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 9.23) and matrix metaloprotease-3 level at 
baseline (OR = 1.01) were significant predictors for the progression of AAS, and 
pre-existing AAS (OR = 18.38) was a sole significant predictor for the 
progression of VS.
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical lesions progressed irrespective of disease activity after 
AAS development. Strict disease control before the development of AAS is crucial 
for preventing further progression and development of cervical lesions.

Smoking is a risk factor for the development and progression of multiple 
sclerosis (MS); however, the pathogenic effects of smoking are poorly 
understood. We studied the smoking-associated chemokine receptor-like molecule 
GPR15 in relation to relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Using microarray analyses 
and qPCR we found elevated GPR15 in blood cells from smokers, and increased 
GPR15 expression in RRMS. By flow cytometry we detected increased frequencies of 
GPR15 expressing T and B cells in smokers, but no difference between patients 
with RRMS and healthy controls. However, after cell culture with the 
autoantigens myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, 
frequencies of MBP-reactive and non-proliferating GPR15+CD4+ T cells were 
increased in patients with RRMS compared with healthy controls. GPR15+CD4+ T 
cells produced IL-17 and were enriched in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
Furthermore, in the CSF of patients with RRMS, GPR15+ T cells were associated 
with CCR6+CXCR3+/CCR6-CXCR3+ phenotypes and correlated positively with 
concentrations of the newly identified GPR15-ligand (GPR15L), myelin degradation 
and disability. In conclusion, we have identified a proinflammatory cell type 
linking smoking with pathogenic immune cell functions in RRMS.

To investigate the characteristics and associated factors for Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (TB) infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
from Southern China. A retrospective study of 1108 patients admitted to the 
First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from January 2007 to 
December 2017 was performed. Demographic and clinical characteristics, 
laboratory data, and radiographic manifestations were recorded. A total of 59 
(5.3%) lupus patients with active TB were included. Pulmonary TB occurred in 41 
(69.5%) patients. Single lobe involvement was showed in 14 (34.1%) patients. 
Multi-lobar involvement, including miliary TB (36.6%), was presented in 27 
(65.8%) patients. Lower lobe involvement accounted for 31 (75.6%) of the cases. 
Extrapulmonary TB occurred in 18 (30.5%) patients. Nearly one-third (35.6%) of 
the patients developed disseminated TB. T-SPOT.TB assay was performed in 23 
patients and positive in 18 patients (78.3%). Nineteen patients (32.2%) had 
co-infection with TB and other pathogens, most of which were 
bacterial-associated (52.6%). Lymphopenia was predominant in TB-infected 
patients, especially in those with disseminated TB. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis found that lymphopenia [odds ratio (OR) = 2.19, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.03-4.63, P = 0.04] and the accumulated doses of 
glucocorticoid (GC) (OR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.69-3.20, P < 0.001) were associated 
with TB. TB infection is a common comorbidity in patients with SLE. 
Manifestations of pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan are relatively 
atypical. Co-infection with TB and other pathogens is not rare. Lymphopenia and 
the accumulated doses of GC are associated with TB infection in lupus patients.

OBJECTIVE: Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACI) are a fundamental 
part in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The current situation of 
IACI is reviewed in a population of children.
METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature related to IACI in 
children, with respect to the injection technique, use of local and general 
anesthesia, ultrasound guidance of the procedure, indications, special joints 
and type of optimal corticosteroid.
RESULTS: IACI are indicated in any subcategory of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
especially in oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The use of local 
anesthetic is highly recommended, and in patients younger than 6 years or 
requiring multiple joint injections, conscious sedation can also be an option. 
Ultrasound guidance of injections is recommended in expert hands, but not in a 
generalized way. Triamcinolone hexacetonide is the corticosteroid of choice in 
large joints, whereas a more soluble corticosteroid is a better alternative in 
small or superficial joints (betamethasone or methylprednisolone) to avoid 
subcutaneous atrophy or hypopigmentation, the most frequent adverse effect of 
IACI.
CONCLUSIONS: IACI are performed heterogeneously and scientific evidence is 
limited in many cases.

AIMS: Children and adolescents with a family history of diabetes are at 
increased risk of overweight, but little is known about the potentially 
beneficial effects of physical activity on these children. The objective of this 
study was to investigate the association between moderate to vigorous physical 
activity (MVPA) and metabolic and inflammatory risks in children and adolescents 
with a family background of Type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes.
METHODS: Valid MVPA measurements, made with accelerometers, were available from 
234 participants (median age, 10.2 years) who had a first-degree relative with 
either Type 1 or gestational diabetes. Anthropometric and metabolic measurements 
were made and cytokines measured, and were correlated with MVPA measurements, 
with stepwise adjustment for confounding factors, in a cross-sectional analysis.
RESULTS: MVPA was negatively associated with insulin and C-peptide during 
challenge with an oral glucose tolerance test. MVPA was also significantly 
positively associated with the insulin sensitivity index, whereas no 
consistently significant associations were found between MVPA and BMI, blood 
pressure or cytokine levels.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that physical activity may have beneficial 
effects on insulin and C-peptide metabolism in children and adolescents with a 
family background of diabetes, but show no evidence of a protective association 
with other health-related outcomes.

Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.

The objective of this paper was to explore the role and molecular mechanism of 
miR-193a in membranous nephropathy (MN). Experimental rats and podocytes were 
randomly divided into four groups: control, MN, miR-NC, and miR-193a inhibitor 
groups. The relative mRNA level of miR-193a was determined. The mRNA level and 
protein expression of PODXL, NPHS1, and Notch1 were determined by real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. The 
mRNA level and protein expression of WT1 in podocytes were also determined by 
RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The relative mRNA level of miR-193a in the MN 
group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and inhibition of 
miR-193a inhibited the increase successfully. Inhibition of miR-193a inhibited 
renal injury, podocyte injury, and tissue cell apoptosis resulting from MN. The 
expression of PODXL, NPHS1, and Notch1 was decreased in the MN group, while the 
expression was increased in the miR-193a inhibitor group. WT1 was verified as a 
target gene of miR-193a and the expression of WT1 increased after inhibition of 
miR-193a. Inhibition of miR-193a by targeting WT1 could inhibit renal function 
injury, renal tissue cell apoptosis, and podocytosis.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common autoimmune disease in humans 
usually associated with subsequent hypothyroidism. The purpose of the study was 
to assess metabolic alterations within the normal appearing brain in subjects 
with HT using MR spectroscopy (MRS) and to correlate MRS measurements with 
hormonal concentrations. Fifty-five HT patients (mean age 43.5 yrs) and 30 
healthy controls (mean age 42.5 yrs) were examined with the use of a 1.5 T MR 
scanner. There were no signs of central nervous system involvement in the 
studied group. The MRS examinations were performed using the single voxel 
method. The voxels were placed in the left parietal white matter (PWM) and the 
posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG). The NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr ratios were 
calculated. The correlations between metabolite ratios and hormonal 
concentrations (TSH, fT3, fT4) as well as anti-TG and anti-TPO levels were also 
assessed. We found significantly (p < 0.05) decreased NAA/Cr ratios in PCG and 
PWM in HT subjects compared to the control group. There were no other 
significant differences in metabolite ratios. We observed significant positive 
correlations between the NAA/Cr ratio in PCG as well as the PWM and fT3 level. 
There was also a significant negative correlation between the Cho/Cr ratio in 
the PCG and fT4 level. MRS could be a sensitive biomarker capable of depicting 
early cerebral metabolic disturbances associated with HT. Our findings may 
indicate the reduction of neuronal activity within the normal appearing brain in 
patients with HT as well as suggesting that there is a possible biological 
association between thyroid dysfunction and cerebral metabolic changes.

Several recently published clinical trials have shown tofacitinib to be 
effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This drug is commonly 
prescribed either in a 5-mg or in a10-mg dosage twice daily. In this review, we 
aimed to systematically compare the adverse drug events which were observed with 
5 mg versus 10 mg tofacitinib for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and www.ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (from 
March to April 2018) for suitable English publications (published before April 
2018). The inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized controlled trials, 
autoimmune disorders (rheumatic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, moderate to 
severe psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis), and comparison of adverse drug 
events associated with 5 mg versus 10 mg tofacitinib. This study had follow-up 
time periods of 3 months and ≥ 6 months. Statistical analysis was carried out by 
RevMan 5.3 whereby risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
generated. A total number of 4287 participants were included (2144 versus 2143 
participants who received 5 mg and 10 mg tofacitinib twice daily respectively). 
The results showed that at 3 months, similar risks of adverse drug events, 
serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to drug discontinuation were 
observed with 5 mg versus 10 mg tofacitinib (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98-1.10; 
P = 0.17, I2 = 0%; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77-1.48; P = 0.71, I2 = 0%; and RR 1.06, 
95% CI 0.78-1.43; P = 0.73, I2 = 32%, respectively). The other outcomes 
including serious infection events, adjudicated herpes zoster infection, 
adjudicated opportunistic infection, mild and severe neutropenia, malignancies, 
and adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events were also similarly 
manifested. However, a decreased level of hemoglobin significantly favored 5 mg 
tofacitinib (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.19-2.58; P = 0.005, I2 = 49%). Even at a 
follow-up time period of ≥ 6 months, adverse drug events, serious adverse 
events, adverse drug events leading to drug discontinuation, and serious 
infection were still similarly observed. According to this current review, both 
dosages of tofacitinib were safe to use. Even if similar adverse drug events 
were observed with 5 mg versus 10 mg tofacitinib twice daily for the treatment 
of autoimmune disorders, anemia was more prominent with 10 mg tofacitinib at a 
3 month follow-up. Nevertheless, future studies based on a larger population 
size with longer follow-up time periods should further be considered.

miR-410-3p Suppresses Cytokine Release from Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes by 
Regulating NF-κB Signaling in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

miR-410-3p acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in some malignancies. 
However, its role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unknown. The study was 
conducted to investigate the effect of miR-410-3p on the pathogenesis of RA. 
Real-time RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA levels of miR-410-3p in synovial 
tissues and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). An ELISA was performed to 
examine the production levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin 
(IL)-1β, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. Western blotting was 
conducted to determine the protein levels of IκB-α, p-IκBα, p65, and p-p65. 
Nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation and nuclear translocation assays were 
performed to confirm the activation of NF-κB. We found that the expression level 
of miR-410-3p was downregulated in synovial tissues and FLSs from RA. 
Overexpression of miR-410-3p significantly reduced the secretion of TNF-α, 
IL-1β, IL-6, and MMP-9 in human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS-RA); 
whereas miR-410-3p inhibition increased the expression levels of these 
cytokines. Furthermore, miR-410-3p suppresses the activation of NF-κB signaling 
pathway. Moreover, NF-κB inhibitor restored the elevation of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, 
and MMP-9 induced by miR-410-3p inhibition. Our results demonstrate that 
miR-410-3p acts an inflammatory suppressor in the pathogenesis of RA by 
regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. These data suggest a novel function of 
miR-410-3p and provide insight into the complex mechanisms involved in RA.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the cross-sectional robustness of commonly used 
volumetric software and effects of lesion filling in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: Nine MS patients (six females; age 38±13 years, disease duration 
7.3±5.2 years) were scanned twice with repositioning on three MRI scanners 
(Siemens Aera 1.5T, Avanto 1.5T, Trio 3.0T) the same day. Volumetric T1-weighted 
images were processed with FreeSurfer, FSL-SIENAX, SPM and SPM-CAT before and 
after 3D FLAIR lesion filling with LST. The whole-brain, grey matter (GM) and 
white matter (WM) volumes were calculated with and without normalisation to the 
intracranial volume or FSL-SIENAX scaling factor. Robustness was assessed using 
the coefficient of variation (CoV).
RESULTS: Variability in volumetrics was lower within than between scanners (CoV 
0.17-0.96% vs. 0.65-5.0%, p<0.001). All software provided similarly robust 
segmentations of the brain volume on the same scanner (CoV 0.17-0.28%, p=0.076). 
Normalisation improved inter-scanner reproducibility in FreeSurfer and SPM-based 
methods, but the FSL-SIENAX scaling factor did not improve robustness. 
Generally, SPM-based methods produced the most consistent volumetrics, while 
FreeSurfer was more robust for WM volumes on different scanners. FreeSurfer had 
more robust normalised brain and GM volumes on different scanners than 
FSL-SIENAX (p=0.004). MS lesion filling changed the output of FSL-SIENAX, SPM 
and SPM-CAT but not FreeSurfer.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent use of the same scanner is essential and normalisation 
to the intracranial volume is recommended for multiple scanners. Based on 
robustness, SPM-based methods are particularly suitable for cross-sectional 
volumetry. FreeSurfer poses a suitable alternative with WM segmentations less 
sensitive to MS lesions.
KEY POINTS: • The same scanner should be used for brain volumetry. If different 
scanners are used, the intracranial volume normalisation improves the FreeSurfer 
and SPM robustness (but not the FSL scaling factor). • FreeSurfer, FSL and SPM 
all provide robust measures of the whole brain volume on the same MRI scanner. 
SPM-based methods overall provide the most robust segmentations (except white 
matter segmentations on different scanners where FreeSurfer is more robust). • 
MS lesion filling with Lesion Segmentation Toolbox changes the output of 
FSL-SIENAX and SPM. FreeSurfer output is not affected by MS lesion filling since 
it already takes white matter hypointensities into account and is therefore 
particularly suitable for MS brain volumetry.

BACKGROUND: Because multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease causing 
disability over decades, it is crucial to know if the short-term effects of 
disease-modifying therapies reported in randomised controlled trials reduce 
long-term disability. This 10-year prospective observational study of disability 
outcomes (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and utility) was set up, in 
conjunction with a risk-sharing agreement between payers and producers, to 
investigate this issue.
METHODS: The outcomes of the UK treated patients were compared with a modelled 
untreated control based on the British Columbia MS data set to assess the 
long-term effectiveness of these treatments. Two complementary analysis models 
were used: a multilevel model (MLM) and a continuous Markov model.
RESULTS: 4862 patients with MS were eligible for the primary analysis (mean and 
median follow-up times 8.7 and 10 years). EDSS worsening was reduced by 28% 
(MLM), 7% (Markov) and 24% time-adjusted Markov in the total cohort, and by 31% 
(MLM) and 14% (Markov) for relapsing remitting patients. The utility worsening 
was reduced by 23%-24% in the total cohort and by 24%-31% in the RR patients 
depending on the model used. All sensitivity analyses showed a treatment effect. 
There was a 4-year (CI 2.7 to 5.3) delay to EDSS 6.0. An apparent waning of 
treatment effect with time was seen. Subgroup analyses suggested better 
treatment effects in those treated earlier and with lower EDSS scores.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a beneficial effect on long-term disability 
with first-line MS disease-modifying treatments, which is clinically meaningful. 
However the waning effect noted requires further study.

Chronic inflammatory diseases are often progressive, resulting not only in 
physical damage to patients but also social and economic burdens, making early 
diagnosis of them critical. Nuclear medicine techniques can enhance the 
detection of inflammation by providing functional as well as anatomical 
information when combined with other modalities such as magnetic resonance 
imaging, computed tomography or ultrasonography. Although small molecules and 
peptides were mainly used for the treatment and imaging of chronic inflammatory 
diseases in the past, antibodies and their fragments have also been emerging for 
chronic inflammatory diseases as they show high specificity to their targets and 
can have various biological half-lives depending on how they are engineered. In 
addition, imaging with antibodies or their fragments can visualize the in vivo 
biodistribution of the probes or help monitor therapeutic responses, thereby 
providing physicians with a greater understanding of drug behavior in vivo and 
another means of monitoring their patients. In this review, we introduce various 
targets and radiolabeled antibody-based probes for the molecular imaging of 
chronic inflammatory diseases in preclinical and clinical studies. Targets can 
be classified into three different categories: 1) cell-adhesion molecules, 
2) surface markers on immune cells, and 3) cytokines or enzymes. The limitations 
and future directions of using radiolabeled antibodies for imaging inflammatory 
diseases are also discussed.

OBJECTIVES: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a mainstay of treatment for patients with 
ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) but are associated with significant adverse 
effects. Effective remission induction in severe AAV using extremely limited GC 
exposure has not been attempted. We tested an early rapid GC withdrawal 
induction regimen for patients with severe AAV.
METHODS: Patients with active MPO- or PR3-ANCA vasculitis or ANCA-negative 
pauci-immune glomerulonephritis were included. Induction treatment consisted of 
two doses of rituximab, 3 months of low-dose CYC and a short course of oral GC 
(for between 1 and 2 weeks). Clinical, biochemical and immunological outcomes as 
well as adverse events were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were included, with at least 12 months of 
follow-up in 46. All patients achieved remission, with decreases observed in 
creatinine, proteinuria, CRP, ANCA level and BVAS. Three patients requiring 
dialysis at presentation became dialysis independent. Two patients required the 
introduction of maintenance GC for treatment of vasculitis. Overall outcomes 
were comparable to those of two matched cohorts (n = 172) from previous European 
Vasculitis Society (EUVAS) trials, but with lower total exposure to CYC and GCs 
(P < 0.001) and reduced rates of severe infections (P = 0.02) compared with the 
RITUXVAS (rituximab versus cyclophosphamide in AAV) trial. We found no new cases 
of diabetes in the first year compared with historic rates of 8.2% from the 
EUVAS trials (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Early GC withdrawal in severe AAV is as effective for remission 
induction as the standard of care and is associated with reduced GC-related 
adverse events.

PURPOSE: To study peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPCT) around the optic disc 
and establish zones using a new swept source optical coherence tomography 
(SS-OCT) device. To evaluate PPCT differences between patients with multiple 
sclerosis (MS) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
METHODS: A total of 102 healthy subjects and 51 patients with MS were 
consecutively recruited. Healthy subjects were divided into teaching (n = 51, 
used to establish choroidal zones) and validating (n = 51, used to compare 
measurements with MS patients) populations. An optic disc 6.0 × 6.0-mm 
three-dimensional scan was obtained using SS-OCT Triton. A 26 × 26 cube-grid 
centred on the optic disc was generated automatically to measure PPCT. Four 
choroidal zones were established and used to compare PPCT between healthy 
controls and patients with MS.
RESULTS: Peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPCT) was significantly thinner in 
patients in all concentric zones (p ≤ 0.0001): 134.02 ± 16.59 μm in MS group 
versus 171.56 ± 12.43 μm in the control group in zone 2; 182.23 ± 20.52 versus 
219.03 ± 17.99 μm, respectively, in zone 3; and 223.52 ± 10.70 versus 
259.99 ± 10.29 μm, respectively, in zone 4. The choroidal thinning in the MS 
group tended to decrease as we distanced from the optic nerve head. 
Peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPCT) had a similar pattern in controls and 
MS; it was thicker in the superior region, followed by temporal, nasal and 
inferior regions.
CONCLUSION: Patients with MS showed peripapillary choroidal thinning when 
compared with healthy subjects in all zones around the optic disc. Peripapillary 
choroidal tissue shows a concentric pattern, increasing in thickness when 
increasing the distance from the optic nerve. The new SS-OCT could be useful for 
evaluating choroidal thinning in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating autoimmune disease of the 
central nervous system. T2W-hyperintense demyelinating lesions are detected in 
cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) 
have frequently been detected in enhanced cranial MRI images, and are generally 
accepted as normal variants of venous development. The aim of the present study 
was to investigate whether there was an association between demyelinating 
diseases and venous anomalies.
METHODS: One hundred five patients who were diagnosed as having MS in accordance 
with the McDonald diagnostic criteria, and 105 patients who were diagnosed as 
having vascular headache who had no lesions similar to MS were included in the 
present retrospective study.
RESULTS: DVAs were detected in 31 of the study group and in 14 patients in the 
control group. A statistically significant higher rate of DVAs and abnormal 
signal increase in the neighboring tissue was detected in the study group 
(p = 0.004) (p = 0.006). The DVA was superficially localized in the RRMS, It was 
deeply located in RIS.
CONCLUSION: Recent studies have emphasized the association of the central vein 
and the lesion severity of MS with the detection of the central collecting vein 
in MS lesions. In our study, DVAs, which are generally regarded as innocent 
developmental anomalies, and neighboring signal increase were found 
significantly higher in the MS group compared with the control group. The role 
of DVAs in the etiology of demyelinating lesions must be clarified through 
comprehensive future studies that use more advanced techniques.

PURPOSE: Recent studies highlighted that early diabetic neurodegeneration is 
present before microvascular changes are visible. Retinal neurodegeneration can 
decrease retinal layer thickness. We aimed to determine whether decreased 
retinal layer thickness is present already in the early time course of disease.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of patients and healthy adults from the 
German Diabetes Study (GDS, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier number: CT01055093, 
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01055093). Inclusion criteria were a 
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) within the last 12 months. Retinal layers 
thickness in the nasal pericentral segment was measured by spectral domain 
ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For statistical analysis proc mixed 
(sas-version 9.4) was used.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-eight eyes of 89 patients with type 1 DM (58 
males, age 36 ± 11 years, BMI 25.5 ± 4.2 kg/m²) and 242 eyes of 121 patients 
with type 2 DM (84 males, age 53 ± 10 years, BMI 31.9 ± 6.3 kg/m²) with a 
disease duration of less than 1 year were compared to 76 eyes of 38 controls (27 
males, age 41 ± 16 years, BMI 27.3 ± 6.4 kg/m²). Analysis of retinal layer 
thickness and visual function did not reveal a significant difference between 
patients and controls.
CONCLUSION: In the early course of DM potential, neurodegeneration does not 
relate to measureable changes of retinal layer thickness.

Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) is rare in many regions of 
the world, including Europe. Access to approved medications for cSLE is 
currently limited, among others, due to a lack of high-quality evidence from 
clinical trials. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the current 
regulatory framework regarding medication approvals, delineate barriers to 
clinical trial conduct, and strategies to improve access to new medications for 
cSLE. Relevant methodological and regulatory aspects, epidemiological data, 
study designs and outcome measures are reviewed, and the results of a survey 
among Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation/Pediatric 
Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group investigators are presented. Laws and 
regulations in the USA and Europe necessitate that novel medicines are studied 
in paediatric populations, if similar or the same diseases in adults have been 
found to benefit from them. Regulatory agencies consider cSLE the paediatric 
form of SLE in adults. For medicines that have been found safe and effective in 
adult SLE, paediatric extrapolation strategies can limit the number and 
complexity of studies needed to support the labelling of these medicines for use 
in cSLE. In this setting, specialised research networks, validated outcome 
measures, stakeholder input, study designs as well as statistical methods 
successfully used in other uncommon diseases will help improve study efficiency 
in an effort to enhance the speed with which new drugs for cSLE can be studied. 
Open-label pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies are preferred by paediatric 
rheumatologists over double-blind parallel designs for cSLE trials. Appropriate 
infrastructure, outcome measures and sufficient numbers of patients are 
available for the testing of new medicines for children with cSLE.

INTRODUCTION: We sought to evaluate the test-retest reliability and construct 
validity of the 6- and 2-minute walk tests (6mWT and 2mWT, respectively) in 
patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).
METHODS: Thirty-one patients with generalized MG were enrolled in this study. 
The 6mWT, 2mWT, MG-specific quality of life questionnaire Turkish version 
(MG-QoL15T), quantitative myasthenia gravis test (QMG), and pulmonary function 
tests were administered.
RESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficients of 2mWT and 6mWT were 0.894 and 
0.932, respectively. The 6mWT and 2mWT had moderate correlations with forced 
vital capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure, QMG score, and MG-QoL15T score (ρ 
for 6mWT: 0.579, 0.539, -0.572, and -0.474; ρ for 2mWT: 0.460, 0.446, -0.532, 
-0.457). Both tests had similar performances for predicting disease severity 
(area under the curve = 0.761 for 6mWT and 0.759 for 2mWT).
DISCUSSION: The 6mWT and 2mWT have excellent test-retest reliability as well as 
moderate construct validity for the evaluation of functional exercise capacity 
patients with MG. Muscle Nerve 59:208-212, 2019.

Encapsulated porcine islets could be used to treat type I diabetes without 
necessitating severe immunosuppression. Islet survival and secretory function in 
the encapsulation device need to be preserved to ensure efficient insulin output 
in response to surrounding stimuli. In the present study, we evaluated 
stimulated insulin secretion from adult and neonatal pig islets seeded on an 
acellular collagen matrix and encapsulated in alginate during long-term culture. 
Pig islets survived longer and secreted more insulin when cultured on acellular 
porcine dermis compared to human fascia. Islets from neonatal pigs could survive 
up to 33 weeks in vitro, and their insulin secretion increased during the first 
5 weeks of culture in a beta-cell maturation medium. In fact, by the 4th week of 
culture, insulin secretion from neonatal islets attained the same level as adult 
islets and even surpassed it by the 18th week. Our results show that in vitro 
maturation of encapsulated neonatal porcine islets is possible and can actually 
compensate the initial low insulin secretion from these islets while allowing 
enough time to perform complete functional and biosafety characterization of 
islets before transplantation.

During the life of a human being, several tons of apoptotic cells and debris are 
produced. These apoptotic particles should be cleared quickly and accurately 
from the body, as they may lose their membrane integrity with the probability of 
leakage of cytotoxic materials and other intracellular antigens into the 
environment. The action of removing apoptotic particles occurs by a process 
called efferocytosis. Efferocytosis is a highly regulated balance among a set of 
find-me, eat-me and don't-eat-me signals. Efferocytosis is accompanied by a 
suppression of the immune system that can explain its negative role in cancer. 
Additionally, defects in this process can lead to different diseases. In this 
review, we aim to describe the mechanism of efferocytosis and evaluate its 
association with the development of autoimmune diseases, airway inflammation, 
atherosclerosis and cancer to open a new window for the treatment of these 
diseases.

Population Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response Relationship of Intravenous 
and Subcutaneous Abatacept in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Abatacept population pharmacokinetics (PK) and exposure-response (E-R) models 
for selective efficacy end points were developed using phase 2 and 3 study data 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with abatacept (intravenous [IV] 
or subcutaneous [SC]), followed by simulations. Two efficacy end points were 
assessed in the E-R analyses: Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) and 
American College of Rheumatology response criteria for 20/50/70% improvement 
(ACR20/50/70). The analyses were performed with data from 11 clinical studies 
for the population PK analysis and from 3 clinical studies for the E-R analyses 
(DAS28 and ACR20/50/70). The PK of abatacept were time invariant and can be 
described by a linear 2-compartment model with first-order elimination and with 
zero-order IV infusion or first-order absorption for SC abatacept. Baseline body 
weight was the only clinically meaningful covariate; that is, abatacept 
clearance and volume of central compartment increased with increasing baseline 
body weight. Steady-state trough concentration (Cminss ) of abatacept was 
identified as the best exposure predictor of DAS28 response compared with other 
exposure measures. In addition, the E-R relationship was the same for IV and SC 
abatacept. Similar results were confirmed in the ACR20/50/70 E-R analyses. 
Efficacy responses increased with increasing Cminss and a near-maximal response 
was associated with Cminss ≥10 μg/mL. The model-based analyses confirmed that 
the weight-tiered ∼10 mg/kg IV and fixed 125 mg SC abatacept dosing regimens are 
comparable and achieved plateau responses, by delivering Cminss ≥10 μg/mL in RA 
patients across all body weights.

Our previous study revealed that Yin Yang 1(YY1) played an important part in 
promoting interleukin (IL)-6 production in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, 
whether YY1 has any role in regulation of IL-8 in RA remains unclear. YY1 and 
IL-8 expression in RA patients were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to analyze the 
signaling pathway involved in YY1-induced IL-8 production. The expression of YY1 
and proteins involved in the pathway were detected by Western blot and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Migration of neutrophils was 
performed by chemotaxis assay. In this study, we found that high expression of 
IL-8 was positively associated with YY1 expression in RA. Blocking YY1 
expression by YY1-short hairpin (sh)RNA lentivirus reduced IL-8 production. 
Mechanistically, we showed YY1 activated IL-8 production via the 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) 
signaling pathway. Further, using a co-culture system consisting of peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neutrophils, we found that migration of 
neutrophils would be inhibited by YY1 RNA interference. Finally, using the 
collagen-induced arthritis animal model, we showed that treatment with the 
YY1-shRNA lentivirus led to reduction of IL-8 levels and attenuation of 
inflammation and neutrophil infiltration in vivo. Our results reveal a role of 
YY1 involved in neutrophil infiltration in RA via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/IL-8 
signaling pathway. YY1 may be a new therapeutic target for treatment of RA.

This study systematically compares HTA recommendations on a number of 
disease-modifying therapies for patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple 
Sclerosis. We analysed publicly available HTA reports for nine 
medicine-indication pairs across seven OECD countries using a methodological 
framework enabling systematic analysis of HTA recommendations. The analysis was 
conducted based on a number of value dimensions, including clinical and economic 
variables, as well as several other dimensions of value beyond 
cost-effectiveness. The material was qualitatively and quantitatively coded 
following the different stages of HTA decision-making process. Fifty-seven 
medicine-indication pairs were assessed across the study countries. Of those, 
eight medicine indication-pairs reported diverging HTA recommendations. Although 
HTA recommendations were based on the same evidence submitted in most cases, 
significant variations were identified in interpretation and acceptance of 
evidence resulting in different uncertainties raised and different ways of 
addressing them. Uncertainties arose both in terms of the clinical and the 
economic evidence, including the design of key trials or the data quality in 
economic models. Beyond costs and effects, additional dimensions of value had an 
impact in the direction of recommendations, however with different magnitude 
across countries. We show that there is heterogeneity across countries in HTA 
for evaluating DMTs for RRMS with a lack of standardised methods in evaluating 
clinical and economic evidence and the use of social value judgments to inform 
decision-making.

Worsening of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is associated with the initiation of 
effective treatment of glycaemia in some patients with diabetes. It has been 
associated with risk factors such as poor blood-glucose control and 
hypertension, and it manifests prior to the long-term benefits of optimizing 
glycaemic control. The majority of evidence supports an association of large and 
rapid reductions in blood-glucose levels with early worsening of DR. Despite a 
general awareness of early worsening within the diabetes community, mechanisms 
to explain the phenomenon remain speculative. We provide an overview of early 
worsening of DR and its pathophysiology based on current data. We describe the 
phenomenon in various settings, including in patients receiving insulin- or 
non-insulin-based treatments, in those undergoing bariatric surgery, and in 
pregnant women. We discuss various mechanisms and theories that have been 
suggested to explain this paradoxical phenomenon, and we summarize the 
implications of these in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: A range of different neurological manifestations has been reported 
in fetuses and adults after Zika virus (ZIKV) infection.
OBJECTIVE: We describe a detection of the ZIKV in the brain tissue from a 
multiple sclerosis (MS) patient with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
(ADEM)-like event in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
METHODS: Biological samples collected during the hospitalization were tested by 
serology and molecular diagnostic for various infectious agents. 
Histopathological analysis was performed using the anti-flavivirus group 4G2 
monoclonal antibody, anti-ZIKV non-structural 1 (NS1) monoclonal antibody, and 
anti-CD4, CD8, and CD11b antibodies.
RESULTS: Anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies were positive in the serum and urine. 
A brain biopsy showed ZIKV protein in brain cells and T CD8 infiltration in 
brain tissue.
CONCLUSION: Our data describe the coexistence of a recent central nervous system 
(CNS) ZIKV infection accompanied by a severe ADEM-like syndrome outcome in a 
patient with clinical history of MS. A de novo immune response concomitant with 
ZIKV infection might be involved in the mechanism of the ADEM-like syndrome and 
response to immunotherapy. The present report reinforces the importance of 
providing the differential diagnosis of acute episodes of MS exacerbation in an 
environment prone to ZIKV expression.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between serum levels of S100A8/A9 and 
S100A12 and the maintenance of clinically inactive disease during anti-tumor 
necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy and the occurrence of disease flare following 
withdrawal of anti-TNF therapy in patients with polyarticular forms of juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter study, 137 patients with 
polyarticular-course JIA whose disease was clinically inactive while receiving 
anti-TNF therapy were enrolled. Patients were observed for an initial 6-month 
phase during which anti-TNF treatment was continued. For those patients who 
maintained clinically inactive disease over the 6 months, anti-TNF was withdrawn 
and they were followed up for 8 months to assess for the occurrence of flare. 
Serum S100 levels were measured at baseline and at the time of anti-TNF 
withdrawal. Spearman's rank correlation test, Mann-Whitney U test, 
Kruskal-Wallis test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and 
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to assess the relationship between 
serum S100 levels and maintenance of clinically inactive disease and occurrence 
of disease flare after anti-TNF withdrawal.
RESULTS: Over the 6-month initial phase with anti-TNF therapy, the disease state 
reverted from clinically inactive to clinically active in 24 (18%) of the 130 
evaluable patients with polyarticular-course JIA; following anti-TNF withdrawal, 
39 (37%) of the 106 evaluable patients experienced a flare. Serum levels of 
S100A8/A9 and S100A12 were elevated in up to 45% of patients. Results of the ROC 
analysis revealed that serum S100 levels did not predict maintenance of 
clinically inactive disease during anti-TNF therapy nor did they predict disease 
flare after treatment withdrawal. Elevated levels of S100A8/A9 were not 
predictive of the occurrence of a disease flare within 30 days, 60 days, 90 
days, or 8 months following anti-TNF withdrawal, and elevated S100A12 levels had 
a modest predictive ability for determining the risk of flare within 30, 60, and 
90 days after treatment withdrawal. Serum S100A12 levels at the time of anti-TNF 
withdrawal were inversely correlated with the time to disease flare (r = -0.36).
CONCLUSION: Serum S100 levels did not predict maintenance of clinically inactive 
disease or occurrence of disease flare in patients with polyarticular-course 
JIA, and S100A12 levels were only moderately, and inversely, correlated with the 
time to disease flare.

OBJECTIVE: A prior study showed that premature mortality among patients with 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to lupus nephritis (LN) persisted in the US 
between 1995 and 2006. The present study was undertaken to extend this analysis 
through 2014 to examine more recent trends, including key cause-specific 
mortality trends.
METHODS: Using the national registry of patients with ESRD, we identified all 
patients with incident ESRD due to LN between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 
2014, divided into four 5-year cohorts of ESRD onset by calendar year 
(1995-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014). We assessed mortality within each 
cohort. Temporal trends in all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality were 
examined, adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: We identified 20,974 individuals with incident ESRD due to LN from 1995 
through 2014. The mortality rate per 100 patient-years declined from 11.1 (95% 
confidence interval [95% CI] 10.4-11.8) in 1995-1999 to 6.7 (95% CI 6.2-7.2) in 
2010-2014 (P for trend < 0.01). Adjusted mortality hazard ratios in 2010-2014, 
compared with 1995-1999, were 0.68 (95% CI 0.58-0.78) for white patients, 0.67 
(95% CI 0.57-0.78) for African American patients, and 0.51 (95% CI 0.38-0.69) 
for Hispanic patients. Deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and infection 
declined by 44% and 63%, respectively, from 1995-1999 to 2010-2014 (P for trend 
< 0.01 for both).
CONCLUSION: In the more recent years of the period 1995-2014, there was a 
considerable reduction in all-cause mortality among white, African American, and 
Hispanic patients, with reduced risk of death from CVD and infection. 
Collectively, these trends provide an important benchmark of improving care in 
this high-risk population.

OBJECTIVE: End points currently used in lupus nephritis (LN) clinical trials 
lack uniformity and questionably reflect long-term kidney survival. This study 
was undertaken to identify short-term end points that predict long-term kidney 
outcomes for use in clinical trials.
METHODS: A database of 944 patients with LN was assembled from 3 clinical trials 
and 12 longitudinal cohorts. Variables from the first 12 months of treatment 
after diagnosis of active LN (prediction period) were assessed as potential 
predictors of long-term outcomes in a 36-month follow-up period. The long-term 
outcomes examined were new or progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), severe 
kidney injury (SKI), and the need for permanent renal replacement therapy (RRT). 
To predict the risk for each outcome, hazard index tools (HITs) were derived 
using multivariable analysis with Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Among 550 eligible subjects, 54 CKD, 55 SKI, and 22 RRT events 
occurred. Variables in the final CKD HIT were prediction-period CKD status, 
12-month proteinuria, and 12-month serum creatinine level. The SKI HIT variables 
included prediction-period CKD status, International Society of Nephrology 
(ISN)/Renal Pathology Society (RPS) class, 12-month proteinuria, 12-month serum 
creatinine level, race, and an interaction between ISN/RPS class and 12-month 
proteinuria. The RRT HIT included age at diagnosis, 12-month proteinuria, and 
12-month serum creatinine level. Each HIT validated well internally (c-indices 
0.84-0.92) and in an independent LN cohort (c-indices 0.89-0.92).
CONCLUSION: HITs, derived from short-term kidney responses to treatment, 
correlate with long-term kidney outcomes, and now must be validated as surrogate 
end points for LN clinical trials.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test multiparametric magnetic resonance 
imaging including blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging by T2* mapping, 
magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) by tomoelastography, and 
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for detecting nephropathy in patients with 
lupus nephritis (LN).
METHODS: Forty-one subjects (25 patients with LN and 16 age- and sex-matched 
healthy volunteers; LN: mean age, 47.3 ± 14.8 years; 22 female subjects; 
volunteers: mean age, 43.9 ± 11.6 years; 13 female subjects) were prospectively 
enrolled. The LN group was further divided into subgroups with normal (LN-nRF, 
GFR > 90 mL/min per 1.73 m) and compromised renal function (LN-cRF, GFR < 90 
mL/min per 1.73 m). All subjects were examined by multifrequency MRE, BOLD 
imaging, and DWI, yielding shear wave speed (SWS; in meter per second), T2* 
relaxation times (in millisecond), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; in 
millimeter square per second), respectively. Renal subregional analysis was 
performed for the medulla (ME), inner cortex (CoI), and outer cortex (CoO). 
Imaging markers were correlated to clinical parameters such as GFR and 
protein-to-urine creatinine ratio. Cutoffs and area under the receiver operating 
curve (AUROC) were computed to test diagnostic performances.
RESULTS: Compared with CoI and CoO, LN-nRF predominantly affects ME tissue (SWS: 
-7%, P < 0.01; T2*: +9%, P < 0.05; ADC: -5%, P = 0.27). Detection of LN-nRF was 
better with MRE compared with BOLD imaging and DWI (AUROC = 0.81, 0.76, not 
significant), whereas pairing MRE with T2* further increased diagnostic power 
(AUROC = 0.91). Disease progression was associated with reduction of SWS also in 
CoI (LN-nRF, 3.04 ± 0.38 m/s; LN-cRF, 2.60 ± 0.26 m/s; p = 0.013), allowing 
distinction of LN-nRF from LN-cRF (AUROC = 0.83). Diffusion-weighted imaging was 
only sensitive to LN-cRF in ME tissue (ADC, -12%; P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Lupus nephritis with normal renal function first arises in MRE and 
BOLD images within ME tissue, progressing to CoI tissue once renal function 
becomes impaired and diffusion of tissue water changes.

OBJECTIVE: Acute postprandial hyperglycemia (aPPHG) is often symptomatic and can 
be associated with behavioral changes such as impaired working memory and 
attention. However, there is little evidence of the impact of aPPHG on the daily 
lives of patients. The aim of this study was to explore the frequency and 
severity of aPPHG episodes and their impact on daily functioning in people with 
insulin-treated diabetes.
METHODS: Adults (n = 1200) with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) 
or 2 (T2DM), most of whom experienced aPPHG, were recruited to complete an 
online cross-sectional survey in the USA and UK. The survey captured 
self-reported severity and frequency of aPPHG episodes and included a newly 
developed questionnaire (aPPHG-Q) assessing the impact of aPPHG episodes on 
patients' daily lives. Data was analyzed separately according to diabetes type 
and country. Regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between 
severity or frequency and scores on the aPPHG-Q.
RESULTS: Between 70% and 86% of USA, and 87% and 88% of UK participants reported 
experiencing aPPHG episodes. Increasing frequency and severity of aPPHG episodes 
were associated with worse scores on the aPPHG-Q in patients with both T1DM and 
T2DM in both countries (p < .014) on all subscale scores (excluding the worry 
and concerns scores for T1DM in the UK), although the magnitude of the 
association was smaller for aPPHG frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased severity and frequency of aPPHG episodes in patients with 
insulin-treated diabetes is associated with greater burden and experience of 
symptoms, and can negatively impact daily functioning.

AIMS: To compare the time spent in specified glycaemic ranges in people with 
type 1 diabetes (T1D) during 5 consecutive days of moderate-intensity exercise 
while on either 100% or 75% of their usual insulin degludec (IDeg) dose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine participants with T1D (four women, mean age 32.1 ± 
9.0 years, body mass index 25.5 ± 3.8 kg/m2 , glycated haemoglobin 55 ± 7 
mmol/mol (7.2% ± 0.6%) on IDeg were enrolled in the trial. Three days before the 
first exercise period, participants were randomized to either 100% or 75% of 
their usual IDeg dose. Participants exercised on a cycle ergometer for 55 
minutes at a moderate intensity for 5 consecutive days. After a 4-week wash-out 
period, participants performed the last exercise period for 5 consecutive days 
with the alternate IDeg dose. Time spent in specified glycaemic ranges, area 
under the curve and numbers of hypoglycaemic events were compared for the 5 days 
on each treatment allocation using a paired Students' t test, Wilcoxon 
matched-pairs signed-rank test and two-way ANOVA.
RESULTS: Time spent in euglycaemia over 5 days was greater for the 75% IDeg dose 
versus the 100% IDeg dose (4008 ± 938 minutes vs. 3566 ± 856 minutes; P = 0.04). 
Numbers of hypoglycaemic events (P = 0.91) and time spent in hypoglycaemia (P = 
0.07) or hyperglycaemia (P = 0.38) was similar for both dosing schemes.
CONCLUSIONS: A 25% reduction in usual IDeg dose around regular exercise led to 
more time spent in euglycaemia, with small effects on time spent in hypo- and 
hyperglycaemia.

There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria for large-vessel 
vasculitides (LVV), including giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis 
(TAK). Currently, available classification criteria cannot be used for the 
diagnosis of GCA and TAK. Early diagnosis of these two diseases is quite 
challenging in clinical practice and may be accomplished only by combining the 
patient symptoms, physical examination findings, blood test results, imaging 
findings, and biopsy results, if available. Awareness of red flags which lead 
the clinician to investigate TAK in a young patient with persistent systemic 
inflammation is helpful for the early diagnosis. It should be noted that 
clinical presentation may be highly variable in a subgroup of GCA patients with 
predominant large-vessel involvement (LVI) and without prominent cranial 
symptoms. Imaging modalities are especially helpful for the diagnosis of this 
subgroup. Differential diagnosis between older patients with TAK and this 
subgroup of GCA patients presenting with LVI may be difficult. Various 
pathologies may mimic LVV either by causing systemic inflammation and 
constitutional symptoms, or by causing lumen narrowing with or without aneurysm 
formation in the aorta and its branches. Differential diagnosis of aortitis is 
crucial. Infectious aortitis including mycotic aneurysms due to septicemia or 
endocarditis, as well as causes such as syphilis and mycobacterial infections 
should always be excluded. On the other hand, the presence of non-infectious 
aortitis is not unique for TAK and GCA. It should be noted that aortitis, other 
large-vessel involvement or both, may occasionally be seen in various other 
autoimmune pathologies including ANCA-positive vasculitides, Behçet's disease, 
ankylosing spondylitis, sarcoidosis, and Sjögren's syndrome. Besides, aortitis 
may be idiopathic and isolated. Atherosclerosis should always be considered in 
the differential diagnosis of LVV. Other pathologies which may mimic LVV 
include, but not limited to, congenital causes of aortic coarctation and middle 
aortic syndrome, immunoglobulin G4-related disease, and hereditary disorders of 
connective tissue such as Marfan syndrome and Ehler-Danlos syndrome.

The immunoproteasome is expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and is 
induced during inflammation by IFN-γ. Targeting the immunoproteasome with 
selective inhibitors has been shown to be therapeutically effective in 
pre-clinical models for autoimmune diseases, colitis-associated cancer 
formation, and transplantation. Immunoproteasome inhibition prevents activation 
and proliferation of lymphocytes, lowers MHC class I cell surface expression, 
reduces the expression of cytokines of activated immune cells, and curtails  T 
helper 1 and 17 cell differentiation. This might explain the in vivo efficacy of 
immunoproteasome inhibition in different pre-clinical disease models for 
autoimmunity, cancer, and transplantation. In this review, we summarize the 
effect of immunoproteasome inhibition in different animal models for 
transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: Persistent systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity is 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In a multicenter cohort of 
patients with prevalent SLE, we described persistence, patterns, and predictors 
of change in disease activity over time.
METHODS: Based on SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)-2K scores at cohort entry, 
patients were classified into 4 groups: low (score < 4; LOW), moderate (4 to < 
6; MOD), moderately high (6 to ≤ 10; MHIGH), and very high (> 10; VHIGH). 
Multivariable linear and longitudinal mixed linear regression models were used 
to identify predictors of change over time in SLEDAI-2K.
RESULTS: There were 2019 participants, with declining followup data over 5 years 
(1326, 580, 274, 186, and 148 patients, respectively). At cohort entry, mean (± 
SD) age was 42 (± 17) years, disease duration 11 (± 10) years, and 90% were 
female. The 4 groups included 44% LOW (n = 891), 20% MOD (n = 400), 22% MHIGH (n 
= 442), and 14% VHIGH (n = 286); therefore, 36% had clinically important SLE 
activity. The proportion of patients in the LOW group at entry who moved to a 
higher activity level varied from 30% (167/557) at 1 year, to 49% (41/83) at 3 
years, and 54% (30/56) at 5 years. Among 181 patients with MOD to VHIGH entry 
activity and 3 years of followup, 116 (64.1%) remained active. In all analyses, 
only higher SLEDAI-2K at cohort entry remained a significant predictor of higher 
SLEDAI-2K in subsequent years.
CONCLUSION: Higher SLEDAI-2K at study entry was the single major independent 
predictor of higher SLEDAI-2K over time, reflecting frequent persistence of 
active disease, even in patients with longstanding disease. This highlights gaps 
in the optimal treatment of SLE.

BACKGROUND: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is used for treatment of cholestatic 
liver diseases and may improve long-term outcome. Although treatment with this 
hydrophilic bile acid is virtually without side effects, medication adherence 
might be suboptimal due to patient misconceptions, compromising clinical 
outcome. Our aim was to evaluate adherence to UDCA in relation to patient 
beliefs about medicine and to identify potential predictors of poor adherence.
METHODS: Prospective open-label study recruiting patients in treatment with UDCA 
from April 2016 to March 2017. Adherence was assessed both by the Sensemedic 
dispenser and by patient-reported adherence, during 12 weeks. Good adherence was 
defined as ≥ 80% intake. Quality of life (by SF-36) and beliefs about medicine 
(by BMQ) were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 75 patients were enrolled (32% primary biliary cholangitis, 
31% autoimmune hepatitis, 29% primary sclerosing cholangitis and 8% other 
conditions). Average adherence according to the medication dispenser was 
92 ± 16% (range: 17-100). Eighty-nine percent of the patients exhibited good 
adherence and 11% poor adherence. According to the BMQ, 42% of all patients were 
accepting, 50% ambivalent, 8% indifferent and 0% skeptical to UDCA treatment. 
Poor adherence was associated with young age (P = 0.029) and male gender 
(P = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the excellent safety profile of UDCA, still a significant 
number of patients are poorly adherent. Young age and male sex are associated 
with poor adherence. Efforts should be made to identify patients with poor 
adherence and to improve their compliance to therapy.

We investigated whether albumin to globulin ratio (AGR) at diagnosis may be 
associated with all-cause mortality in immunosuppressive drug-naïve patients 
with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). We retrospectively reviewed the medical 
records of 88 MPA patients, who were first classified and in whom medications 
was first initiated in our tertiary Hospital. We collected clinical and 
laboratory data as well as the rate of all-cause mortality. AGR at diagnosis was 
calculated as a ratio of serum albumin over globulin fraction (protein-albumin). 
We compared variables between survived and deceased patients. The multivariable 
Cox hazard model was conducted to appropriately obtain the hazard ratios (HRs). 
The mean age at diagnosis was 56.3 years and 24 patients (27.3%) were men. Seven 
patients died for the mean follow-up period of 49.7 months. Deceased patients 
were elder than survived patients (P = 0.048). Five factor score (FFS) (2009) 
(P = 0.001), creatinine (P = 0.026) and AGR (P = 0.007) at diagnosis in deceased 
patients were higher than those in the survived. In the multivariable Cox hazard 
model analysis, only AGR at diagnosis (HR 0.004) was inversely associated with 
all-cause mortality during the follow-up. Furthermore, when the cutoff of AGR 
for death was set as 0.88, patients with AGR ≤ 0.88 exhibited the lower 
cumulative patients survival rate than those with AGR > 0.88 (P = 0.006). Among 
the conventional and MPA-related risk factors for mortality, AGR at diagnosis is 
inversely associated with all-cause mortality during follow-up in MPA patients.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe complication and leading cause 
of mortality in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). This study was 
to investigate the overall survival rates and the utility of red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW) as a potential prognostic factor of pSS-PAH. This 
cohort study retrospectively enrolled 55 patients with pSS-PAH who were followed 
up at the Department of Rheumatology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital 
(PUMCH) between August 2007 and May 2017. The patients were stratified according 
to the level of RDW (≤ 15.0 and > 15.0%). Baseline demographics, laboratory 
results, pulmonary function conditions, hemodynamic assessments, and treatment 
regimens were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to 
identify whether RDW level is a factor related to adverse outcome. A total of 55 
patients were recruited, with an average age of 38.9 ± 9.3 years. Fifty-four 
were female (98.2%), and the average duration at the time of PAH diagnosis was 
25.5 ± 33.2 months. Higher RDW levels were found in patients who deceased in 
follow-up (13.8 ± 2.6 vs 16.5 ± 1.6%, p = 0.003) and with higher NYHA classes 
(13.8 ± 1.8 vs 16.5 ± 2.9%, p < 0.001). Patients with RDW > 15% had a 
significantly worse overall survival than patients with RDW ≤ 15% (3-year 
survival rate 59.5 vs. 88.7% log-rank p = 0.015). Cox regression analysis 
identified RDW > 15% as a prognostic factor for adverse outcome (HR 1.786, 95% 
CI 1.137-2.803, p = 0.012). RDW can serve as a potential negative prognostic 
factor of pSS-PAH.

Splenic artery aneurysm with systemic lupus erythematosus is rare but serious. 
We report a case of a 45-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus who 
presented with a splenic artery aneurysm of anomalous origin from the superior 
mesenteric artery. This is the first time to report about using an endovascular 
approach to treat splenic artery aneurysm combined with systemic lupus 
erythematosus. Endovascular repair of the aneurysm was conducted using a covered 
stent and multiple coils to exclude both the aneurysm and total splenic artery 
embolization for treating thrombocytopenia, and this approach was determined to 
be safe and effective for yielding short-term results.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate outcomes after lower extremity revascularization for 
critical limb ischemia with tissue loss in patients with chronic immune-mediated 
inflammatory disease.
METHODS: A retrospective medical record review of all lower extremity 
revascularization for critical limb ischemia with tissue loss at a 
university-affiliated hospital over a 3-year period was completed for 
demographics, comorbidities, lower extremity revascularization indication, 
angiogram results, complications, mortality, limb salvage, and reintervention. 
Chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease (CIID) and control (no autoimmune 
disease) were compared by chi-squared test, Student's t-test, Kaplan-Meier, and 
Cox Regression.
RESULTS: There were 349 procedures performed (297 patients): (1) 44 (13%) 
primary amputations and (2) 305 (87%) lower extremity revascularizations, in 
which 83% were endovascular interventions; 12% was bypass; and 5% was hybrid, in 
which 40% was infrainguinal and 60% was infrageniculate, 72% Wounds Ischemia 
Infection Score System (WIFi) tissue loss class 2-3, 35% CIID. No differences 
were noted between CIID and control for primary amputation (P = 0.11), lower 
extremity revascularization type (P = 0.50), or lower extremity 
revascularization anatomic level (P = 0.43). Mean age was 71 + 13 years, and 56% 
of the patients were of male gender. Those with CIID were of similar age as 
controls (71 ± 14 vs. 71 ± 13; P = 0.87) and presented with comparable runoff: 
(1) ≤1 vessel (52% vs. 47%; P = 0.67), (2) WIFi tissue loss classification class 
2-3 (66% vs. 76%; P = 0.09), and (3) WIFi infection classification class 2-3 
(29% vs. 30%; P = 0.9). They were also less likely to be male (47% vs. 61%; 
P = 0.022) or current smokers (13% vs. 27%; P = 0.008). Postoperative mortality 
(P = 0.70) morbidity and reoperation (0.31) were comparable. Twenty-four-month 
survival was similar for CIID and control (83% ± 5% vs. 86% + 3%; P = 0.78), as 
was the amputation-free interval (69% ± 5% vs. 61% ± 4%; P = 0.18) and need for 
target extremity revascularization (40% vs. 53%; P = 0.04). Use of steroids and 
other anti-inflammatory medications was associated with improved 24-month 
amputation-free interval (87% ± 9% vs. 63% ± 3%; P = 0. 05). Dialysis (odds 
ratio: 2.6; 1.5-4.7; P = 0.001), WIFi infection class 2-3 (odds ratio: 2.8; 
1.6-4.9; P < 0.001), prerunoff vessel (0-1 vs. 2-3) to the foot (odds ratio: 
0.52; 0.37-0.73; P < 0.001), steroids/other anti-inflammatory agents (0.29; 
0.06-0.96; P = 0.04), and statins (0.44; 0.25-0.77; P = 0.005) were independent 
predictors of 24-month amputation-free interval (Cox proportional hazard ratio).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with critical limb ischemia, tissue loss, and concomitant 
CIID can be successfully treated with lower extremity revascularization with 
similar limb salvage and need for reintervention. Steroid/anti-inflammatory use 
appears beneficial.

BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune bullous 
disease. Whether there is an increased risk for subsequent BP among patients 
with cancer is still unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk for subsequent BP in patients with cancer.
METHODS: This nationwide population-based cohort study was based on data 
obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database between 2000 and 
2011. A total of 36 838 patients with cancer and 147 352 age-, sex- and 
index-date-matched controls were recruited. The hazard ratio (HR) of subsequent 
BP in the patients with cancer was analysed using a Fine-Gray competing risk 
regression model with mortality as the competing event.
RESULTS: The incidence of BP per 100 000 person-years was 17·2 in the patients 
with cancer and 19·8 in the controls; therefore, the crude incidence rate ratio 
was 0·87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·53-1·36]. The HR of subsequent BP in 
the patients with cancer was 0·47 (95% CI 0·23-0·94) using the Fine-Gray 
competing risk regression model. Age (HR 1·05, 95% CI 1·03-1·07), diabetes 
mellitus (HR 1·69, 95% CI 1·10-2·59) and cerebrovascular disease (HR 2·14, 95% 
CI 1·36-3·34) were independent risk factors for BP.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of BP in patients with cancer was not higher than in 
the control group. Cancer is not a risk factor for BP.

Insulin-like Growth Factor-I Receptor and Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy.

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a complex disease process presumed to 
emerge from autoimmunity occurring in the thyroid gland, most frequently in 
Graves disease (GD). It is disfiguring and potentially blinding, culminating in 
orbital tissue remodeling and disruption of function of structures adjacent to 
the eye. There are currently no medical therapies proven capable of altering the 
clinical outcome of TAO in randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trials. 
The orbital fibroblast represents the central target for immune reactivity. 
Recent identification of fibroblasts that putatively originate in the bone 
marrow as monocyte progenitors provides a plausible explanation for why 
antigens, the expressions of which were once considered restricted to the 
thyroid, are detected in the TAO orbit. These cells, known as fibrocytes, 
express relatively high levels of functional TSH receptor (TSHR) through which 
they can be activated by TSH and the GD-specific pathogenic antibodies that 
underpin thyroid overactivity. Fibrocytes also express insulin-like growth 
factor I receptor (IGF-IR) with which TSHR forms a physical and functional 
signaling complex. Notably, inhibition of IGF-IR activity results in the 
attenuation of signaling initiated at either receptor. Some studies suggest that 
IGF-IR-activating antibodies are generated in GD, whereas others refute this 
concept. These observations served as the rationale for implementing a recently 
completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a monoclonal inhibitory antibody 
targeting IGF-IR in TAO. Results of that trial in active, moderate to severe 
disease revealed dramatic and rapid reductions in disease activity and severity. 
The targeting of IGF-IR with specific biologic agents may represent a paradigm 
shift in the therapy of TAO.

condition of adalimumab (ADA)-treated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in a 
real-world setting. Methods ADA was used in the treatment of 130 (male, n=21; 
female, n=109 females) RA patients. Among them, 26 patients (20.0%) discontinued 
ADA due to a good response. We analyzed 20 patients who were followed up for 
more than 6 months after the discontinuation of ADA. The Disease Activity Score 
28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) and modified health assessment 
questionnaires (mHAQs) were evaluated. Results The mean age of the patients was 
53.4±11.1 years. The mean disease duration was 4.5±4.3 years. Sixteen patients 
were bDMARD-naïve, while 4 switched from bDMARDs to ADA. At 6 months after the 
discontinuation ADA, 19 patients had achieved a clinical remission, and 1 had 
achieved a low disease activity. The Bio-free period was 26.4±15.5 months. The 
dose of prednisolone was significantly reduced from baseline (3.45±3.17 mg/day) 
at 6 months after the discontinuation of ADA (2.63±2.78 mg/day). The dose of 
methotrexate was unchanged. The number of conventional synthetic DMARDs 
(csDMARDs) was significantly increased (0.8±0.6 to 1.4±1.06). The mHAQ values 
were significantly ameliorated by ADA and remained good in patients with a 
Bio-free condition. A multivariate analysis showed that the dose of methotrexate 
(MTX) was an important factor for achieving a Bio-free condition. Conclusion A 
sustainable Bio-free condition in a real clinical setting can be achieved and 
may be a suitable way of reducing medical costs. The dose of MTX and the 
additional administration of csDMARDs is therefore thought to be important for 
ensuring a good outcome in these patients.

Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) T-cell type infection, systemic form, 
is characterized by persistent infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms, high 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA levels in the peripheral blood, organ damage, and a 
poor prognosis. The association between CAEBV and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is 
unclear. We report a case of fatal CAEBV T-cell type infection in an RA patient 
undergoing treatment with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 
immunoglobulin fusion protein (abatacept, ABT). CAEBV can rapidly worsen in RA 
patients receiving ABT. Thus, we should try to establish an early diagnosis in 
patients with CAEBV infection.

Center, Boston, Massachusetts.

Hypertension and dyslipidemia are often suboptimally managed in teens with type 
1 diabetes (T1D). Teen and parent perspectives on hypertension and dyslipidemia 
management need further study to enhance the development of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risk factor management plans. We sought to describe barriers to 
and strategies for CVD risk factor management. Teens with T1D with and without 
dyslipidemia and parents of teens with T1D with and without dyslipidemia 
underwent one-on-one semi-structured interviews conducted by trained personnel 
at a diabetes center; interviews continued until thematic saturation was 
reached. Teens and parents of teens described their knowledge, attitudes, and 
beliefs regarding heart health and CVD risk factors (hypertension and 
dyslipidemia). Researchers undertook a content analysis and categorized central 
themes as strategies and barriers. In total, 22 teens and 25 parents completed 
interviews. Teens were 17.4 ± 1.7 years old with T1D duration 9.7 ± 4.0 years; 
45% had dyslipidemia. Parents were between 41 and 60 years old, 84% were 
mothers, and 40% had teens with dyslipidemia. Barriers to heart health included 
an obesity-promoting environment, parental distrust of medications, and limited 
teen knowledge about hypertension and dyslipidemia. Strategies included specific 
and realistic guidance from providers, family support of teen lifestyle 
management, and having exercise partners. While teen and parent perspectives 
were often similar, some themes applied only to teens or parents. Central themes 
provide actionable guidance to enhance hypertension and dyslipidemia management. 
Providers should consider teen and parent perspectives when managing CVD risk 
factors to enhance engagement with CVD risk management.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation accompanies many central nervous system 
(CNS) diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), and is strongly dependent on 
the purinergic P2X7 receptor. The nature of the inflammatory response in MS is 
studied for decades indicating, that proinflammatory microgliosis is involved in 
advanced stages of MS and is associated with active tissue damage and 
neurological dysfunctions. Evidence on the role of microgliosis in initial 
stages of the disease is scarce. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the 
time course of microglial activation in rat brain subjected to experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) which is the animal model of MS. We show that 
activation of microglia occurs in brains of immunized rats at a very early stage 
of EAE, well before the development of neurological symptoms of the disease. 
Enhanced immunoreactivity of microglia/macrophage-specific protein Iba-1, 
together with morphological features of microgliosis, was identified beginning 
at day 4 post immunization. Concomitantly, microglial expression of P2X7R was 
also examined. Moreover, our results reveal that administration of Brilliant 
Blue G, an antagonist of P2X7R, delays the onset of the disease and partially 
inhibits development of neurological symptoms in EAE rats. Blockage of P2X7R 
significantly reduces activation of microglia as confirmed by decreased Iba-1 
immunoreactivity and suppresses neuroinflammation in EAE rat brains, as 
indicated by decreased protein levels of investigated proinflammatory cytokines: 
IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Our results indicate that microglia are involved in 
inducing neuroinflammation at a very early stage of MS/EAE via a P2X7R-dependent 
mechanism.

Increasing evidence shows miR-155 plays an important role in regulating 
inflammatory processes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in 
lupus nephritis (LN). Because the chemokine CXCL13 is implicated in the 
pathogenesis of LN, here we examined whether miR-155 can modulate the activity 
of CXCL13 or its receptor CXCR5. We determined the expression of CXCL13 in 
normal and MRL/lpr mice and found elevated levels of CXCL13 in the kidneys of 
MRL/lpr mice compared with normal kidneys. Besides, CXCL13 expression was mainly 
detected in the glomerulus, specifically to mesangial areas. We then transfected 
a miR-155 mimic in human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) to overexpress miR-155 
and detected decreased protein levels of CXCR5 by western blot analysis. 
Transfection of the miR-155 mimic into CXCL13-treated HRMCs resulted in a 
significantly reduced proliferation rate of HRMCs as measured by the 
cell-counting assay and flow cytometry. Moreover, increased intracellular 
miR-155 also led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK and TGF-β1 production. 
Together, these results revealed that miR-155 may play a role in the 
pathogenesis of LN.

Multiple nutritional factors and thyroid disease, with particular reference to 
autoimmune thyroid disease.

Sciences,University of Surrey,Guildford GU2 7XH,UK.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' disease (GD) are examples of autoimmune 
thyroid disease (AITD), the commonest autoimmune condition. Antibodies to 
thyroid peroxidase (TPO), the enzyme that catalyses thyroid-hormone production 
and antibodies to the receptor for the thyroid-stimulating hormone, are 
characteristic of HT and GD, respectively. It is presently accepted that genetic 
susceptibility, environmental factors, including nutritional factors and immune 
disorders contribute to the development of AITD. Aiming to investigate the 
effect of iodine, iron and selenium in the risk, pathogenesis and treatment of 
thyroid disease, PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant 
publications to provide a narrative review. Iodine: chronic exposure to excess 
iodine intake induces autoimmune thyroiditis, partly because highly-iodinated 
thyroglobulin (Tg) is more immunogenic. The recent introduction of universal 
salt iodisation can have a similar, although transient, effect. Iron: iron 
deficiency impairs thyroid metabolism. TPO is a haem enzyme that becomes active 
only after binding haem. AITD patients are frequently iron-deficient since 
autoimmune gastritis, which reduces iron absorption and coeliac disease which 
causes iron loss, are frequent co-morbidities. In two-thirds of women with 
persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism despite appropriate levothyroxine therapy, 
restoration of serum ferritin above 100 µg/l ameliorated symptoms. Selenium: 
selenoproteins are essential to thyroid action. In particular, the glutathione 
peroxidases remove excessive hydrogen peroxide produced there for the iodination 
of Tg to form thyroid hormones. There is evidence from observational studies and 
randomised controlled trials that selenium, probably as selenoproteins, can 
reduce TPO-antibody concentration, hypothyroidism and postpartum thyroiditis. 
Appropriate status of iodine, iron and selenium is crucial to thyroid health.

Microglia are innate immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), that 
supplies neurons with key factors for executing autophagosomal/lysosomal 
functions. Macroautophagy/autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that 
maintains cell balance in response to stress-related stimulation. Abnormal 
autophagy occurs with many pathologies, such as cancer, and autoimmune and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, clarification of the mechanisms of autophagy 
regulation is of utmost importance. Recently, researchers presented microRNAs 
(miRNAs) as novel and potent modulators of autophagic activity. Here, we found 
that Mir223 deficiency significantly ameliorated CNS inflammation, demyelination 
and the clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and 
increased resting microglia and autophagy in brain microglial cells. In 
contrast, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methylademine (3-MA) aggravated the clinical 
symptoms of EAE in wild-type (WT) and Mir223-deficienct mice. Furthermore, it 
was confirmed that Mir223 deficiency in mice increased the protein expression of 
ATG16L1 (autophagy related 16-like 1 [S. cerevisiae]) and LC3-II in bone 
marrow-derived macrophage cells compared with cells from WT mice. Indeed, the 
cellular level of Atg16l1 was decreased in BV2 cells upon Mir223 overexpression 
and increased following the introduction of antagomirs. We also showed that the 
3' UTR of Atg16l1 contained functional Mir223-responsive sequences and that 
overexpression of ATG16L1 returned autophagy to normal levels even in the 
presence of Mir223 mimics. Collectively, these data indicate that Mir223 is a 
novel and important regulator of autophagy and that Atg16l1 is a Mir223 target 
in this process, which may have implications for improving our understanding of 
the neuroinflammatory process of EAE. Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methylademine;

Adipose tissue, an endocrine organ, secretes bioactive factors including 
adiponectin. Adiponectin is a protein hormone that enhances insulin sensitivity 
through increased fatty acid oxidation and inhibition of hepatic glucose 
production. We assessed the association of the adiponectin promoter region 
polymorphisms -11391 G/A and -11377 C/G with susceptibility to type 1 (T1DM) and 
type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus in the population of west Iran. Also, we 
investigated the effect of adiponectin level and lipid profile on T1DM and T2DM 
development. In this case-control study, we recruited 189 patients with diabetes 
(100 T2DM and 89 T1DM) and 161 sex and age-matched unrelated healthy controls. 
Adiponectin mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and the protein level was measured by 
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Other biochemical parameters were 
determined by routine laboratory methods. The G allele of adiponectin gene at 
-11377 position (C/G) significantly increased the risk of T1DM. With respect to 
genotype models, codominant (2.97 times), dominant (3.6-fold), and 
over-codominant (2.9-fold) patients with T1DM who carried -11377 C > G 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly susceptible to the 
development of the disease. A significantly higher level of adiponectin in T1DM 
was oberved compared with the control group. In contrast, patients with T2DM had 
lower adiponectin levels compared with healthy controls. The genotype 
distributions of -11391 G/A polymorphisms were the same for patients with 
diabetes and control groups. The presence of G allele at -11377 C/G adiponectin 
gene significantly increased serum adiponectin level and may be a risk factor 
for T1DM susceptibility among the western Iranian population.

Autoantibodies against dsDNA are utilized for the diagnosis and prognosis of SLE 
as they are highly specific and correlate with disease activity/renal 
involvement. However, different detection methods are used in routine diagnostic 
laboratories. Farr radioimmunoassay (Farr-RIA) has been designated as the 
preferred method, since it provides very specific and at the same time 
quantitative results, enabling follow-up of level variations over time. Using 
intercalating fluorescent dsDNA dye would enable all the benefits of Farr-RIA 
without the radioactive material and organic solvents. To develop a modified 
fluorescent Farr method (Farr-FIA) and compare it to the classical Farr-RIA in 
regard to laboratory parameters, as well as clinical utility. Assays were tested 
on sera of 70 SLE patients, 78 other autoimmune patients, and 145 healthy blood 
donors. DNA for Farr-FIA was isolated from healthy donor, for Farr-RIA, 
14C-labeled dsDNA from E. coli was used and mixed with sera in borate-buffered 
saline, followed by precipitation with saturated ammonium sulfate solution and 
centrifugation. The supernatant (S) was separated from the precipitate (P), and 
content of dsDNA was measured with PicoGreen (Invitrogen) in Farr-FIA or 
radioactive isotope in scintillation solution in Farr-RIA. The results were 
calculated as a ratio (P-S)/(P+S). Farr-FIA has a diagnostic sensitivity of 53% 
and diagnostic specificity of 100% (ROC AUC 0.781). Good correlation and 
agreement were shown between Farr-RIA and Farr-FIA. Also, there is good 
correlation between Farr-FIA and SLEDAI, comparable to that of Farr-RIA. 
Farr-FIA differs from Farr-RIA in the changed detection system yielding 
comparable results and thus could represent a nonradioactive replacement for 
Farr-RIA.

PURPOSE: Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM), characterized by rapid and 
almost complete destruction of pancreatic β-cells, is a newly identified subtype 
of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although, the pathophysiology of this condition 
remains still unclear, histological evidence suggests that not only β-cells but 
also α-cells of pancreatic islets are reduced in number in FT1DM. However, the 
ability of glucagon secretion in patients with this condition has remained 
largely uncharacterized. We therefore examined glucagon secretion in patients 
with FT1DM and compared that with patients with other types of diabetes 
mellitus.
METHODS: Fasting glucagon levels as well as glucagon secretion induced by 
intravenous administration of arginine were measured in hospitalized 83 patients 
with diabetes mellitus, including 4 with FT1DM, 18 with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM), 40 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 5 with slowly progressive 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (SPIDDM), and 16 with pancreatic diabetes 
mellitus (PDM).
RESULTS: The area under the curve for serum glucagon levels after arginine 
infusion in FT1DM patients was significantly smaller than that in T1DM, T2DM, or 
SPIDDM patients but was similar to that in PDM patients. The fasting serum 
glucagon level of FT1DM patients was lower than that of T1DM or T2DM patients 
but did not significantly differ from that of SPIDDM or PDM patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that glucagon secretion is impaired in 
patients with FT1DM.

AIM: Several biomarkers have been proposed to detect pancreatic β cell 
destruction in vivo but so far have not been compared for sensitivity and 
significance.
METHODS: We used islet transplantation as a model to compare plasma 
concentrations of miR-375, 65-kDa subunit of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65), 
and unmethylated insulin DNA, measured at subpicomolar sensitivity, and study 
their discharge kinetics, power for outcome prediction, and detection of graft 
loss during follow-up.
RESULTS: At 60 minutes after transplantation, GAD65 and miR-375 consistently 
showed near-equimolar and correlated increases proportional to the number of 
implanted β cells. GAD65 and miR-375 showed comparable power to predict poor 
graft outcome at 2 months, with areas under the curve of 0.833 and 0.771, 
respectively (P = 0.53). Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, we 
defined likelihood ratios (LRs) for rationally selected result intervals. In 
GADA-negative recipients (n = 28), GAD65 <4.5 pmol/L (LR = 0.15) and >12.2 
pmol/L (LR = ∞) predicted good and poor outcomes, respectively. miR-375 could be 
used in all recipients irrespective of GAD65 autoantibody status (n = 46), with 
levels <1.4 pmol/L (LR = 0.14) or >7.6 pmol/L (LR = 9.53) as dual thresholds. 
The posttransplant surge of unmethylated insulin DNA was inconsistent and 
unrelated to outcome. Combined measurement of these three biomarkers was also 
tested as liquid biopsy for β cell death during 2-month follow-up; incidental 
surges of GAD65, miR-375, and (un)methylated insulin DNA, alone or combined, 
were confidently detected but could not be related to outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: GAD65 and miR-375 performed equally well in quantifying early graft 
destruction and predicting graft outcome, outperforming unmethylated insulin 
DNA.

BACKGROUND: Patient-driven innovation in diabetes management has resulted in a 
group of people with type 1 diabetes who choose to build and share knowledge 
around a do-it-yourself (DIY) open source artificial pancreas systems (OpenAPS). 
The purpose of this study was to examine Twitter data to understand how 
patients, caregivers, and care partners perceive OpenAPS, the personal and 
emotional ramifications of using OpenAPS, and the influence of OpenAPS on daily 
life.
METHODS: Qualitative netnography was used to analyze #OpenAPS on Twitter over a 
two-year period.
RESULTS: There were 328 patients, caregivers, and care partners who generated 
3347 tweets. One overarching theme, OpenAPS changes lives, and five subthemes 
emerged from the data: (1) OpenAPS use suggests self-reported A1C and glucose 
variability improvement, (2) OpenAPS improves sense of diabetes burden and 
quality of life, (3) OpenAPS is perceived as safe, (4) 
patient/caregiver-provider interaction related to OpenAPS, and (5) technology 
adaptation for user needs.
CONCLUSIONS: As users of a patient-driven technology, OpenAPS users are 
self-reporting improved A1C, day-to-day glucose levels, and quality of life. 
Safety features important to individuals with diabetes are perceived to be 
embedded into OpenAPS technology. Twitter analysis provides insight on a patient 
population driving an innovative solution to improve their quality of diabetes 
care.

BACKGROUND: The perceived value and consistent use of continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM) systems depends in part on their accuracy. We assessed the 
performance of a sixth-generation CGM system (Dexcom G6) in children and 
adolescents.
METHODS: Forty-nine participants (6-17 years of age, mean ± SD of 13.5 ± 3.3 
years), all with type 1 diabetes, enrolled and data were available from 37. Each 
participant wore 1 sensor for up to 10 days and was asked to undergo an 
in-clinic visit lasting 6-12 hours for frequent blood glucose (BG) sample 
testing on one of the sensor wear days. Estimated glucose values (EGVs) from the 
G6 system were compared with venous BG values measured with a laboratory 
reference instrument (YSI).
RESULTS: The overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for 1387 EGV-YSI 
pairs was 7.7%, and the overall percentage of EGVs within 20% or 20 mg/dL of the 
YSI reference value (for YSI > or ⩽100 mg/dL, respectively, the "%20/20") was 
96.2%. The %20/20 was 92.1% on Day 1 and 91.0% on Day 10 of sensor wear. For 
EGVs <70 mg/dL, 92.6% of the YSI values were within 20 mg/dL and for EGVs >250 
mg/dL, 100% of the YSI values were within 20%. Differences between EGVs and YSI 
values in over 99.9% of the pairs posed no or only slight clinical risk as 
evaluated by surveillance error grid analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the G6 CGM system in pediatrics may encourage 
consistent use of the system and contribute to improved glycemic outcomes in 
this population.

We describe the use of radiotherapy for parotid IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), 
initially misdiagnosed as Kimura's disease, with sustained good partial response 
in a 37-year-old male. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported 
case of radiation for extra-orbital IgG4-RD, albeit inadvertently.

OBJECTIVE: Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) is a multi-transmembrane protein situated 
in the insulin secretory granule of the islets of β-cells and is identified as a 
novel auto-antigen in type 1 diabetes (T1D). The gene coding for ZnT8, solute 
carrier family 30 member 8 (SLC30A8) is located on chromosome 8q24.11. This 
study aimed to identify the association of SLC30A8 rs13266634 C/T gene 
polymorphism with T1D in a sample of T1D children in Tamil Nadu, India.
METHODS: The family based study was conducted in 121 T1D patients and 214 of 
their family members as controls. The SLC30A8 gene rs13266634 C/T polymorphism 
was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in either allele (odds ratio: 
0.92; confidence interval: 0.33-2.58; p=0.88) and genotype (CC: p=0.74; CT: 
p=0.82; TT: p=0.80) frequencies of rs13266634 C/T between T1D patients and 
controls. Transmission disequilibrium test has identified over-transmission of 
mutant T allele from parents to affected children (T: U=9:7) without statistical 
significance. Metaanalysis on the overall effects of rs13266634 C allele 
frequency was not different (p=0.10 and Pheterogeneity=0.99) in T1D patients as 
compared to the controls.
CONCLUSION: The present study along with the meta-analysis does not show any 
substantial association of the rs13266634 C/T polymorphism with T1D development 
in this population.

To identify the effects of the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist 
aprepitant in treating pelvic pain, micturition symptoms, and bladder 
inflammation in mice with experimental autoimmune cystitis (EAC) similar to 
bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC). Female C57BL/6 mice were 
divided into the following three groups: normal control, EAC, and EAC plus 
aprepitant. EAC was induced in mice by duplicate immunization with bladder 
homogenate. In the EAC model group, EAC mice were given PBS by gavage once a day 
during the fourth week. In the EAC plus aprepitant group, aprepitant was 
administered instead of PBS in the same way. After 4 weeks, pelvic pain 
threshold and urination habits of mice were analyzed, as well as the bladder 
weight to body weight ratio, and histologic assessment of the expression of 
IL-1β, TNF-α, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and NK1R in bladder 
tissue. EAC mice mimicked the phenotype and pathophysiologic lesions of BPS/IC 
well. Compared to PBS-treated EAC mice, the mice treated with aprepitant 
exhibited higher pain threshold values, less number of total urine spots or 
small urine spots, lower bladder weight to body weight ratio, and reduced 
bladder inflammation with less mast cell infiltration and decreased expressions 
of IL-1β, TNF-α, and ICAM-1 in bladder tissue. There was no difference in NK1R 
expression in bladders treated with or without aprepitant. The NK1R antagonist 
aprepitant relieved pelvic pain, urinary symptoms, and bladder inflammation in 
EAC mice. This indicated that NK1R may be a novel therapeutic target in BPS/IC 
treatment.

OBJECTIVE: X linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a hereditary 
neuropathy caused by mutations in GJB1 coding for connexin-32, a gap junction 
protein expressed in Schwann cells, but also found in oligodendrocytes. Four 
patients with CMTX developing central nervous system (CNS) demyelination 
compatible with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been individually published. We 
presently sought to systematically investigate the relationship between CMTX and 
MS.
METHODS: Over 20 years, 70 consecutive patients (36 men) with GJB1 mutations 
were identified at our Neurogenetics Unit, Athens, Greece, and assessed for 
clinical features suggestive of MS. Additionally, 18 patients with CMTX without 
CNS symptoms and 18 matched controls underwent brain MRI to investigate 
incidental findings. Serum from patients with CMTX and MS was tested for CNS 
immunoreactivity.
RESULTS: We identified three patients with CMTX who developed clinical features 
suggestive of inflammatory CNS demyelination fulfilling MS diagnostic criteria. 
The resulting 20-year MS incidence (4.3%) differed significantly from the 
highest background 20-year MS incidence ever reported from Greece (p=0.00039). 
The search for incidental brain MRI findings identified two CMTX cases (11%) 
with lesions suggestive of focal demyelination compared with 0 control. 
Moreover, 10 cases in the CMTX cohort had hyperintensity in the splenium of the 
corpus callosum compared with 0 control (p=0.0002). No specific CNS-reactive 
humoral factors were identified in patients with CMTX and MS.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a higher than expected frequency of MS in 
patients with CMTX and identified incidental focal demyelinating lesions on 
brain MRI in patients with CMTX without CNS symptoms. This provides 
circumstantial evidence for GJB1 mutations acting as a possible MS risk factor.

INTRODUCTION: The dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) detects lupus 
anticoagulant (LA). International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) 
guidelines specify positivity criteria, which differ from the assay 
manufacturer's criteria.
METHODS: Two years of dRVVT testing at our institution were reviewed. For 
patients with prolonged dRVVT screening times, we evaluated dRVVT results by 
ISTH and manufacturer's criteria and correlated with the results of other 
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) testing (LA-sensitive activated partial 
thromboplastin time and antiphospholipid antibodies) and with history of 
thromboembolism and other APS manifestations.
RESULTS: Approximately one-fifth of dRVVTs exhibited a prolonged screening time. 
Among first prolonged dRVVTs, 35% were positive by both ISTH and manufacturer 
criteria, 44% met neither criteria, and 20% were equivocal (positive by only 
ISTH or manufacturer). Positivity by ISTH guidelines alone correlated better 
with other positive APS tests than manufacturer criteria positivity. Positive 
dRVVTs by both criteria correlated even more strongly with other positive APS 
assays. We investigated the likelihood of eventual APS diagnosis depending on 
the testing indication. No patient tested for LA solely for prolonged screening 
aPTT was subsequently diagnosed with APS. In patients with thrombosis, prolonged 
dRVVT clotting time not meeting both ISTH and manufacturer criteria was rarely 
associated with eventual APS diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: We examined the correlation of dRVVT results with other APS testing 
and clinical outcomes. Interpretation method impacted how dRVVT results related 
to other APS testing, and, in limited data, to clinical findings. Patients with 
prolonged dRVVTs meeting only one set of positivity criteria rarely received an 
APS diagnosis.

Prolonged remission (PR), defined as a 5-year consecutive period of no disease 
activity based on SLEDAI-2K, has been reported to be associated with a lower 
damage accrual over time in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as 
the consequence of a lower activity burden. Since disease activity is considered 
to play a role in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), we investigated 
the relationship, if any, between PR and the occurrence of a subsequent first CV 
event in patients with SLE. Out of 488 patients consecutively admitted to two 
tertiary Italian centers from November 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016, the 294 
patients, who had been followed at least for 5 years, had not experienced any CV 
event at admission, and had been visited biannually during follow-up, were 
considered for the present study. The incidence of a first CV in patients who 
had achieved PR was compared with that registered in those who had not. 
Moreover, it was compared among PR patients subdivided into three groups: 
complete remission, clinical off-corticosteroids (offCR), and clinical 
on-corticosteroids remission (onCR). Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test 
were used to analyze differences in event-free survival among groups. Cox 
regression was used to investigate disease and therapeutic features associated 
with the development of a first CV event. During 9 years median follow-up time, 
24 (8.1%) CV events occurred. Out of the 294 patients, 126 (42.8%) had achieved 
PR. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a greater overall CV event-free rate in these 
patients as compared to both those with a shorter lasting remission and those 
who had never remitted (log-rank test χ2 = 14.43; p = 0.0001). In addition, CV 
outcome did not differ among PR patients, irrespectively the type of remission 
achieved (p > 0.05). At multivariate analysis, hydroxychloroquine therapy and PR 
resulted to be protective (HR 0.19; HR 0.18), while arterial hypertension and 
antiphospholipid positivity increased the risk of a first CV event (HR 2.61; HR 
2.47). The PR, whichever the subtype, is associated with a better CV outcome and 
should be considered as a treat-to-target goal in the CV risk management of the 
lupus patient.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of dose step-down in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who achieved sustained disease control with 
baricitinib 4 mg once a day.
METHODS: Patients who completed a baricitinib phase 3 study could enter a 
long-term extension (LTE). In the LTE, patients who received baricitinib 4 mg 
for ≥15 months and maintained CDAI low disease activity (LDA) or remission (REM) 
were blindly randomised to continue 4 mg or taper to 2 mg. Patients could rescue 
(to 4 mg) if needed. Efficacy and safety were assessed through 48 weeks.
RESULTS: Patients in both groups maintained LDA (80% 4 mg; 67% 2 mg) or REM (40% 
4 mg; 33% 2 mg) over 48 weeks. However, dose reduction resulted in small, 
statistically significant increases in disease activity at 12, 24 and 48 weeks. 
Dose reduction also produced earlier and more frequent relapse (loss of 
step-down criteria) over 48 weeks compared with 4 mg maintenance (23% 4 mg vs 
37% 2 mg, p=0.001). Rescue rates were 10% for baricitinib 4 mg and 18% for 
baricitinib 2 mg. Dose reduction was associated with a numerically lower rate of 
non-serious infections (30.6 for baricitinib 4 mg vs 24.9 for 2 mg). Rates of 
serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation were 
similar across groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large randomised, blinded phase 3 study, maintenance of RA 
control following induction of sustained LDA/REM with baricitinib 4 mg was 
greater with continued 4 mg than after taper to 2 mg. Nonetheless, most patients 
tapered to 2 mg could maintain LDA/REM or recapture with return to 4 mg if 
needed.

INTRODUCTION: School-aged children with type 1 diabetes (DM1) require access to 
appropriate and safe care for their disease during their stay in the educational 
centre.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the needs perceived by families of schoolchildren with 
DM1 that affect their educational integration, safety, and well-being during the 
school day.
METHODOLOGY: A descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted using a 
questionnaire based on information and opinions provided by families of 362 
schoolchildren between 3 and 16 years old with DM1 registered in their health 
history in the Public Health System of Extremadura.
RESULTS: The response rate was 56.9% (206). It was shown that 35% of 
schoolchildren with DM1 were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion therapy. Almost all of them (95.1%) required glucose monitoring, and 
57.8% required insulin administration during the school day. Most (88%) children 
had adjusted well to school and did not describe any type of discriminatory 
treatment (87.4%). Glucagon is available in 82% of educational centres, in which 
43.7% had a trained adult person to administer it. That teachers could recognise 
a hypoglycaemia was expressed by 21.4% of the families, and 29.1% were unaware 
of the existence of coordination protocols in the school. More than half (58.7%) 
claimed that the information available in schools about diabetes was low, and 
77.2% stated that the control of the disease would improve if more training was 
provided to teachers.
CONCLUSIONS: There are aspects optimally covered in the care of schoolchildren 
with DM1 in the schools of Extremadura. Among situations identified with 
potential room for improvement were adherence to the coordination protocol, 
information about diabetes, and training of adults to deal with emergency 
situations.

Personal Projects and Psychological Well-Being: Emerging Adults With and Without 
Diabetes.

Helgeson VS(1).

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the nature of the personal 
projects that emerging adults with and without diabetes were pursuing and the 
implications of those projects for psychological well-being.
METHODS: We asked emerging adults with and without type 1 diabetes to identify 
five personal projects, rate four dimensions of those projects (importance, 
typicality, stress, and progress), and complete several well-being measures 
(depressive symptoms, life purpose, life satisfaction, perceived stress, and 
resilience) when they were age 19. Those with diabetes also indicated the extent 
to which diabetes interfered with each of the projects. We followed participants 
for 1 year to determine the status of projects and reassess project dimensions 
and psychological well-being.
RESULTS: The kinds of projects identified by the two groups were similar. 
However, those with diabetes reported lower levels of progress on projects and 
completed fewer projects 1 year later compared with controls. Project progress, 
importance, and completion were linked to higher psychological well-being, 
whereas project stress was linked to lower psychological well-being. However, 
the most robust cross-sectional and longitudinal predictor of psychological 
well-being was project typicality (i.e., the extent to which projects were 
typical of participants). The pursuit of more typical projects was linked to 
higher psychological well-being. These findings were largely similar for 
emerging adults with and without diabetes. Diabetes interference with projects 
revealed some links to psychological well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that personal project engagement and 
completion is linked to the overall mental health of emerging adults with and 
without diabetes.

Manca, A, Dvir, Z, and Deriu, F. Meta-analytic and scoping study on strength 
training in people with multiple sclerosis. J Strength Cond Res 33(3): 874-889, 
2019-Aim of the study was to determine a pooled estimate of effect on muscle 
strength and functional capacity induced by strength training in people with 
multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Five databases and 2 public registries were searched 
from inception to May 2017. Indexing terms used were: "multiple sclerosis," 
"resistance training," and "strength training." After title/abstract screening, 
2 independent reviewers evaluated the studies' eligibility, which were retained 
if PwMS were randomly assigned to strength training or to a no intervention 
group. Of the 1,467 items retrieved, 30 randomized controlled trials formed the 
initial database with 11 trials (426 subjects) entering the final meta-analysis. 
The quality of the included studies was assessed by the PEDro scale and the risk 
of bias using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. All meta-analyses were conducted 
using a random effects model. After interventions, PwMS increased strength by 
23.1% (confidence interval [CI] 11.8-34.4; +12.1 N; CI 4.5-19.8; p = 0.002; n = 
366 subjects) at a small-to-moderate effect size (0.37; CI 0.2-0.6). Walking 
speed increased by 16.3 ± 10.7% (p = 0.0002; effect size 0.54; n = 275 
subjects), distance covered in the 2-minute walking test by 6.7 ± 6.4% (p = 
0.04; effect size 0.50; n = 111 subjects). People with MS respond to resistance 
training with consistent strength gains. Methodological inconsistencies among 
studies and inadequate reporting of the findings limited a comprehensive 
determination of the impact of strength improvements on patient functioning, 
except for walking performance which seemed significantly improved. 
Methodological steps and scoping lines are provided to establish a common 
platform for future trials.

Rheumatology represents a discipline full of differential diagnoses. Even for 
classical diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis as the most frequent chronic 
inflammatory joint disease and described so clearly in many textbooks, it is not 
uncommon that it can be a diagnostic challenge in daily practice. This applies 
to arthritic joint involvement and also to frequently associated extra-articular 
manifestations. The patient history and results of the clinical examination are 
essential; however, laboratory and imaging findings often make a significant 
contribution to confirming the diagnosis, especially in early phases of the 
disease. This article, which makes no claims to completeness, focuses on 
diseases that in the opinion of the authors can imitate rheumatoid arthritis due 
to similar joint and other organ manifestations. These include metabolic, 
inflammatory infective and non-infective as well as tumorous diseases. 
A misinterpretation as rheumatoid arthritis as a rule leads to long-term and 
severe consequences for affected patients. Thus, the diagnosis of rheumatoid 
arthritis should be questioned and re-evaluated in cases of unusual accompanying 
symptoms, atypical course of disease and a lack of response to standard 
treatment approaches.

Patient survival after pancreas after kidney transplant (PAK) has been reported 
to be inferior to patient survival after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant 
(SPK). The authors examine national data to further explore allograft (kidney 
and pancreas) and patient survival after PAK. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional 
hazard models were used to analyze Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network 
data from 1995 to 2010. The analysis compared PAK and SPK candidates and 
recipients. Kaplan-Meier analysis results showed that PAK after either a living 
or a deceased donor kidney transplant is associated with increased kidney graft 
survival compared with recipients with type 1 diabetes who received only a 
kidney. The best kidney allograft survival was for patients who received a 
living donor kidney followed by PAK. Receiving a living donor kidney was 
associated with increased pancreas allograft survival compared with receiving a 
deceased donor kidney. PAK transplant recipients who receive both organs have a 
survival advantage compared with uremic candidates who receive neither (SPK 
waitlist). Compared with uremic diabetic waitlist patients, SPK and PAK 
recipients showed similar overall patient survival. Successful PAK offers a 
survival advantage compared with receiving neither a kidney nor a pancreas 
transplant. These data also suggest that receiving a pancreas (after kidney) 
transplant may have a protective effect on the kidney allograft.

OBJECTIVE: Currently published data regarding the potential role of 
osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OCN) and osteopontin (OPN) for the 
discrimination between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are 
contradictory. To derive a more precise evaluation, a meta-analysis was 
performed.
METHODS: Published literatures comparing plasma/serum OPG, OCN and OPN levels 
between RA group and OA controls were searched in PubMed, Embase and the 
Cochrane Library. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the study 
quality. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) 
was calculated by random-effect model analysis. Heterogeneity test was performed 
by the Q statistic and quantified using I2.
RESULTS: Nine studies including 438 RA patients and 255 OA patients were finally 
incorporated in the meta-analysis after examining title, type, abstracts and 
full text. The results showed that RA patients had higher plasma/serum OPN 
(pooled SMD = -2.57, 95% CI = -4.72 to -0.41) levels when compared to OA 
patients. No significant difference in plasma/serum OPG (pooled SMD = -0.29, 95% 
CI = -1.07‒0.49) and OCN (pooled SMD = -0.09, 95% CI = -0.48‒0.31) levels were 
found between RA patients and OA patients. Subgroup analysis indicated that 
plasma/serum OPG levels had no significant differences between RA patients and 
OA patients in Europe and Asian.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is no significant difference in circulating OPG and 
OCN levels between RA patients and OA patients. However, plasma/serum OPN level 
is significantly higher in RA patients compared with OA patients.

OBJECTIVE: A new sonoelastography technique - virtual touch tissue 
quantification of acoustic radiation force impulses (ARFI) - offers a promising 
method for measuring tissue rigidity. The aim of this study was to assess the 
usefulness of ARFI for diagnosing Sjögren's syndrome (SS).
METHODS: This transversal prospective study included 41 patients with SS 
according to American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria, and a control 
group without symptoms. All subjects underwent ARFI high-resolution ultrasound 
assessment of the parotid glands (PG) and submandibular glands (SMG).
RESULTS: In patients with SS, parotid gland shear wave velocity (SWV) was 
2.08 m/s ± 0.55, significantly higher than in control subjects (1.2 m/s ± 0.17) 
(P = 0.0001); submandibular gland SWV was higher in SS patients 
(2.12 m/s ± 0.44) than control subjects (1.56 m/s ± 0.16) (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Acoustic radiation force impulses sonoelastography can assist 
diagnosis of SS, and is a non-invasive and fast method of detecting pathological 
changes to the parotid and submandibular glands.

The developing immune system is particularly sensitive to immunotoxicants. This 
study assessed trichloroethylene (TCE)-induced effects on the gut microbiome and 
cytokine production during the development in mice. Mice were exposed to TCE 
(0.05 or 500 μg/mL) at the levels that approximate to environmental or 
occupational exposure, respectively. Mice were subjected to a continuous 
developmental exposure to these doses encompassing gestation, lactation and 
continuing directly in the drinking water postnatally for 154 days (PND154) or 
PND259. To observe persistence of the effect TCE was removed from the drinking 
water in a subset of mice on PND154 and were provided regular drinking water 
until the study terminus (PND259). Abundance of total tissue-associated bacteria 
reduced only in mice exposed to TCE until PND259. The ratio of 
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes did not alter during this continuos exposure; however, 
cessation of high-dose TCE at PND154 resulted in the increased abundance 
Bacteroidetes at PND259. Furthermore, high-dose TCE exposure until PND259 
resulted in a lower abundance of the genera Bacteroides and Lactobaccilus and 
increased abundance of genus Bifidobactrium and bacterial family 
Enterobacteriaceae. TCE exposure until PND154 showed significant changes in the 
production of interleukin-33; that might play a dual role in maintaining the 
balance and homeostasis between commensal microbiota and mucosal health. At 
PND259, interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 
Eotaxin were altered in both, the continuous exposure and cessation groups, 
whereas only a cessation group had a higher level of KC that may facilitate 
infiltration of neutrophils. The irreversible effects of TCE after a period of 
exposure cessation suggested a unique programming and potential toxicity of TCE 
even at the environmental level exposure.

Endocrine Toxicity of Cancer Immunotherapy Targeting Immune Checkpoints.

Immune checkpoints are small molecules expressed by immune cells that play 
critical roles in maintaining immune homeostasis. Targeting the immune 
checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed 
death 1 (PD-1) with inhibitory antibodies has demonstrated effective and durable 
antitumor activity in subgroups of patients with cancer. The US Food and Drug 
Administration has approved several immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPis) for the 
treatment of a broad spectrum of malignancies. Endocrinopathies have emerged as 
one of the most common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of ICPi therapy. 
Hypophysitis, thyroid dysfunction, insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, and 
primary adrenal insufficiency have been reported as irAEs due to ICPi therapy. 
Hypophysitis is particularly associated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy, whereas 
thyroid dysfunction is particularly associated with anti-PD-1 therapy. Diabetes 
mellitus and primary adrenal insufficiency are rare endocrine toxicities 
associated with ICPi therapy but can be life-threatening if not promptly 
recognized and treated. Notably, combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy 
is associated with the highest incidence of ICPi-related endocrinopathies. The 
precise mechanisms underlying these endocrine irAEs remain to be elucidated. 
Most ICPi-related endocrinopathies occur within 12 weeks after the initiation of 
ICPi therapy, but several have been reported to develop several months to years 
after ICPi initiation. Some ICPi-related endocrinopathies may resolve 
spontaneously, but others, such as central adrenal insufficiency and primary 
hypothyroidism, appear to be persistent in most cases. The mainstay of 
management of ICPi-related endocrinopathies is hormone replacement and symptom 
control. Further studies are needed to determine (i) whether high-dose 
corticosteroids in the treatment of ICPi-related endocrinopathies preserves 
endocrine function (especially in hypophysitis), and (ii) whether the 
development of ICPi-related endocrinopathies correlates with tumor response to 
ICPi therapy.

OBJECTIVES: Blood pressure (BP) physiologically declines more than 10% at night. 
Subjects who do not experience this drop are classified as non-dippers. They 
have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Vitamin D deficiency and 
non-dipper pattern have been associated in the general population. Patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency, 
a non-dipper pattern and CVD. We aimed to evaluate a possible relationship 
between vitamin D deficiency and non-dipper pattern in patients with SLE.
METHODS: Using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, 77 women with SLE were divided 
into dippers and non-dippers. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were compared 
between both groups. A multivariate analysis was used to determine which 
variables were independently associated with non-dipper pattern.
RESULTS: 62% of patients were non-dippers. They had lower levels of 25(OH)D than 
dippers (19.4±8.9 vs. 25.9±10.1 ng/ml, p=0.005). Patients with lower 25(OH)D 
levels were more likely to be non-dippers (OR 3.7, 95%CI 1.2-11.4; p=0.025). The 
nocturnal decline of mean BP correlated with levels of 25(OH)D (r=0.227, 
p=0.047). Night-time systolic, diastolic and mean BP inversely correlated with 
the levels of 25(OH)D (r=-0.274, p=0.016; r=-0.238, p=0.037, and r=-0.260, 
p=0.022, respectively), but only night- time systolic BP remained significant 
after adjustment for age and body mass index (r=-0.228, p=0.049). 25(OH)D levels 
and the use of mycophenolate were found to be independently associated with 
non-dipper pattern in SLE patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the development of a 
non-dipper pattern in patients with SLE.

OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) polymorphisms have been reported to be 
associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), however, the results are 
controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis with trial sequential 
analysis to evaluate a more accurate estimation of the associations.
METHODS: Eligible studies were retrieved by searching PubMed, Embase, Google 
Scholar, VIP, Wan Fang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was evaluated by Q 
statistic and I2 statistic. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis 
(stratified by HWE, region, event sample size, source of controls, genotyping 
method) were conducted and the potential for publication bias was assessed. 
Trial sequential analysis was introduced to assess the information size and the 
positive results.
RESULTS: Twenty case-control studies were included. Overall results from 
IL10-1082A/G polymorphism showed increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, 
but no significant associations were observed in both IL10-819C/T and 
IL10-592C/A polymorphism. Increased risk of SLE was also observed in IL10A/G 
polymorphism in Asian population, hospital-based and PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain 
reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism) subgroups. In addition, 
decreased risk of SLE was widely detected in IL10-819C/T and IL10-592C/A 
polymorphisms in subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the IL10-1082A/G polymorphism is a risk 
factor in systemic lupus erythematosus. A decreased risk of SLE in the 
IL10-819C/T and IL10-592C/A polymorphisms in subgroups was also observed, but 
further rigorously studies are needed to confirm these results.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative risk (RR) of 
respiratory adverse events (AEs) among patients with RA treated with TCZ.
METHODS: Databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) were searched for 
randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing the use of TCZ with placebo (PBO) 
or active comparator agents in adults with RA published until October 28, 2017. 
Statistical analyses were conducted to calculate the RR of infectious and 
non-infectious respiratory AEs and severe AEs (SAEs) using random-effects or 
fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of the included studies.
RESULTS: Eight trials were ultimately included. TCZ was associated with an 
increased risk of infectious respiratory AEs relative to comparator agents (RR 
1.53, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.04-2.25) but was not associated with an 
increased risk of non-infectious respiratory AEs (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.86-1.64). A 
subgroup analysis revealed similar results for non-infectious AEs and SAEs in 
the comparisons of TCZ with MTX and adalimumab (ADA), whereas increased risks of 
these AEs but not SAEs were observed compared with the PBO.
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis did not reveal an increase in the risk of 
non-infectious respiratory AEs in adult patients with RA who were treated with 
TCZ compared with other csDMARDs and bDMARDs in RCTs.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in 
combination with methotrexate (MTX) in Chinese patients with active rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response to MTX.
METHODS: This 24-week, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was 
conducted in 30 centres across China. A total of 430 patients were randomised 
3:1 to receive CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (loading dose: 400 mg CZP at Weeks 0, 2 
and 4) plus MTX or placebo (PBO) plus MTX. The primary endpoint was ACR20 
response at Week 24, for which the superiority of CZP+MTX over PBO+MTX was 
evaluated. Additional parameters for clinical efficacy, health outcomes, 
immunogenicity and safety were assessed.
RESULTS: At Week 24, 54.8% of CZP+MTX patients and 23.9% of PBO+MTX patients 
achieved ACR20 (odds ratio: 3.9, p<0.001). CZP+MTX patients also achieved 
greater improvements in HAQ-DI, higher ACR50/70 responses and higher DAS28(ESR) 
remission rate at Week 24. Rapid onset of response to CZP+MTX was observed as 
early as Week 1 for most of the clinical, functional and patient-reported 
outcomes. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar 
between treatment arms. Serious TEAEs were reported by 6.3% of CZP+MTX patients 
and 2.7% of PBO+MTX patients. No new safety signals were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: CZP in combination with MTX showed an acceptable safety profile, a 
rapid onset of response and sustained effects in reducing the signs and symptoms 
of RA and improving physical function in Chinese patients with RA and an 
inadequate response to MTX.

Is an artificial pancreas (closed-loop system) for Type 1 diabetes effective?

Boughton CK(1), Hovorka R(1).

University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

The artificial pancreas is now a viable treatment option for people with Type 1 
diabetes and has demonstrated improved glycaemic outcomes while also reducing 
the onus of self-management of Type 1 diabetes. Closed-loop glucose-responsive 
insulin delivery guided by real-time sensor glucose readings can accommodate 
highly variable day-to-day insulin requirements and reduce the hypoglycaemia 
risk observed with tight glycaemic control in Type 1 diabetes. In 2011, the 
James Lind Alliance research priorities for Type 1 diabetes were produced and 
priority 3 was to establish whether an artificial pancreas (closed-loop system) 
for Type 1 diabetes is effective. This review focuses on the progress that has 
been made in the evolution of closed-loop systems as an effective treatment 
option for Type 1 diabetes. Development of closed-loop systems has advanced from 
feasibility evaluations in highly supervised settings over short periods, to 
clinical studies in free-living, unsupervised conditions lasting several months. 
The approval in the USA of the first hybrid closed-loop system (MiniMed® 670G 
pump, Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA) in 2016 for use in Type 1 diabetes 
reflects these advancements. We discuss the evidence from clinical studies that 
closed-loop systems are effective with improved glycaemic outcomes, reduced 
hypoglycaemia and had positive end-user acceptance in children, adolescents, 
adults and pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes. We also present the outlook for 
future closed-loop systems in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes and identify the 
challenges facing the wide-spread clinical adoption of this technology.

Myelin is a multilamellar cell membrane around axons and is essential for fast 
saltatory conduction and maintenance of axonal integrity and survival. 
Congenital and acquired abnormalities of myelin lead to neurological disorders 
involving degeneration and loss of axons and neurons, which are implicated in 
permanent neurological deficits and progressive neurological decline. As in 
other neurological disorders, neural degeneration and loss in myelin diseases 
are associated with multiple factors including aberrant inflammatory responses, 
oxidative stresses, and impaired axonal metabolism involving cationic 
sequestration and energy production. Metabolic regulation depends on 
mitochondrial function, and impaired mitochondrial dynamics cause degeneration 
and loss of axons and neurons. Future studies on the regulatory mechanisms of 
axonal and neuronal degeneration in myelin diseases, which include further 
development of animal models and better screening approaches for possible 
interventions, contribute to deeper understanding of axonal interactions with 
glia and myelin ensheathment and potentially lead to novel therapeutic 
strategies to protect the function and survival of axons and neurons in myelin 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Tonsillectomy performed on patients with Immunoglobulin A 
glomerulonephritis (IgAN) improved the clinical remission rate as defined by 
urinary protein. But the number of times steroid pulse therapies (SP) should be 
administered remained poorly understood.
METHOD: Multicenter, observational, retrospective cohort study at four hospitals 
in the Tokyo metropolitan area between March 1981 and December 2013. We divided 
patients into two groups: those treated with SP three times and those treated 
without SP or with SP only once or twice, and we analyzed standard Cox 
proportional hazard model unadjusted and adjusted the confounding covariates to 
estimate the hazard ratio for the primary outcome, the 30% estimated decline in 
glomerular filtration rate, in four models: model 1, unadjusted; model 2, 
adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, 
biopsy year, proteinuria, hematuria, Japanese historical grade, systolic blood 
pressure, smoking history, and diabetes as a comorbidity; model 3, adjusted for 
propensity score, which was estimated by multiple logistic regressions; model 4, 
multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival models, whose facilities comprise 
the second level.
RESULTS: Patients that received three times SP therapy were significantly 
associated with better renal outcome compared with patients with less number of 
SP therapy (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.37-1.17 in model 1, 0.40 (0.20-0.78) in model 2, 
0.46 (0.25-0.88) in model 3, 0.36 (0.18-0.71) in model 4).
CONCLUSIONS: For treatment of IgAN, SP administered three times after 
tonsillectomy was associated with better renal prognosis compared with SP 
administered only once or twice.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system autoimmune disease 
characterized by demyelination. Autoreactive T cells mainly interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ) producing T helper cells (Th1) have an important role in MS 
pathogenesis. Silymarin is a unique blend produced from milk thistle (Silybum 
marianum) plant which its imunomodulatory role has been indicated in studies. In 
the present study, the effects of silymarin on isolated Th1 cells were 
investigated in newly diagnosed MS patients and those who received betaferon. 
PBMCs were separated from newly diagnosed and IFN-β-treated MS patients. The Th1 
cell isolation from PBMCs was performed using a human Th1 cell isolation kit. 
Th1 cells were cultured in the presence of silymarin (50, 100, and 150 μM for 
48, 72, and 120 h). Th1 cell proliferation and CD69 expression were assessed by 
flow cytometry. Also, IFN-γ production and T-bet gene expression were measured 
by ELISA and real-time PCR respectively. In vitro cultured Th1 cells showed that 
silymarin suppresses Th1 cell proliferation dose and time dependently in newly 
diagnosed and IFN-β-treated MS patients in comparison to DMSO control. Also, 
CD69 expression as an early activation marker was changed after Th1 cell 
treatment with different doses of silymarin at different times. T-bet gene 
expression was significantly decreased in Th1 cells isolated from newly 
diagnosed and IFN-β-treated RRMS patients after treatment with silymarin 
compared to DMSO control. Additionally, IFN-γ production by Th1 cells was 
decreased after treatment silymarin in newly diagnosed patients; however, in 
IFN-β treated after 48-h treatment with silymarin, IFN-γ concentration was 
decreased at concentrations of 100 and 150 μM, and after 120 h, a significant 
increase was observed in the IFN-γ level at a concentration of 100 μM in 
comparison with DMSO. Our findings here clearly show that silymarin is an 
effective regulator for Th1 response in vitro condition. It not only suppresses 
Th1 proliferating activity but also inhibits T-bet gene expression and IFN-γ 
production by these cells.

In rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, cardiovascular disease 
is frequently one of the leading causes of mortality or morbidity. Studies have 
shown that acute systemic inflammation and chronic systemic vasculitis are 
associated with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic plaque formation, 
subsequently leading to cardiovascular disease. This meta-analysis aimed to 
explore the association of subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness in 
primary Sjogren's syndrome. A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and Embase 
databases was performed from date of inception through August 2017. The 
inclusion criterion was observational studies evaluating the association between 
primary Sjogren's syndrome, subclinical atherosclerosis, and arterial stiffness 
by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV) and intima-media thickness (IMT). 
Definitions of PSS and methods to assess PWV and IMT were recorded for each 
study. Different locations of IMT were evaluated including common carotid, 
internal carotid, and femoral arteries. The pooled mean difference (MD) of PWV 
and IMT and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect 
meta-analysis. The between-study heterogeneity of effect size was quantified 
using the Q statistic and I2. Data were extracted from eight observational 
studies involving 767 subjects. Pooled result demonstrated a significant 
increase in PWV in patients who have PSS compared with controls (MD = 1.30 m/s; 
95% CI 0.48-2.12; p value = 0.002; I2 = 85%). Patients with PSS also have higher 
IMT (MD = 0.08 mm; 95% CI 0.04-0.11; p value < 0.01; I2 = 72%). Our study 
suggests that PSS is associated with arterial stiffness and subclinical 
atherosclerosis. Further studies need to be conducted to find the correlation of 
subclinical atherosclerosis in PSS with the cardiovascular event, the 
pathophysiological changes of arterial stiffness in PSS, and the benefit of 
statins, because controlling cardiovascular risk factors or disease activity 
could potentially help avoid progression of atherosclerosis to overt 
cardiovascular disease.

We report a case during which a new method of reconstruction for a 
nasopharyngeal and skull base defect was successfully performed. A 45-year-old 
female with granulomatosis with polyangiitis presented with computed tomography 
(CT) findings demonstrative of chronic clival and cervical spine osteomyelitis 
secondary to nasopharyngeal destruction. The posterior nasopharyngeal defect, 
evident as a wide area of mucosal erosion exposing the clivus centrally, was 
successfully reconstructed with an anterior serratus muscle-free tissue transfer 
via both transcervical and endoscopic transnasal approaches utilizing a 
laparoscopic fixation device, a previously unreported method for free flap 
inset, to secure the free flap. The patient tolerated this well and no major 
complications were encountered. At 2-year follow-up, the patient was without 
signs of cerebrospinal fluid leak or sequelae of infectious complications, 
including meningitis and osteomyelitis. A combined transcervical and endoscopic 
transnasal approach using a laparoscopic fixation device for free flap inset can 
be an effective method to reconstruct posterior nasopharyngeal defects in those 
patients whom local reconstructive options are not available.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fampridine leads to significant improvements in walking 
in many people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, a relevant proportion of 
PwMS does not respond to fampridine and predictors of initial drug 
responsiveness are unknown.
METHODS: Drug response to prolonged-release (PR)-fampridine was assessed in 55 
PwMS using the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 6-min walk test (6MWT) and 12-item 
multiple sclerosis walking scale as outcome parameters. Patients were treated 
with PR-fampridine and placebo for 6 weeks each in a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial with crossover design (NCT01576354). Possible 
predictors of drug responsiveness were investigated by multiple correlation 
analysis and binary logistic regression models. An additional longitudinal 
analysis followed the drug responses of 32 patients treated with PR-fampridine 
over 3 years to identify potential predictors of long-term drug responsiveness.
RESULTS: Severity of walking disability was positively correlated with enhanced 
responses to PR-fampridine. The strongest single predictor of drug 
responsiveness was poor 6MWT performance at baseline, which was positively 
correlated with enhanced drug response in the 6MWT (R = -0.541; P < 0.001). A 
multivariable logistic regression model including 6MWT and T25FW baseline 
performances predicted PR-fampridine responder status with an accuracy of 85.5% 
(specificity, 90.0%; sensitivity, 73.3%), with a threshold of 211 m in the 6MWT 
best separating responders from non-responders. Enhanced drug responsiveness 
after 3 years correlated with decline in walking endurance during this period 
(R = -0.634; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Initial walking impairment is a good predictor of therapeutic 
responsiveness to PR-fampridine. Valid predictors of patients' responsiveness to 
PR-fampridine are essential for patient stratification and optimization of 
multiple slcerosis treatment.

Sjögren syndrome (SS) is a systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease 
characterized by systemic disorders of the exocrine glands, predominantly the 
salivary and lacrimal glands. Here, we report a 4-year-old boy who presented 
with the repetition of generalized tonic-clonic seizures for 1-2 min. Initially, 
he was diagnosed with idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis and was treated with 
steroids. He was eventually diagnosed with SS based on the examination results, 
such as inflammatory cell infiltration into the minor salivary glands and 
positive serum anti-SSA/Ro antibody. Although central nervous system 
complications are rare in pediatric SS, this condition should be considered in 
the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with idiopathic autoimmune 
encephalitis of unknown cause. Furthermore, SS can occur in relatively young 
children and can present without imaging abnormalities.

DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic modification with a prominent role in 
determining mammalian cell development, lineage identity, and transcriptional 
regulation. Primarily linked to gene silencing, novel technologies have expanded 
the ability to measure DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale and uncover 
context-dependent regulatory roles. The immune system is a prototypic model for 
studying how DNA methylation patterning modulates cell type- and 
stimulus-specific transcriptional programs. Preservation of host defense and 
organ homeostasis depends on fine-tuned epigenetic mechanisms controlling 
myeloid and lymphoid cell differentiation and function, which shape innate and 
adaptive immune responses. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to human 
immune system pathology as seen in blood malignancies, infections, and 
autoimmune diseases. Identification of distinct epigenotypes linked to 
pathogenesis carries the potential to validate therapeutic targets in disease 
prevention and management.

BACKGROUND: Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease with pemphigus 
vulgaris (PV) and foliaceus (PF) as the two major histological subtypes. 
Associations with HLA molecules have been suggested, but specific HLA risk 
variants as well as non-HLA risk variants remain to be discovered.
METHODS: We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study in the Chinese 
Han population through a genome-wide discovery analysis and follow-up validation 
analysis in a total number of 210 PV, 159 PF and 2493 healthy controls. HLA 
imputation as well as high coverage next generation sequencing based HLA 
genotyping was employed to investigate the association of classical HLA alleles 
and amino acid change.
RESULTS: We have discovered independent novel associations with PF at rs2178077 
on 12q24.33, located next to RAN (PPF = 1.57 × 10-9 ) and rs3888722 within the 
MHC region (P = 6.73 × 10-9 ). For the HLA variants, we confirmed independent 
genome-wide level risk associations in HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1, with DQB1*05:03 to 
be the strongest association with PV (P = 8.59 × 10-68 , OR = 31.16) and PF (P = 
4.84 × 10-17 , OR = 5.64). In addition, DRB1*14 was demonstrated to be a second 
independent variants (P = 4.2 × 10-63 , OR = 35.47) for PV, while DRB1*04:06 was 
demonstrated to be the second independent signal (P = 7.44 × 10-13 , OR = 5.58) 
for PF.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of 
pemphigus susceptibility and may offer opportunities for risk prediction and 
preventive treatment for pemphigus, in particular for PV.

Previously, we reported that mRNA expression of ficolin-1 (FCN1), a component of 
the complement lectin pathway, is elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
of patients with vasculitis syndrome, and that FCN1-positive cells infiltrate 
into inflamed regions in patient specimens. In addition, we reported that the 
serum FCN1 concentration is elevated in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD), a 
pediatric vasculitis, but dramatically decreases after intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Furthermore, we showed that FCN1 binds to IgG1 
in a pull-down assay. These results suggested that removal of FCN1 may be a 
therapeutic mechanism of IVIG. In this study, we prepared anti-FCN1 monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) and examined its therapeutic potential in mice treated with 
Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS), which induces KD-like vasculitis 
in the coronary artery. Indeed, treatment with anti-FCN1 mAb decreased the 
histological score of vasculitis (P = 0.03). To investigate the role of FCN1, we 
assessed blood samples of patients with various autoimmune diseases and 
demonstrated that serum levels of FCN1 were elevated not only in patients with 
vasculitis, but also in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, 
FCN1-targeted treatment of a mouse model of arthritis [collagen antibody-induced 
arthritis (CAIA)] revealed that administration of anti-FCN1 mAb ameliorated 
symptoms of arthritis (P < 0.01). These results suggest that FCN1 is involved in 
the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and that targeting FCN1 represents a 
promising strategy for treating these diseases.

The aims of this research were to evaluate and compare the effect in a matched 
sample of patients with type II and type I diabetes scores using a specific 
quality-of-life (QoL) tool related to overall and foot health (Foot Health 
Status Questionnaire [FHSQ]). A sample of 62 patients with an age median of 
59.00 ± 19.00 y were divided into type I (n = 31) and type II (n = 31) diabetes 
groups. Socio-demographics data include: (1) age, (2) gender, (3) body mass 
index, (4) professional activity, (5) study level, and (6) civil status. The 
FHSQ was used to evaluate foot (pain, function, footwear, and general health 
section I domains) and overall (general health, social capacity, physical 
activity, and vigour section II domains) health related to QoL. Differences 
between groups were assessed by means of a t test or Mann-Whitney U test for 
independent samples. There were no statistically significant differences (P > 
0.05) for any socio-demographic data. Regarding the FHSQ section II of the 
specific foot health-related QoL, the only statistically significant differences 
(P = 0.042) were observed for the general foot health showing a QoL impairment 
(lower median ± interquartile range) in patients diagnosed with type II diabetes 
(60.00 ± 60.00 points) compared with patients who suffered from type I diabetes 
(25.00 ± 72.50 points). The other domains did not show any statistically 
significant differences (P > 0.05). Patients with type II diabetes present a 
negative impact on the specific foot health-related QoL compared with patients 
who suffered from type I diabetes.

AIM: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major adverse events of concern associated 
with the use of biologics for managing autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic 
diseases (AIRDs). The study presents the data on incidence of TB in relation to 
biologic used, screening test and TB prophylaxis in a real-world setting.
METHODS: The cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study was conducted 
across 12 centres in Karnataka, India. The study included patients receiving 
biologics therapy for AIRDs, established based on the respective diagnostic 
criteria. The development of TB after receiving biologic therapy and other 
clinical variables and the predictability of the test performed for latent TB 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-five AIRDs patients with an average age of 41 
years were initiated on biologic therapy. Twenty-one patients were latent TB 
positive and were given antitubercular prophylaxis, prior to biologics 
treatment. During follow-up, seven patients belonging to the negative test group 
(n = 174) developed TB. The negative predictive values noted for Mantoux test (n 
= 120) and quantiFERON TB gold test (n = 178) were 96.52% and 96.25%, 
respectively. Patients on anti-tumor necrosis factor were more likely to develop 
TB. Presence of comorbidities and steroid use increased the likelihood of 
developing TB by 1.5 and 4.6 times, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Close monitoring of patients receiving biologics is essential for 
early identification of adverse events, especially in test negative patients. 
Prophylaxis can effectively reduce the risk of developing TB in patients 
positive for screening.

AIM: This study aimed to determine the influence of methotrexate (MTX) on 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 529 consecutive patients with RA 
receiving oral MTX in our department between April 1 and September 30, 2017. GI 
symptoms were evaluated by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS); a 
score of ≥2 was considered "symptomatic." Prevalence of GI symptoms was compared 
between patients receiving ≤8 mg/wk (low-dose) vs >8 mg/wk (high-dose) of MTX.
RESULTS: Of our study population, 313 (59%) received low-dose MTX at a median 
(interquartile range) dose of 6 (6-8) mg/wk, whereas 216 (41%) received 
high-dose MTX at a median dose of 12 (10-12) mg/wk. Relative to the low-dose MTX 
group, the high-dose MTX group exhibited a higher prevalence of reflux (32% vs 
24%, P = 0.043) and abdominal pain (28% vs 18%, P = 0.007). There was no 
significant group-dependent difference in the prevalence of indigestion, 
diarrhea or constipation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed 
that high-dose MTX (>8 mg/wk) was independently associated with reflux (odds 
ratio [OR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.43) and abdominal pain 
(OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.04-2.43), and that the ORs for reflux and abdominal pain 
among those receiving high-dose MTX (>8 mg/wk) were similar to those using 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
CONCLUSION: High-dose MTX is independently associated with the prevalence of 
upper GI symptoms in Japanese patients with RA.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether low serum C3 level can cross-sectionally 
estimate severe antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis 
(AAV) in immunosuppressive drug-naïve patients at diagnosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 139 patients with 
AAV, who were first classified as AAV at Severance Hospital. We obtained 
clinical and laboratory data including serum complement 3 (C3) level and 
calculated Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS) at diagnosis. We 
stratified AAV patients into three groups according to the tertile of BVAS and 
defined the lower limit of the highest tertile as the cutoff for severe AAV 
(BVAS at diagnosis ≥ 16) at diagnosis. Low serum C3 level was defined as 
C3 < 90 mg/dL. The odds ratio (OR) was assessed using the multivariable logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 56.3 years and 41 patients were men 
(29.5%). The mean initial BVAS was 12.8. The mean serum C3 and C4 levels were 
110.6 and 26.8 mg/dL. Thirty-one patients (22.3%) exhibited low serum C3 level 
at diagnosis. In the multivariable analysis, serum C3 level at 
diagnosis < 90 mg/dL (OR 2.963) exhibited the significant association with 
severe AAV at diagnosis. Patients with low serum C3 level exhibited a 
significantly high relative risk (RR) for severe AAV at diagnosis compared to 
those without (RR 3.600). Patients with low serum C3 level at diagnosis 
exhibited poor renal prognosis than those without.
CONCLUSION: Low serum C3 level can estimate severe AAV and predict poor renal 
outcome in immunosuppressive drug-naïve patients at diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune liver disease (AILD) includes autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) 
and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC). AILD is often associated with other 
extra-hepatic immune-mediated disorders (EDs), but there are few pediatric 
studies available to date. In this study we evaluated the association between 
AILD and EDs in our pediatric series.
METHODS: In this single centre retrospective study 48 patients (39 AIH and 9 ASC 
children) were evaluated. Thirty-six children were primarily referred to our 
Centre for liver disease suspicion, while the remaining twelve had a previous 
diagnosis of EDs. All the patients were screened for various EDs at AILD 
diagnosis and yearly during the follow-up.
RESULTS: Mean duration of follow-up was 9 years and 1 month. Twenty-two (46%) 
patients had a diagnosis of EDs. Ulcerative colitis (UC) was the most frequent 
EDs (9 patients), followed by autoimmune thyroid disease (5 patients) and celiac 
disease (5 patients). In 7 out of 9 UC patients, ASC was present.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a high association (46%) between AILD and EDs. In 
particular, in 8 out of 9 ASC patients UC was diagnosed (p-value 0.007). It is 
important to look for EDs in AILD children and, conversely, AILD in EDs children 
with abnormal liver function tests.

BACKGROUND: The burden of the pemphigoid group of autoimmune blistering diseases 
is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate standardized overall and sex-specific, age-specific, and 
race-specific prevalence estimates for pemphigoid among adults in the United 
States.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of electronic health records data for a 
demographically heterogeneous population-based sample of >55 million patients 
across all 4 census regions.
RESULTS: Overall pemphigoid prevalence was 0.012%, or 12 pemphigoid 
patients/100,000 adults. Prevalence of pemphigoid among those aged ≥60 years was 
0.038%, or 37.7 cases/100,000 adults. Prevalence increased ∼2-fold within each 
successive age group and was highest among patients aged ≥90 years (123.6 [95% 
CI 115.2-132.5] cases/100,000 adults). Adjusted prevalence in women was 12.7 
(95% CI 12.3-13.2) cases/100,000 adults, slightly more than that in men (11.0 
[95% CI 10.5-11.6] cases/100,000 adults). Adjusted prevalences were similar for 
blacks (15.4 [95% CI 14.0-17.0] cases/100,000 adults) and whites (13.5 [95% CI 
13.0-13.9] cases/100,000 adults).
LIMITATIONS: Analysis of electronic health data might result in disease 
misclassification.
CONCLUSION: Pemphigoid is rare in the United States. Patients aged ≥60 years 
comprise the majority of cases.

AIM: Interleukin (IL)-7 signalling modulates T cell activity and is implicated 
in numerous autoimmune diseases. The present study investigated the safety, 
pharmacokinetics, target engagement, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of 
GSK2618960, an IL-7 receptor-α subunit (CD127) monoclonal antibody.
METHODS: A double-blind (sponsor-unblind) study of a single intravenous infusion 
of either GSK2618960 (0.6 mg kg-1 or 2.0 mg kg-1 ) or placebo was carried out in 
18 healthy subjects over 24 weeks.
RESULTS: GSK2618960 was well tolerated; there were no serious or significant 
adverse events. The observed half-life was 5 (±1) days (2.0 mg kg-1 ), with 
nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Full receptor occupancy (>95%) was observed until 
day 8 (0.6 mg kg-1 ) and day 22 (2.0 mg kg-1 ). Maximal inhibition of 
IL-7-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) 
phosphorylation was observed in 5/6 subjects until day 22 (2.0 mg kg-1 ). Mean 
circulating IL-7 and soluble receptor (CD127) levels were increased above 
baseline during days 2 and 15 (0.6 mg kg-1 ) and days 2 and 22 (2.0 mg kg-1 ). 
No meaningful changes were observed in absolute numbers or proportions of immune 
cell populations or inflammatory cytokine profiles (IL-6, tumour necrosis 
factor-α, interferon-γ, IL-2). Persistent antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were 
detected in 5/6 subjects administered a dose of 0.6 mg kg-1 (neutralizing in 
2/6) and in 6/6 subjects administered 2.0 mg kg-1 (neutralizing in 5/6).
CONCLUSION: GSK2618960 was well tolerated and blocked IL-7 receptor signalling 
upon full target engagement. Although there was no discernible impact on 
peripheral T cell subsets in healthy subjects, GSK2618960 may effectively 
modulate the autoinflammatory activity of pathogenic T cells in diseased tissue. 
A relatively short half-life is likely the result of target-mediated rather than 
ADA-mediated clearance.

The critical role of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the 
development of kidney disease has been well demonstrated in animal and 
cell-culture experiments, but evidence from human kidney tissues is lacking. In 
this study, we screened 438 patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and analyzed 
their clinical characteristics. Renal biopsy revealed the expression of 
angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R), 
and MAS receptor (MASR) in the tissues of 260 patients not treated with RAS 
inhibitors, 32 patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEIs), and 89 patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The 
correlations in expression among these three receptors and the results of Oxford 
typing were analyzed, together with the ability of ACEIs and ARBs to reduce 
proteinuria and the effects of ARBs on AT1R and AT2R expression. The results 
showed significantly higher AT1R, AT2R, and MASR expression in the M1 group 
(mesangial score > 0.5) than in the M0 group (mesangial score < 0.5), 
significantly higher AT1R expression in the S1 group (presence of segmental 
glomerulosclerosis) than in the S0 group (absence of segmental 
glomerulosclerosis); AT1R expression in the C2 group (crescent formation > 25%) 
was significantly higher than in the C0 (crescent formation = 0) and C1 
(crescent formation < 25%) groups. Patients treated with an ARB for < 6 months 
had significantly lower urinary protein levels than those taking these drugs for 
> 6 months. These findings imply that overexpression of AT1R on the mesangial 
cells of IgAN patients is associated with mesangial cell proliferation, 
glomerular segmental sclerosis, and crescent formation. In addition, long-term 
administration of ARB may decrease the efficacy of these medications in terms of 
reducing proteinuria.

The Multi-Biomarker Disease Activity (MBDA) score is a validated rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) disease activity measure based on 12 serum biomarkers. Here, we 
evaluate short-term biological variability of MBDA scores to determine the 
magnitude of change that might be considered clinically meaningful. Twenty-eight 
adult seropositive RA patients with clinically stable disease and no changes in 
RA medications for 4 weeks prior to study were enrolled. Nine serum samples were 
obtained over four consecutive days (non-fasting). MBDA score variation was 
assessed day-to-day (daily) and within 24 h (diurnal). The standard deviation 
(SD) of MBDA scores was calculated by a linear mixed model including random 
effects for patient, day, and time of day. The minimally important difference 
(MID) was calculated as [Formula: see text]. A subgroup analysis was performed 
for patients with active RA (moderate or high MBDA score). The SD of MBDA score 
change in the full cohort was 4.7 in a combined daily-diurnal variation 
analysis, which corresponds with an MID of 11. The SD of MBDA score change in 
the subset of patients with active RA (moderate/high MBDA scores) was 3.6. This 
corresponds with an MID of 8 units in patients with active RA for whom 
clinicians are most likely to need guidance with respect to therapeutic 
decisions. Changes in MBDA score ≥ 8 represent a change in RA disease activity 
that clinicians can use as a benchmark for therapeutic drug efficacy and can be 
incorporated into a treat-to-target strategy.

In the distal radioulnar joint, the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is 
an important stabilizer and are frequently found in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) with wrist pain. This study was designed to predict TFCC tears 
using high-resolution ultrasound in severe RA. We retrospectively reviewed 
patients with severe RA. MRI and ultrasound were performed at baseline and after 
1 year of follow-up. TFCC tears were recorded. The predictive factors for TFCC 
tears were analyzed by logistic regression. During the 1-year follow-up period, 
54 patients were enrolled (42 females and 12 males), of whom 21 (38.9%) 
developed TFCC tears. The body mass index was 22.81±2.59 kg/m2 in the TFCC tear 
group compared with 23.61±2.76 kg/m2 in the non-tear group (p=0.136). The mean 
age was 55.14±9.54 years in the TFCC tear group compared with 56.45±14.04 years 
in the non-tear group (p=0.596). The tear group had a higher Disease Activity 
Score in 28 joints (DAS28) (6.36±0.47 vs 5.58±0.65, p=0.011) and higher power 
Doppler (PD) ultrasound score at the dorsal radiocarpal joint (1.90±1.30 vs 
1.33±0.99, p=0.011) than the non-tear group. We found that high DAS28 (OR 2.96, 
95% CI 1.95 to 4.50; p=0.001) and higher baseline PD score (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 
to 2.14; p=0.019) were significantly associated with a higher risk of TFCC tears 
by logistic regression. So we conclude a higher wrist PD score in severe RA 
predicted future TFCC tears. Therefore, we suggest to use PD score in such 
patients to monitor the risk of future TFCC tears.

BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a potential therapy for various 
diseases. Here, the results of intrathecal injection of MSCs in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) patients are reported.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients were enrolled in the study. Three were male 
and one was female. There were three secondary-progressive MS patients and one 
relapsing-remitting MS patient. An amount of 50-80 ml of bone marrow was 
collected from the patients. MSC cultures were collected for each 
microbiological examination at each change of medium and passage as well as at 
the time of sample injection. Then, MSCs were injected into the patients by the 
intrathecal method. In two patients, the injection was replicated in 1 year.
RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for 2 years. Three patients who had 
secondary progression did not show disease progress after the injection, and the 
disease entered a stable state. A degree of recovery was observed in two 
patients. The relapsing-remitting patient suffered an attack that led to 
corticosteroid injection. None of the patients reported side effects. In terms 
of magnetic resonance imaging, there were no new plaques or enhanced plaques.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that injection of MSC can be a suitable method, 
especially for secondary-progressive patients. It seems that reinjection of 
these stem cells can be safe and sustaining it positively increases the effects 
of this therapeutic approach.

damage in lesions and normal appearing gray and white matter in multiple 
sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting the human 
central nervous system (CNS) and leading to neurologic disability. Although 
conventional MRI techniques can readily detect focal white matter (WM) lesions, 
it remains challenging to quantify tissue damage in normal-appearing gray matter 
(GM) and WM.
PURPOSE: To demonstrate that a new MRI biomarker, R2t*, can provide quantitative 
analysis of tissue damage across the brain in MS patients in a single scan.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
SUBJECTS: Forty-four MS patients and 19 healthy controls (HC).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T, quantitative gradient-recalled-echo (qGRE), 
Magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery.
ASSESSMENT: Severity of tissue damage was assessed by reduced R2t*. Tissue 
atrophy was assessed by cortical thickness and cervical spinal cord 
cross-sectional area (CSA). Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite was used for 
clinical assessment.
RESULTS: R2t* in cortical GM was more sensitive to MS damage than cortical 
atrophy. Using more than two standard deviations (SD) reduction versus 
age-matched HC as the cutoff, 48% of MS patients showed lower R2t*, versus only 
9% with lower cortical thickness. Significant correlations between severities of 
tissue injury were identified among 1) upper cervical cord and several cortical 
regions, including motor cortex (P < 0.001), and 2) adjacent regions of GM and 
subcortical WM (P < 0.001). R2t*-defined tissue cellular damage in cortical GM 
was greater relative to adjacent WM. Reductions in cortical R2t* correlated with 
cognitive impairment (P < 0.01). Motor-related clinical signs correlated most 
with cervical cord CSA (P < 0.001).
DATA CONCLUSION: Reductions in R2t* within cortical GM was more sensitive to 
tissue damage than atrophy, potentially allowing a reduced sample size in 
clinical trials. R2t* together with structural morphometry suggested topographic 
patterns of regions showing correlated tissue damage throughout the brain and 
the cervical spinal cord of MS patients.

Growing evidence suggests that people with autoimmune conditions may be at 
increased risk of hepatobiliary tumors. In the present study, we evaluated 
associations between autoimmune conditions and hepatobiliary cancers among 
adults aged ≥66 in the United States. We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results (SEER)-Medicare data (1992-2013) to conduct a population-based, 
case-control study. Cases (n = 32,443) had primary hepatobiliary cancer. 
Controls (n = 200,000) were randomly selected, cancer-free adults 
frequency-matched to cases by sex, age and year of selection. Using 
multivariable logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with 39 autoimmune conditions 
identified via Medicare claims. We also conducted separate analyses for 
diagnoses obtained via inpatient versus outpatient claims. Sixteen conditions 
were associated with at least one hepatobiliary cancer. The strongest risk 
estimates were for primary biliary cholangitis with hepatocellular carcinoma 
(OR: 31.33 [95% CI: 23.63-41.56]) and primary sclerosing cholangitis with 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (7.53 [5.73-10.57]), extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (5.59 [4.03-7.75]), gallbladder cancer (2.06 [1.27-3.33]) and 
ampulla of Vater cancer (6.29 [4.29-9.22]). Associations with 
hepatobiliary-related conditions as a group were observed across nearly all 
cancer sites (ORs ranging from 4.53 [95% CI: 3.30-6.21] for extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma to 7.18 [5.94-8.67] for hepatocellular carcinoma). 
Restricting to autoimmune conditions diagnosed via inpatient claims, 6 
conditions remained associated with at least one hepatobiliary cancer, and 
several risk estimates increased. In the outpatient restricted analysis, 12 
conditions remained associated. Multiple autoimmune conditions are associated 
with hepatobiliary cancer risk in the US Medicare population, supporting a 
shared immuno-inflammatory etiology to these cancers.

AIM: The aim of this study was to describe how adolescents perceive the 
transition from being dependent on their parents to managing their own type 1 
diabetes.
DESIGN: An explorative design with a phenomenographic approach was used.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews took place during 2016-2017 with 18 
strategically sampled adolescents (7 boys and 11 girls, aged 16-18 years) with 
type 1 diabetes from five Norwegian paediatric diabetes centres.
FINDINGS: Three descriptive categories, each comprising three perceptions, 
emerged: (1) Taking responsibility for own diabetes is a process comprised 'It 
is natural to take over responsibility for own diabetes', 'Expectations from 
parents and healthcare personnel', and 'The adolescents want more independence'. 
(2) Taking responsibility for own diabetes was dependent on coping comprised 
'Feeling proud to handle their own diabetes', 'The transition is like a roller 
coaster', and 'Taking responsibility means that it is your fault if you make 
mistakes'. (3) It is demanding to take responsibility for own diabetes comprised 
'Taking responsibility for own diabetes requires knowledge and skills', 'It is 
time-consuming to take responsibility for own diabetes', and 'Having 
responsibility for own diabetes is like being examined every day'.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents want to take over the responsibility for their diabetes 
treatment from their parents, but they need knowledge, experience and skills to 
succeed. Parents, friends and health professionals are important supporters 
during the transition.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Health professionals need to know their patients 
to identify the adolescents' need for support. Self-care is considered essential 
in the management of diabetes. Education sessions are an important part of the 
transition to control own diabetes. Such education should also include parents 
and friends.

OBJECTIVE: Antibodies against posttranslationally modified proteins are a 
hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the emergence and pathogenicity of 
these autoantibodies are still incompletely understood. The aim of this study 
was to analyze the antigen specificities and mutation patterns of monoclonal 
antibodies (mAb) derived from RA synovial plasma cells and address the question 
of antigen cross-reactivity.
METHODS: IgG-secreting cells were isolated from RA synovial fluid, and the 
variable regions of the immunoglobulins were sequenced (n = 182) and expressed 
in full-length mAb (n = 93) and also as germline-reverted versions. The patterns 
of reactivity with 53,019 citrullinated peptides and 49,211 carbamylated 
peptides and the potential of the mAb to promote osteoclastogenesis were 
investigated.
RESULTS: Four unrelated anti-citrullinated protein autoantibodies (ACPAs), of 
which one was clonally expanded, were identified and found to be highly 
somatically mutated in the synovial fluid of a patient with RA. The ACPAs 
recognized >3,000 unique peptides modified by either citrullination or 
carbamylation. This highly multireactive autoantibody feature was replicated for 
Ig sequences derived from B cells from the peripheral blood of other RA 
patients. The plasma cell-derived mAb were found to target distinct amino acid 
motifs and partially overlapping protein targets. They also conveyed different 
effector functions as revealed in an osteoclast activation assay.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the high level of cross-reactivity among 
RA autoreactive B cells is the result of different antigen encounters, possibly 
at different sites and at different time points. This is consistent with the 
notion that RA is initiated in one context, such as in the mucosal organs, and 
thereafter targets other sites, such as the joints.

OBJECTIVE: Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe, 
lifelong, multisystem autoimmune disease. Long-term outcome data are limited. 
This study was undertaken to identify clinical characteristics and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adults with childhood-onset SLE.
METHODS: Patients participated in a single study visit comprising a structured 
history and physical examination. Disease activity (scored using the SLE Disease 
Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K]), damage (scored using the Systemic Lupus 
International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage 
Index [SDI]), and HRQoL (scored using the Short Form 36 Health Survey) were 
assessed. Medical records were reviewed.
RESULTS: In total, 111 childhood-onset SLE patients were included; the median 
disease duration was 20 years, 91% of patients were female, and 72% were white. 
Disease activity was low (median SLEDAI-2K score 4), and 71% of patients 
received prednisone, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and/or other disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs. The vast majority of new childhood-onset SLE-related 
manifestations developed within 2 years of diagnosis. Damage such as myocardial 
infarctions began occurring after 5 years. Most patients (62%) experienced 
damage, predominantly in the musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, and renal 
systems. Cerebrovascular accidents, renal transplants, replacement 
arthroplasties, and myocardial infarctions typically occurred at a young age 
(median age 20 years, 24 years, 34 years, and 39 years, respectively). 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that damage accrual was 
associated with disease duration (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, P < 0.001), 
antiphospholipid antibody positivity (OR 3.56, P = 0.026), and hypertension (OR 
3.21, P = 0.043). Current HCQ monotherapy was associated with an SDI score of 0 
(OR 0.16, P = 0.009). In this cohort, HRQoL was impaired compared to the overall 
Dutch population. The presence of damage reduced HRQoL scores in 1 domain. High 
disease activity (SLEDAI-2K score ≥8) and changes in physical appearance 
strongly reduced HRQoL scores (in 4 of 8 domains and 7 of 8 domains, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: The majority of adults with childhood-onset SLE in this large cohort 
developed significant damage at a young age and had impaired HRQoL without 
achieving drug-free remission, illustrating the substantial impact of 
childhood-onset SLE on future life.

OBJECTIVE: Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) develop many years 
before the clinical onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was 
undertaken to address the molecular basis of the specificity and 
cross-reactivity of ACPAs from patients with RA.
METHODS: Antibodies isolated from RA patients were expressed as monoclonal 
chimeric antibodies with mouse Fc. These antibodies were characterized for 
glycosylation using mass spectrometry, and their cross-reactivity was assessed 
using Biacore and Luminex immunoassays. The crystal structures of the 
antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the monoclonal ACPA E4 in complex with 3 
different citrullinated peptides were determined using x-ray crystallography. 
The prevalence of autoantibodies reactive against 3 of the citrullinated 
peptides that also interacted with E4 was investigated by Luminex immunoassay in 
2 Swedish cohorts of RA patients.
RESULTS: Analysis of the crystal structures of a monoclonal ACPA from human RA 
serum in complex with citrullinated peptides revealed key residues of several 
complementarity-determining regions that recognized the citrulline as well as 
the neighboring peptide backbone, but with limited contact with the side chains 
of the peptides. The same citrullinated peptides were recognized by high titers 
of serum autoantibodies in 2 large cohorts of RA patients.
CONCLUSION: These data show, for the first time, how ACPAs derived from human RA 
serum recognize citrulline. The specific citrulline recognition and 
backbone-mediated interactions provide a structural explanation for the 
promiscuous recognition of citrullinated peptides by RA-specific ACPAs.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by 
immune-mediated inflammation, which attacks the myelin sheath. MS pursues a 
relapsing and remitting course with varying intervals between symptoms. The main 
clinical pathological features include inflammation, myelin sheath destruction 
and plaque formation in the central nervous system (CNS). We previously reported 
that cystatin F (CysF) expression is induced in demyelinating lesions that are 
accompanied by active remyelination (referred to as shadow plaques) but is 
down-regulated in chronic demyelinated lesions (plaques) in the spinal cord of 
MS patients and in several murine models of demyelinating disease. CysF is a 
cathepsin protease inhibitor whose major target is cathepsin C (CatC), which is 
co-expressed in demyelinating regions in Plp4e/- mice, a model of chronic 
demyelination. Here, we report the time course of CatC and CysF expression and 
describe the symptoms in a mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 
model using CatC knockdown (KD) and CatC over-expression (OE) mice. In myelin 
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-EAE, CatC positive cells were found to 
infiltrate the CNS at an early stage prior to any clinical signs, in comparison 
to WT mice. CysF expression was not observed at this early stage, but appeared 
later within shadow plaques. CatC expression was found in chronic demyelinated 
lesions but was not associated with CysF expression, and CatCKD EAE mouse showed 
delayed demyelination. Whereas, CatCOE in microglia significantly increased 
severity of demyelination in the MOG-EAE model. Thus, these results demonstrate 
that CatC plays a major role in MOG-EAE.

We present a case of a novel PAX6 heterozygous mutation with aniridia and 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first case of its mutation with a complete loss of insulin secretory capacity. 
We believe that our letter will add new knowledge to diabetes mellitus 
associated with PAX6 mutations and might help us to understand the role of PAX6 
in beta-cell development.

OBJECTIVE: In multiple sclerosis (MS), deep grey matter (DGM) atrophy has been 
recognised as a crucial component of the disease that presents early and it has 
been associated with disability. Although the precise mechanism underlying grey 
matter atrophy is unknown, several hypotheses have been postulated. Our previous 
research pointed to correlations of hypothalamic metabolic alterations with 
clinical outcomes of MS, therefore we decided to further test the relationship 
of these alterations with DGM atrophy.
METHODS: We used 1H-Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the hypothalamus 
to test its metabolites in 26 patients with RRMS and 22 healthy age-matched 
controls. DGM atrophy was evaluated by simple planimetry of third ventricular 
width on the hypothalamic level (3VW) in T1 weighted MRI pictures. Metabolite 
ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), glutamate and glutamine 
(Glx), myo-inositol (mIns) and creatine (Cr) were correlated with Multiple 
Sclerosis Severity Scale (MSSS) and 3VW.
RESULTS: Metabolite concentrations were compared between patients and controls 
using multiple regression models allowing for age, 3VW and metabolites. It 
revealed that the only relevant predictors of MSSS were 3VW and Glx/NAA. At a 
significance level of P<0.05, a unit increase of 3VW was associated with a 0.35 
increase of MSSS, for a typical value of Glx/NAA; P value 0.0039. A unit 
increase of Glx/NAA was associated with a 0.93 increase of MSSS, for a typical 
value of atrophy; P value 0.090. There were significant linear correlations 
between Glx/Cr and MSSS, Glx/NAA and MSSS, and between mIns/NAA and 3VW.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that both NAA and Glx are associated with 
neurodegeneration of hypothalamic DGM and severe disease course. Glx related 
1H-MRS parameters seem to be superior to other metabolites in determining 
disease burden, independently of otherwise powerful 3VW planimetry. 
Significantly increased mIns/NAA in MS patients compared to controls point to 
gliosis, which parallels the atrophy of hypothalamic DGM.

OBJECTIVES: The immune system has an important role in the development of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and chronic periodontitis (CP). Altered 
cytokines levels characterise both diseases and contributes to periodontal 
tissue damage in CP and to macrocomplexes deposition with connective tissue 
destruction in SLE. This study aimed to evaluate the production of salivary 
cytokines in patients with SLE and its association with periodontal status.
METHODS: The sample comprised 70 SLE patients and 70 paired controls. SLE 
activity and damage were scored using Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease 
Activity Index 2000 and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating 
Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index. Subjects were classified 
as without or with CP. Salivary concentrations of IL-33, MMP2/TIMP2, RANK and 
OPG were measured by ELISA, while IL-2, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17A 
were determined by Cytometric Bead Array. Linear regression models analysed 
association among SLE, CP and salivary cytokines.
RESULTS: IL-6 and IL-17A concentrations were significantly higher in SLE/CP 
patients than controls/CP. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-17A and IL-33 were 
increased in SLE/CP individuals when compared to SLE without CP. Multivariate 
model revealed association of cumulative dose of corticoids with periodontal 
damage and of IL-33 salivary concentration with SLE activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that long-term therapy with corticoids would 
contribute with periodontal destruction in SLE patients. Moreover, the increased 
levels of IL-6, IL-17A and IL-33 in saliva of SLE subjects with CP may signal it 
as possible inflammatory pathways in this process.

OBJECTIVES: Informed consent (IC) is an ethical process required in human 
subject research. Primary objective was to determine factors associated to poor 
knowledge of IC content (PK) in patients from an early rheumatoid arthritis 
cohort.
METHODS: The cohort initiated in 2004, had assistant and research purposes 
(NCT03389711). At inclusion, each patient selected 1 of 4 options of the IC 
form; options ranged from broad consent (patient's data could be used for 
research) to patient denied to have his/her data used. Once enrolled, patients 
had regular assessments. Up to May 2017, the cohort had 146 patients with 
(median, range) follow-up of 8.8 years, (4.3-11.9) and 143 agreed to participate 
in a cross-sectional study; patients had scheduled rheumatic evaluations; 
additionally, a social worker applied a questionnaire that addressed objective 
described. PK was established by the borderline performance method. Multiple 
regression models were applied to investigate factors associated to PK.
RESULTS: At cohort inclusion, patients were primarily middle-aged (38.3±13.1 
years) females (88.9%), with high disease activity (DAS28: 5.8 [4.6-6.8)] and 
poor quality of life (SF-36: 42 [29-59]). All the patients gave broad IC. At 
study entry, 35-41.3% of them had PK; longer follow-up and lower SF-36 scores at 
cohort inclusion, were associated to PK. In addition, 79.7% of the patients had 
DAS28-remission and 67.1% had SF-36 scores within normal range; interestingly, 
only 49% of the patients considered broad re-consent and these patients had 
poorer SF-36 emotional subscore than their counterpart (79±23 vs. 87±1, p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Poor quality of life impacts the autonomy of RA patients.

OBJECTIVES: Adipokines play an important role in the pathophysiology of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), provide a link between the disease and overweight, 
contributing to explain the enhanced cardiovascular (CV) risk and influence the 
response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The aim of this study was to 
determine the possible effects of intravenous (IV) tocilizumab (TCZ), an 
interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, on serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, 
resistin, visfatin, and chemerin.
METHODS: Forty-four RA patients with active disease (DAS28-ESR ≥3.2) were 
treated with IV TCZ (8 mg/kg) once every 4 weeks for six months: 20 patients 
received TCZ as monotherapy and 24 in association with methotrexate (MTX). At 
baseline and monthly, before each infusion, body mass index, DAS28-ESR and 
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) were recorded. The laboratory parameters, 
including the adipokines serum levels were collected at baseline and after six 
months.
RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up, ESR, CRP, DAS28-ESR and HAQ resulted 
significantly improved in patients received TCZ as monotherapy or combined with 
MTX. Lipid profile showed only a significant increase of total cholesterol. A 
significant reduction of chemerin and an increase of adiponectin were observed 
in the whole population and in the subgroups of the patients analysed (TCZ mono 
or combined therapy) without any significant correlations with clinical and 
biochemical parameters. No changes in the leptin and resistin levels were 
detected.
CONCLUSIONS: TCZ is able to regulate serum levels of chemerin and adiponectin in 
RA patients, independently of the disease treatment response, which contributes 
to explain the CV safety of TCZ.

AIMS: Incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is increasing worldwide. We 
aimed to study trends in presentation and incidence of childhood diabetes in the 
last 15years in south-western Iran.
METHODS: During a detailed review of compiled records of the main tertiary 
children's hospital of southwest of Iran, from January 2000 to December 2009, 
the following clinical information relevant to diabetes were analysed: 
admissions, demographic data, clinical and laboratory findings, hospital course, 
and mortality. Study continued 5years more to find out the real rate of 
increase. Significant findings with respect to the incidence of DKA, gender and 
age of subjects were summarized from among these cases. A total of 297 (known 
and new) cases were enrolled in the 1st (10year) stage of study and 691 new 
subjects in the 2nd (5year) period to check the trend in the whole 15year study 
period.
RESULTS: In the 1st period; excluding 129 repeated admissions, 297 cases were 
enrolled for analysis: 223 new and 74 known cases. Among the new cases, 67.3% 
presented with DKA, without any gender bias. Mortality rate in DKA subjects was 
4% with higher risk in the <2year group and in girls (boy: girl=1:7; p=0.039). 
Adding the 2nd study period (total 15years) disclosed a rapid rise of incidence 
(new cases/5year) as 89, 134 and 691 new diabetes cases for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd 
5year period of study respectively. The final annual incidence for <15year age 
group in 2015 was 13.35/100000.
CONCLUSIONS: The most new cases of T1DM presented with DKA, which is similar to 
the other developing countries. Such an increasing incidence of DM proposes more 
attention for periodic retraining of families and health staff to earlier 
diagnosis and management of new subjects, and to reduce morbidity and mortality 
rates.

Early diagnosis and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) is crucial for 
preventing ischemic complications. Multiple serological markers have been 
identified; however, there is a distinct lack of predicting markers for GCA 
relapse and complications. Our main objective was to identify serological 
parameters in a large cohort of treatment-naïve GCA patients, which could 
support clinicians in evaluating the course of the disease. Clinical data was 
gathered, along with analyte detection using Luminex technology, ELISA, and 
nephelometry, among others. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal 
component analysis of analyte profiles were performed to determine delineation 
of GCA patients and healthy blood donors (HBDs). Highest, significantly elevated 
analytes in GCA patients were SAA (83-fold > HBDs median values), IL-23 
(58-fold), and IL-6 (11-fold). Importantly, we show for the first time 
significantly changed levels of MARCO, alpha-fetoprotein, protein C, resistin, 
TNC, TNF RI, M-CSF, IL-18, and IL-31 in GCA versus HBDs. Changes in levels of 
SAA, CRP, haptoglobin, ESR, MMP-1 and MMP-2, and TNF-alpha were found associated 
with relapse and visual disturbances. aCL IgG was associated with limb artery 
involvement, even following adjustment for multiple testing. Principal component 
analysis revealed clear delineation between HBDs and GCA patients. Our study 
reveals biomarker clusters in a large cohort of patients with GCA and emphasizes 
the importance of using groups of serological biomarkers, such as acute phase 
proteins, MMPs, and cytokines (e.g. TNF-alpha) that could provide crucial 
insight into GCA complications and progression, leading to a more personalized 
disease management.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic immune-mediated liver 
injury caused by dysregulated immune response to liver antigens. Genetic 
susceptibility is affected by multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
immune-related genes. There are few reports on the association of TGF-β and 
IL-10 genetic variants with autoimmune hepatitis.
METHODS: Allele frequency and genotype status of IL-10 -1082, -819, -592 and 
TGF-β +869 and +915 polymorphisms were investigated in 57 unrelated patients 
with autoimmune hepatitis and 140 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction 
with sequence-specific primers.
RESULTS: IL-10 -592 and -819 allele frequencies and genotypes were not 
associated with autoimmune hepatitis in our population, while IL-10 -1082 
genotypes were. IL-10 -1082/-819/-592 "high-producing" haplotype GCC was 
significantly less frequent in patients. TGF-β +869 "high-producing" allele C 
and genotype CC were significantly more in autoimmune hepatitis, compared to 
controls; whereas, TGF-β +915 "low-producing" allele C and genotype CC were 
significantly more in autoimmune hepatitis compared to control. TGF-β +869/+915 
haplotype TG was significantly less frequent in patients while CC haplotype was 
significantly more frequently observed in patients.
CONCLUSION: We identified a significant association between IL-10 -1082/-819 and 
TGF-β +869/+915 genotypes and haplotypes with autoimmune hepatitis in Iranians.

Several case reports and cohort studies have recently investigated the potential 
association between bullous pemphigoid (BP) and psoriasis. It has been 
speculated that chronic inflammation in the dermo-epidermal junction can trigger 
exposure to antigens to autoreactive T cells, resulting in autoimmune blistering 
disease. However, the association described has been inconsistently reported 
amongst studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
investigation this potential association. We identified four case-control 
studies for inclusion in the present meta-analysis, with a total of 4035 bullous 
pemphigoid cases and 19 215 control cases. There was a significantly higher 
prevalence of psoriasis in BP compared to controls (2.6% vs 1.1%, OR 2.5, 95% CI 
1.4-4.6). Subgroup analysis showed that this association remained significant in 
both males (3.0% vs 1.3%, OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.6) as well as females (1.9% vs 
0.7%, OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-5.9). A significantly higher proportion of cases were 
reported in males (3.0% vs 1.9%, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.1-2.7). This pooled analysis 
of existing case-control studies to date demonstrates a significant association 
between BP and psoriasis. We also showed that in contrast with the majority of 
autoimmune diseases which are predisposed in females, that the coexistence of BP 
and psoriasis appears to be predisposed in male patients.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare autoimmune bullous disease which affects the 
skin and mucous membranes. Oesophageal involvement is rare and has previously 
been limited to case reports and case series. A recent large case series of 477 
PV patients showed that 26/477 (5.4%) had symptomatic oesophageal involvement. 
We present the case of a 54-year-old Somalian lady with a 10-year history of 
cutaneous PV, currently in remission, who developed dysphagia and odynophagia 
and was subsequently found to have oesophageal PV involvement with multiple 
flaccid bullae which were positive for anti-DSG3 antibodies on in-direct 
immunofluorescence. She had her treatment switched from azathioprine to 
mycophenolate and prednisolone, leading to resolution of her symptoms.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Although patient self-efficacy is known to affect adherence 
to therapy, no available tool measures self-efficacy of insulin therapy 
administration while addressing the entire therapeutic process and management. 
In light of this, we developed the 'Insulin Therapy Self-efficacy Scale (ITSS).'
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Development of the ITSS involved three phases: (i) item 
generation and creation of a questionnaire draft; (ii) testing and correcting 
the items through interviews with patients; and (iii) a multicenter, single-arm 
study to validate the questionnaire.
RESULTS: A factor analysis and Cronbach's α both confirmed good internal 
consistency in the patients' confidence regarding the following four factors: 
the insulin injection procedure, insulin titration, glycemic control and ability 
to cope with hypoglycemia. Reproducibility was confirmed using weighted κ 
statistics and intraclass correlations. Good concurrent validity was confirmed 
with two other questionnaires. The ITSS score was also found to correlate with 
several patient characteristics and clinical parameters, as well as with a 
better adherence to injected insulin therapy 6 months later, suggesting the 
predictive validity of this scale.
CONCLUSIONS: The ITSS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing and quantifying 
patients' self-efficacy. The ITSS estimation of self-efficacy can predict a 
patient's glycemic control and future adherence to insulin therapy. These 
characteristics will ensure the usefulness of the ITSS in ensuring a successful 
therapeutic process for patients and physicians.

The triple stimulation technique (TST) was rarely used in multiple sclerosis 
(MS). This study aimed to compare TST and motor evoked potentials (MEP) for the 
quantification of motor dysfunction. Central motor conduction based on MEP (four 
limbs) and TST (upper limbs) was assessed in 28 MS patients with a median 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 4. EDSS, timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 
grasping strength and motor components of the MS functional composite were 
evaluated. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between MEP, 
TST and clinical findings. TST was negatively correlated with EDSS (r = - 0.74, 
p < 0.0001) and to a lesser extent with T25FW (r = - 0.47, p < 0.05), and 
grasping strength (r = - 0.43, p < 0.05). A multiple regression analysis 
underlined the better correlation between clinical data and TST (R2 = 0.56, 
p < 0.0005) than with MEP (0.03 < R2 < 0.22, p > 0.05). This study evidenced the 
value of TST as a quantification tool of motor dysfunction. TST appeared to 
reflect a global disability since it was correlated not only to hand function 
but also to walking capacity.

Exosome-encapsulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as potential 
biomarkers in autoimmune diseases. However, little is known about the role of 
exosome-delivered miRNAs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we 
investigated the profile of specific exosomal miRNAs by microarray analysis of 
serum exosomes from three patients with RA and three healthy 
controls. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the 
aberrantly expressed exosomal miRNAs. A total of 20 exosome-encapsulated miRNAs 
were identified to be differently expressed in the serum of patients with RA 
compared with controls. Interestingly, we found that exosome-encapsulated 
miR-6089 was significantly decreased after validation by qRT-PCR in serum 
exosomes from 76 patients with RA and 20 controls. Besides, miR-6089 could 
inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cell proliferation and activation of 
macrophage-like THP-1 cells. TLR4 was a direct target for miR-6089. MiR-6089 
regulated the generation of IL-6, IL-29, and TNF-α by targetedly controlling 
TLR4 signaling. In conclusion, exosome-encapsulated miR-6089 regulates 
LPS/TLR4-mediated inflammatory response, which may serve as a novel, promising

AIMS: The aim of the study was to evaluate Facebook group as possible 
communication tool to improve glucose control in adolescents and young people 
with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional study included 728 T1D patients 
(age 11-25) on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily 
injections (MDI) treated at the center for insulin pump and glucose sensor in 
Skopje from January 2012 to December 2017. Data were collected through the 
electronic medical record system and cross-sectional analysis (telephone, social 
media (Facebook and Viber) or email). Patients were analyzed in two groups: (a) 
non-Internet group, with 398 patients treated using standard medical protocol 
with regular clinic visits; (b) Internet group, with 330 patients who, besides 
standard medical protocol, were active members of a national closed Facebook 
group on diabetes. Both the non-Internet and Internet groups had regular visits 
every 2-3 months. Patients from the Internet group were members of the closed 
Facebook group "Diabetes Macedonia" and had an opportunity to interact with 
questions, answers, and comments on diabetes care. An additional analysis was 
performed of the Internet group on combined use of Facebook and Viber. Average 
HbA1c levels were compared in both groups.
RESULTS: Each patient from the Facebook group had 1.5 ± 3.5 posts per day. Hba1c 
was significantly lower in patients from the Internet group (7.1 ± 3.2%; 54 ± 35 
mmol/mol) compared to patients from the non-Internet group (7.6 ± 2.8%; 60 ± 31 
mmol/mol).
CONCLUSIONS: Social media like Facebook and Viber can be additional 
communication tool in adolescents and young people with T1D and can 
significantly lower HbA1c compared to patients without social media use. CSII 
patients are more likely to use both social media (Facebook and Viber) compared 
with MDI patients (Facebook only).

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of 
vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia. Endothelial dysfunction has 
been well documented in other types of vasculitis but not in EGPA. Thirty 
patients (10 men and 20 women) diagnosed with EGPA and remaining in a remission, 
and 58 controls (24 men and 34 women) matched for age, sex, and body mass index, 
were enrolled in the study. We assessed each participants for typical risk 
factors of cardiovascular diseases and measured serum levels of vascular cell 
adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and thrombomodulin. We also 
measured flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and intima-media 
thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery using ultrasonography. Patients 
with EGPA had 20% higher serum level of VCAM-1 (p < 0.001) and 41.9% of 
thrombomodulin (p < 0.001). They also had 38.8% lower relative increase of FMD 
(FMD%) (p < 0.001), indicating endothelial dysfunction. These differences 
remained significant also after adjustment for potential confounders. Laboratory 
and ultrasonographic parameters of endothelial injury were correlated to the 
markers of inflammation and impaired kidney function. Determinants of lower FMD% 
in a simple regression model were pack-years of smoking (β = - 0.3 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) - 0.5 to - 0.1]), serum level of IL-6 (β = - 0.36 [95% 
CI - 0.62 to - 0.1]), and thrombomodulin (β = - 0.34 [95% CI - 0.6 to - 0.08]). 
EGPA patients are characterized by inflammatory endothelial injury that is 
likely related to the pathogenesis of the disease. Proper immunosuppressive 
treatment is the best method to prevent atherosclerosis and future 
cardiovascular events, the patients may also benefit from additional preventive 
interventions.

miRNAs are noncoding RNA that play a critical role as fine regulators of gene 
expression at the posttranscriptional level within cells in numerous autoimmune 
diseases. miR-221/222 play a role in cancer by regulating cell proliferation, 
invasion and apoptosis. However, there have been insufficient studies on their 
role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This work is designed to analyze the 
miR-221/222 expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 
patients with RA in comparison with healthy controls using quantitative RT-PCR, 
in a group of 30 RA patients and 20 healthy controls. The fold change of 
miR-221/222 expression in PBMCs was significantly elevated (p < 0.01) in RA 
patients compared with healthy controls. A positive correlation between 
expression levels of miR-221 and miR-222 was recorded (r = 0.303; p < 0.05). 
High miR-221/222 expression levels appeared to be elevated with high activity. 
miR-222 expression in high activity group of RA patients was significantly 
increased in relation to moderate (p < 0.01) and low (p < 0.001) activity ones 
with positive correlation (r = 0.363; p < 0.05) between the progress of disease 
activity and change in miR-222 expression level. ROC analysis showed a 
sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 75% for miR-221. In miR-222, the 
sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 70% were recorded. Our data shed some 
light on the role of miR-221/222 expression in RA patients, and their great 
potential value as new novel noninvasive biomarkers for disease detection. 
Therefore; further investigations are warranted to fully elucidate their role in 
rheumatoid.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease that 
affects approximately 2.5 million people globally. Even though the etiology of 
MS remains unknown, it is accepted that it involves a combination of genetic 
alterations and environmental factors. Here, after performing whole exome 
sequencing, we found a MS patient harboring a rare and homozygous single 
nucleotide variant (SNV; rs61745847) of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) 
galanin-receptor 2 (GALR2) that alters an important amino acid in the TM6 
molecular toggle switch region (W249L). Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging 
showed that the hypothalamus (an area rich in GALR2) of this patient exhibited 
an important volumetric reduction leading to an enlarged third ventricle. Ex 
vivo experiments with patient-derived blood cells (AKT phosphorylation), as well 
as studies in recombinant cell lines expressing the human GALR2 (calcium 
mobilization and NFAT mediated gene transcription), showed that galanin (GAL) 
was unable to stimulate cell signaling in cells expressing the variant GALR2 
allele. Live cell confocal microscopy showed that the GALR2 mutant receptor was 
primarily localized to intracellular endosomes. We conclude that the W249L SNV 
is likely to abrogate GAL-mediated signaling through GALR2 due to the 
spontaneous internalization of this receptor in this patient. Although this 
homozygous SNV was rare in our MS cohort (1:262 cases), our findings raise the 
potential importance of impaired neuroregenerative pathways in the pathogenesis 
of MS, warrant future studies into the relevance of the GAL/GALR2 axis in MS and 
further suggest the activation of GALR2 as a potential therapeutic route for 
this disease.

We report on a 15-year-old girl with severe anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
encephalitis who had initial poor prognostic factors. We delineate the unique 
challenges faced in the rehabilitation of our patient including sleep disruption 
and food aversion. After 20 months of hospitalization and intensive 
rehabilitation, there was a significant improvement in functional abilities and 
self-care skills. However, she had residual neurocognitive deficits, visual 
perceptual, and motor coordination difficulties that continued to improve after 
discharge, attesting to the need for long-term rehabilitation. The case showed 
the need for a coordinated multidisciplinary approach, with both targeted 
therapies and neuropharmacology, tailored to facilitate the different stages of 
recovery unique to anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis patients.

OBJECTIVE: With the rising incidence of Type 1 diabetes (T1DM), it is important 
to recognize deficiencies in care and areas of improvement to provide better 
access to resources and education for T1DM patients. The objective of this study 
was to recognize social factors and compliance barriers affecting glycated 
hemoglobin (A1c) level in T1D patients among the minority population.
METHODS: A total of 84 T1DM patients, ages 3 to 21 years, 49% males, 87% African 
American participated in the study. Study questionnaires assessing patient 
knowledge and other variables were distributed and patient charts were reviewed 
retrospectively to obtain relevant clinical data. T-tests, one-way ANOVA and 
spearman correlation were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Mean A1c in our study was 10.5% and mean knowledge score was 10.1 out 
of 14. There was no significant correlation (r = 0.12, p = 0.26) between A1c and 
patients' knowledge scores. Patients with more frequent blood sugar (BS) 
monitoring (3-4 times/day) had 2 points lower A1c (9.6 vs 11.6 %, 95% CI 
0.2-3.7, p = 0.03) than those with 2 or less times/day. No significant 
difference in A1c between 3-4 checks/day vs >4 checks/day BS checks. Most 
patients reported 'forgetfulness' (19%) followed by 'too time consuming' (17.9%) 
as barriers to daily BS monitoring. There was no significant difference in A1c 
between pen or pump users (10.5 vs 10.2 %, p = 0.55). Surprisingly, those with 
home supervision had higher A1c than those without (10.7 vs 9.6 %, p = 0.04) 
while there was no significant difference between those with or without nurse 
supervision at school (10.6 vs 9.8 %, p = 0.33). Those reporting happy mood 
interestingly had higher A1c than those with sad/depressed mood (10.7 vs 9.4 %, 
p = 0.04). On multiple linear regression analysis, frequency of BS checks, home 
supervision and mood were the most significant predictors of A1c and altogether 
explained 20% of the variability in A1c.
CONCLUSION: Frequent BS monitoring is associated with lower A1c. Supervision at 
home and school did not improve A1c, but it was self-reported information. Mood 
did not affect A1c contrary to that reported in other studies.

A seven-months-old girl under treatment for pneumonia presented with generalized 
edema, decreased urinary output and was found to have hypertension, 
muco-cutaneous fungal infection and pulmonary hypertension. Investigations 
revealed that she had heavy proteinuria, hypertriglyceridemia, hypoalbuminemia 
and elevated levels of free T3 and T4 with suppression of TSH levels in the 
serum. A diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) in thyrotoxic phase was made 
on the basis of clinical presentation and presence of anti-TPO antibodies and 
reduced uptake in thyroid (technetium) scintigraphy. The child responded to 
carbimazole therapy and propranolol. The case is presented to remind 
pediatricians about the rare occurrence of auto-immune thyroiditis in infancy 
with rare complications such as nephrotic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension.

CONTEXT: Cathepsin S (CTSS) activity is elevated in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) 
patient tears.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal expression of tear and tissue CTSS activity 
relative to other disease indicators in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice.
METHODS: CTSS activity was measured in tears and lacrimal glands (LG) from male 
1-6 month (M) NOD and 1 and 6 M BALB/c mice. Lymphocytic infiltration was 
quantified by histopathology, while disease-related proteins (Rab3D, CTSS, 
collagen 1) were quantified using q-PCR and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: In NOD LG, lymphocytic infiltration was noted by 2 M and established by 
3 M (p < 0.01). IFN-ɣ, TNF-α, and MHC II expression were increased by 2 M 
(p < 0.01). Tear CTSS activity was significantly elevated at 2 M (p < 0.001) to 
a maximum of 10.1-fold by 6 M (p < 0.001). CTSS activity in LG lysates was 
significantly elevated by 2 M (p < 0.001) to a maximum of 14-fold by 3 M 
(p < 0.001). CTSS and Rab3D immunofluorescence were significantly increased and 
decreased maximally in LG acini by 3 M and 2 M, respectively. Comparable changes 
were not detected between 1 and 6 M BALB/c mouse LG, although Collagen 1 was 
decreased by 6 M in LG of both strains.
CONCLUSION: Tear CTSS activity is elevated with other early disease indicators, 
suggesting potential as an early stage biomarker for SS.

The goal of this investigation was to examine clinical translation of glucose 
responsiveness of MK-2640, which is a novel insulin saccharide conjugate that 
can bind the insulin receptor or mannose receptor C type 1 (MRC1), the latter 
dependent upon glucose concentration. In a rising dose study in 36 healthy 
adults under euglycemic clamp conditions, rising exposures revealed saturation 
of MK-2640 clearance, likely due to saturation of clearance by MRC1. Potency of 
MK-2640 was ~25-fold reduced relative to regular human insulin. In a randomized, 
2-period crossover trial in 16 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus to 
evaluate glucose-responsiveness of i.v. administered MK-2640, we were unable to 
demonstrate a glucose-dependent change in MK-2640 clearance, although a 
significant glucose-dependent augmentation of glucose infusion rate was 
observed. These pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data provide 
crucial insights into next steps for developing an insulin saccharide conjugate 
as a clinically effective glucose-responsive insulin analog.

A kidney biopsy is done to determine the etiology of the glomerulonephritis (GN) 
and the severity of the lesion, to identify whether other lesions, related to or 
not related to the GN, are present on the kidney biopsy and finally to ascertain 
the extent of chronicity of the GN. The etiology of GN is based on the 
classification of GN into five groups: immune complex-mediated GN, 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated GN, anti-glomerular 
basement membrane (GBM) GN, monoclonal immunoglobulin-mediated GN and C3 
glomerulopathy. Immune complex GN includes multiple specific diseases such as 
lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, infection-related GN and fibrillary GN. ANCA 
GN, anti-GBM GN and C3 glomerulopathy are specific diseases in themselves, while 
monoclonal Ig GN includes proliferative GN with monoclonal Ig deposits and 
monoclonal Ig deposition disease. Thus identification of the class of GN and 
within it the specific disease determines the etiology of GN. Ancillary studies 
may be required to confirm the etiology of GN. The severity of the GN is 
revealed by the pattern of injury, such as crescentic, necrotizing, diffuse 
proliferative, exudative, membranoproliferative, mesangial proliferative or a 
sclerosing GN. Secondary diagnosis either related or unrelated to the GN, such 
as diabetic glomerulosclerosis, acute tubular necrosis or thrombotic 
microangiopathy, may also be present. The secondary diagnosis may sometimes be 
the reason for the kidney biopsy. The chronicity of GN is determined by 
evaluating the extent of glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial 
fibrosis and vascular sclerosis present on the biopsy. This review summarizes

Minnesota, U.S.A.

PURPOSE: The authors aimed to determine key features of IgG4-related ophthalmic 
disease (IgG4-ROD) and Graves orbitopathy (GO) to aid in diagnosis.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively identified ophthalmology patients seen 
between June 2009 and November 2013 with clinical overlap of GO and IgG4-ROD. 
Patient findings were reviewed to characterize the 2 conditions.
RESULTS: Among 8 patients (7 male and 1 female), the mean age was 45.8 years. 
Time between diagnoses of GO and IgG4-ROD ranged from 1 month to 8 years. 
Imaging showed enlarged extraocular muscles in all patients. Enlarged 
infraorbital nerves were seen in 4 patients. Tissue biopsy showed CD20+ 
lymphocytes with a large proportion of IgG4 plasma cells in 7 of 8 orbital 
specimens. Six patients had a ratio of IgG4:IgG cells >40%.
DISCUSSION: No pathognomonic clinical findings for GO or IgG4-ROD have been 
reported, but some key features can help distinguish the conditions. GO is 
likely if findings include increased thyrotropin receptor antibodies, lid 
retraction/lid lag, and enlarged extraocular muscles with typical tendon-sparing 
morphology. Findings suggestive of IgG4-ROD include history of asthma and 
progressive orbital disease in patients with previous diagnosis of GO, 
disproportionately large lateral rectus muscle, and enlarged infraorbital 
nerves. Increased serum IgG4 level and biopsy showing >10 IgG4+ plasma 
cells/high-power field and IgG4:IgG ratio >40% will support the diagnosis of 
IgG4-ROD.
CONCLUSIONS: GO and IgG4-ROD are complicated inflammatory processes affecting 
the orbit and present diagnostic challenges. The authors recommend biopsy for 
patients who do not follow the usual clinical course of GO or have clinical 
characteristics of IgG4-ROD.

CONTEXT: Excessive weight is a health problem that can exacerbate multiple 
sclerosis (MS) symptoms and its associated comorbidities such as depression and 
fatigue. In addition, weight may be a moderator of exercise effects on 
depression and fatigue symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of exercise training on 
fatigue and depression in normal and overweight individuals with MS.
METHODS: Sixty-six persons with MS were randomly assigned into an exercise or 
control condition based on body weight status (overweight vs. normal weight). 
The exercise conditions involved 8-weeks of interval exercise at 60%-75% 
Wattpeak, while the control condition did not involve any exercise. Fatigue, 
depression, aerobic capacity, time up and go (TUG) and body mass index were 
measured before and following the 8-week period.
RESULTS: There were no significant relationship's revealed for weight status 
interactions for any of the variables examined. There were significant condition 
main effects for fatigue, depression, aerobic capacity and TUG, and significant 
improvements were noted for the exercise conditions, but not in the 
non-exercising control group.
CONCLUSION: The results from this study confirm that exercise is an effective 
therapeutic intervention for improving fatigue, depression and functional 
parameters, independent of initial weight status, in persons with MS.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have shown that sclerostin, which is a negative 
regulator of bone formation, could play an important role in the crosstalk 
between bone and glucose metabolism. The role of sclerostin and its link with 
glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) has not been yet studied 
extensively in children. The aim of this study was to assess sclerostin and its 
relationship between other bone and fat related factors as well as glucose 
metabolism in children and adolescents with T1D in comparison to their healthy 
peers.
METHODS: Forty patients with T1D, 18 girls, mean age 12.3 ± 4.7 yrs, and 28 
healthy as controls (13.1 ± 4.2 yrs), sex and Tanner stage-matched were included 
into the study. Fasting blood samples for measurement of sclerostin, osteocalcin 
(OC), leptin, adiponectin, vitamin D, fasting glucose, lipid profile, HbA1c, and 
C-peptide were taken at 8.00 AM.
RESULTS: Sclerostin levels were significantly higher in patients with T1D than 
in the control group (p = 0.04) without significant differences between genders. 
Pearson correlation coefficients revealed a positive association between serum 
sclerostin levels and leptin OC (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation 
between serum sclerostin levels and leptin (r = -0.32, p = 0.02) in all of the 
subjects and no significant correlations between sclerostin and adiponectin, 
25(OH)D3, nor lipids. In the group of T1D patients a strong positive association 
between serum sclerostin levels and OC (r = 0.62, p < 0.001), and a negative 
association between serum sclerostin levels and HbA1c and leptin levels 
(r = -0.33, p = 0.04; r = -0.33, p = 0.03, respectively) were found. These 
associations were significant also after adjusting the analysis to the age, 
SDS-BMI and Tanner staging. In the healthy group after adjustment to age, 
SDS-BMI and Tanner stage, a negative correlation between sclerostin and 
C-peptide (r = -0.79, p = 0.02) was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a possible relationship between sclerostin and 
glucose metabolism in children and adolescents with T1D. It would be worth to 
investigate if an increase in sclerostin levels could present as a potential 
cause of the reduction of bone formation in T1D. Both bone-derived OC as well as 
fat-derived leptin seems to possibly modulate the participation of sclerostin in 
metabolic regulation in T1D.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is considered less common in the Asia Pacific region. 
Due to this, AIH flare as a cause of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is 
often overlooked and treatment delayed. We aimed at the defining clinical and 
histopathological spectrum and role of steroid therapy in AIH-ACLF. Patients 
with AIH-ACLF, prospectively recruited and followed between 2012 and 2017, were 
analyzed from the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver ACLF 
Research Consortium (AARC) data base. Diagnosis of AIH was confirmed using 
International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group score or simplified AIH score with 
histopathological evidence. Of 2,825 ACLF patients, 82 (2.9%) fulfilled criteria 
of AIH (age 42.1 ± 18.1 years, 70% female). At baseline, mean bilirubin was 18.6 
± 8.2 mg/dL, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 11.7 ± 1.4, and Model for End-Stage 
Liver Disease (MELD) score was 27.6 ± 6.5. Mean immunoglobulin G was 21.61 ± 
7.32 g/dL, and this was elevated ≥1.1 times in 97% of cases; 49% were 
seronegative. Liver histology was available in 90%, with median histological 
activity index of 10 (interquartile range, 7-12); 90% with moderate to severe 
interface activity; 56% showing significant parenchymal necrosis (bridging and 
confluent necrosis); and cirrhosis in 42%. Twenty-eight (34%) patients received 
steroid therapy and showed shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay (median 1.5 
versus 4 days, P < 0.001) and improved 90-day survival (75% versus 48.1%, P = 
0.02) with comparable incidence of sepsis (P = 0.32) compared to those who did 
not. Patients of advanced age, more severe liver disease (MELD >27; 83.3% 
sensitivity, 78.9% specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve 0.86), presence of hepatic encephalopathy, and fibrosis grade ≥F3 had an 
unfavorable response to corticosteroid therapy. Conclusion: AIH presenting as 
ACLF is not uncommon in Asian patients; a low threshold for liver biopsy is 
needed to confirm the diagnosis as nearly half the patients are seronegative; 
early stratification to steroid therapy or liver transplantation (MELD >27, 
hepatic encephalopathy in ≥F3) would reduce ICU stay and improve outcomes.

PURPOSE: Antibody-LGI1 limbic encephalitis (LGI1-Ab LE) is an anti-neuronal 
surface antigen-related autoimmune encephalitis. we report three cases of 
LGI1-Ab LE, describe the characteristics of clinical manifestation, course of 
evolution, imaging manifestation and treatment outcomes.
METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with LGI1-Ab LE in the Second Hospital, 
Hebei Medical University, from June 2016 to July 2017, were retrospectively 
collected and analyzed. We followed up the patients for 90 days.
RESULTS: Two of the three patients were females, the average age of onset is 53 
years old. Epilepsy is the most common clinical manifestations, and one of 
patients developed faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS), which was recently 
described as a characteristic feature of LGI1-Ab LE. All patients had cognitive 
impairment in different degrees and abnormal signal of hippocampus in cranial 
MRI. All serum LGI1 antibodies were positive, whereas one LGI1 antibodies of CSF 
were negative. All patients accepted first-line immune therapy and had a good 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: LGI1-Ab LE, which is an autoimmune disease, is rare clinically and 
mostly nonparaneoplastic. We suggest that LGI1-Ab LE be considered in any 
patient with acute or subacute onset, cognitive dysfunction , various types of 
seizures, accompanied by mental disorders and hyponatremia, MR showed the 
involvement of the limbic system. It is necessary to have LE-related antibodies 
tested. Early immunotherapy can significantly improve the patient's overall 
prognosis. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the possibility of 
potential tumors.

Several different theories of schizophrenia (SCZ) were discussed; the causes of 
this disease are not yet clear. Using ELISA, it was shown that titers of 
autoantibodies against myelin basic protein (MBP) in SCZ patients are ~1.8-fold 
higher than in healthy individuals but 5.0-fold lower than in patients with 
multiple sclerosis. Several rigid criteria were checked to show that the 
MBP-hydrolyzing activity is an intrinsic property of SCZ IgGs. Approximately 82% 
electrophoretically homogeneous SCZ IgGs purified using several affinity 
sorbents including Sepharose with immobilized MBP hydrolyze specifically only 
MBP but not many other tested proteins. The average relative activity of IgGs 
from patients with negative symptoms was 2.5-fold higher than that of patients 
with positive symptoms of SCZ, and it increases with the duration of this 
pathology. It was shown that abzymes are the earliest statistically significant 
markers of many autoimmune pathologies. Our findings surmise that the immune 
systems of individual SCZ patients can generate a variety of anti-MBP abzymes 
with different catalytic properties, which can attack MBP of the 
myelin-proteolipid shell of axons. Therefore, autoimmune processes together with 
other mechanisms can play an important role in SCZ pathogenesis. MBP-hydrolyzing 
antibodies were previously detected in the blood of 80% to 90% of patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, 
some similar neuropsychiatric indicators of disease common to SLE, MS, and SCZ 
were described in the literature. Thus, the destruction of the myelin sheath and 
the production of MBP-hydrolyzing antibodies can be a common phenomenon for some 
different diseases.

A 40-year-old male was hospitalized with renal impairment and severe 
hypercalcemia. His concentration of serum IgG4 was high, but serum whole PTH, 
1-25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and PTHrP were not elevated. Computed tomography showed 
swelling of the bilateral lacrimal glands and systemic lymphadenopathy. The 
histological findings of lacrimal gland biopsy fulfilled the diagnostic criteria 
of IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4ROD). Bone scintigraphy showed increased 
ectopic uptake in the stomach, heart, lungs, and kidneys. He died on day 16 of 
admission, although the therapies for hypercalcemia were continued. Autopsy 
results showed an increase of osteoclasts in the bone marrow and metastatic 
calcification in multiple organs, and excluded from the differential diagnosis 
other disorders which present lymph-node swelling and hypercalcemia such as 
cancer, lymphoma, Castleman's disease, and sarcoidosis. He was given a diagnosis 
of IgG4ROD with osteolytic hypercalcemia.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate discriminative ability and clinical utility of the 
Timed Up and Go under single- and dual-task conditions between fallers and 
non-fallers in multiple sclerosis (MS).
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Neurology service in a tertiary hospital.
SUBJECTS: Participants were 101 people with MS and Expanded Disability Status 
Scale score of 3-6.5. One participant withdrew after the baseline assessment, 
and hence the data were analysed for 100 participants.
INTERVENTIONS: No specific intervention.
MAIN MEASURES: Timed Up and Go and Timed Up and Go-Cognitive. Three-month 
prospective diaries recorded falls.
RESULTS: Mean age was 52.6 (SD 10.7) and 66 were female. Majority of the 
participants had progressive MS (72) and 73 used a walking aid; 56 participants 
recorded 791 falls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
values for Timed Up and Go and Timed Up and Go-Cognitive in distinguishing 
fallers (person with ⩾1 fall) from non-fallers are 0.60 and 0.57, respectively, 
and in distinguishing multiple fallers (⩾2 falls) the values are 0.46 and 0.43. 
A Timed Up and Go score of ⩾9 seconds has a sensitivity of 0.82 and a 
specificity of 0.34 to identify fallers and a sensitivity of 0.79 and a 
specificity of 0.27 to identify multiple fallers. A Timed Up and Go-Cognitive 
score of ⩾11 seconds has a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.30 to 
identify fallers and a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.26 to identify 
multiple fallers.
CONCLUSION: The Timed Up and Go and Timed Up and Go-Cognitive do not demonstrate 
sufficient clinical utility or discriminative ability for assessing falls risk 
in MS.

The international classification criteria for definite antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS) include three laboratory measurements: lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgG and 
IgM isotypes of anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β2glycoprotein I antibodies 
(anti-β2GPI). When persistently elevated, they are specific for APS; however, 
many patients that fulfil clinical criteria may exhibit negative serological 
results. These "seronegative" APS (SN-APS) are exposed to an increased 
thrombotic risk. The aims of our cross-sectional, retrospective study of 
consecutive autoimmune patients' samples were to evaluate the association of 
non-criteria antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) with thrombosis and obstetric 
events, to calculate the risk score for adverse events and to assess the 
specific contribution of single aPL positivity in SN-APS. LA, aCL, anti-β2GPI 
and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies (aPS/PT) of IgG, IgM, and IgA 
isotypes were determined in sera of 323 patients with autoimmune disorders. 
Medical records of all patients were carefully analyzed. aCL, anti-β2GPI and 
aPS/PT of IgG and IgA isotypes were significantly associated with thrombosis 
while none of the IgM aPL showed such association. aPS/PT of all isotypes, aCL 
and anti-β2GPI of IgG and IgA isotype showed significant correlation to 
obstetric events. When considering results of aPS/PT ELISA, we could 
additionally identify 3% of thrombotic patients and 2% of obstetric patients. 
Thrombotic and obstetric risk scores were calculated showing significantly 
higher association to clinical events, as compared to evaluating individual risk

Is insulin pump therapy effective in Type 1 diabetes?

Pickup JC(1).

There continues to be uncertainty about the effectiveness in Type 1 diabetes of 
insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, CSII) vs. 
multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). This narrative review discusses the 
reasons for this uncertainty, summarizes the current evidence base for CSII and 
suggests some future research needs. There are difficulties in interpreting 
trials of CSII because effectiveness varies widely due to factors such as 
differing baseline control, suboptimal use of best CSII practices, and 
psychological factors, for example, high external locus of control, 
non-adherence and lack of motivation. Many summary meta-analyses are also 
misleading because of poor trial selection (e.g. short duration, obsolete pumps, 
low baseline rate of hypoglycaemia) and reliance on mean effect size for 
decision-making. Both MDI and CSII can achieve strict glycaemic control without 
hypoglycaemia in some people with Type 1 diabetes, especially those who are 
motivated and have undergone structured diabetes education, and with high levels 
of ongoing input from healthcare professionals. CSII is particularly effective 
in those people with Type 1 diabetes who have not achieved target HbA1c levels 
without disabling hypoglycaemia using best attempts with MDI, and here there can 
be valuable and substantial improvement. Insulin pumps are safe, effective and 
accepted when used in newly diagnosed diabetes, particularly in children, where 
MDI may not be practicable. Future research needs include more studies on 
mortality associated with insulin pumps where registry data have suggested lower 
rates vs. MDI; and psychological strategies to improve non-adherence and 
suboptimal glycaemic outcomes on CSII.

Leptomeningitis is a rare central nervous system manifestation of rheumatoid 
arthritis, generally in patients with established chronic rheumatoid disease. We 
report a 41-year-old man without previous rheumatoid arthritis or psychiatric 
disorder who presented with an acute neuropsychiatric disturbance and 
polyarthralgia. His MR scan of brain showed asymmetric bifrontal 
leptomeningitis, confirmed on (18F)-fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission 
tomography. Other investigations showed highly positive serum and cerebrospinal 
fluid anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide. A leptomeningeal biopsy showed 
necrotising leptomeningeal inflammation with ill-defined granulomas and 
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate without organisms. Prolonged high-dose 
corticosteroids and then rituximab resulted in recovery. Chronic leptomeningitis 
can present with an acute neuropsychiatric disorder. We highlight that early 
rheumatoid disease can, rarely, cause a chronic leptomeningitis, reversible with 
immunotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of two 12-week exercise training 
interventions, movement-to-music (M2M) and adapted yoga (AY), on physical and 
psychosocial outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).
DESIGN: Three-arm randomized controlled proof-of-concept trial.
SETTING: A community-based fitness facility.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=81) with MS (Patient Determined Disease Steps 
[PDDS] self-reported disease status scores: 0-6) between ages of 18 and 65 years 
were randomized to M2M (n=27), AY (n=26), or waitlist control (n=28).
INTERVENTIONS: Both M2M and AY completed three 60-minute exercise sessions per 
week for 12 weeks. Waitlist controls received biweekly newsletters via mail that 
contained educational information on living with MS.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary measures were timed Up and Go (TUG, s) test, 
6-minute walk test (6MWT, m), and 5 times sit-to-stand test (FTSST, s). 
Secondary measures were self-reported outcomes assessed using Patient-Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue and Pain Interference Short Form 
8a. Participants were evaluated at baseline and postintervention. Primary 
analyses were performed using an intent-to-treat mixed model analysis of 
covariance.
RESULTS: Comparisons across all 3 groups revealed significant group differences 
in TUG and 6MWT. Post hoc analyses indicated significant improvements in TUG 
(least square mean difference [95% confidence interval] = -1.9s [-3.3 to -0.5], 
P=.01, d=0.7) and 6MWT (41.0m [2.2-80.0], P=.04, d=0.6; controlled for PDDS) in 
M2M compared to controls, while no significant differences were observed when 
compared AY to controls. No significant group differences were found in FTSST, 
fatigue, and pain interference.
CONCLUSIONS: M2M may be a useful and enjoyable exercise form for people with MS 
in improving mobility and walking endurance and merits long-term study in larger 
study populations.

Testing for antiphospholipid antibodies could be an important part in 
determining the cause of a cerebrovascular event (CVE). Currently, it is also 
unknown whether antiphospholipid antibodies represent a risk factor for the 
development of a CVE and whether the selected therapy options are efficacious. 
So, this study aimed at (1) determining the frequency of patients experiencing a 
CVE and fulfilling the laboratory criterion for an antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS), (2) investigating whether the persistent presence of antiphospholipid 
antibodies represented a risk factor for a CVE, and (3) focusing on the efficacy 
of the selected treatment strategy in the first year after the CVE. Eighty-nine 
patients with an acute CVE were prospectively followed for 1 year. At least two 
sera from each were tested for lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin, 
anti-β2-glycoprotein I, anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin and anti-annexin V 
antibodies. Twenty out of eighty-nine (22%) of CVE patients fulfilled the 
criteria for APS (17/20 for definitive and 3 for probable APS). There was a 
significant association between persistently present antiphospholipid antibodies 
and the CVE (OR, 4.62). No statistically significant difference was found in the 
CVE recurrence rate between APS-CVE and non-APS-CVE patients being treated 
mainly with acetyl salicylic acid. Antiphospholipid antibodies represent an 
independent risk factor for a CVE. In the first year after the CVE, antiplatelet 
therapy seemed to be sufficient in secondary CVE thromboprophylaxis in most APS 
patients.

Glucocorticoid monotherapy has been the mainstay treatment of giant cell 
arteritis (GCA) for decades. We aimed to evaluate the role of leflunomide as a 
steroid-sparing agent in GCA. This open-label study included incipient GCA 
patients followed for at least 48 weeks at a single secondary/tertiary 
rheumatology centre. At the time of diagnosis, patients received 
glucocorticoids. At week 12 of follow-up, leflunomide 10 mg qd was recommended 
as an adjunctive therapy to all patients without contraindications. The decision 
to start the leflunomide was patient-dependent. The number of relapses, a 
cumulative glucocorticoid dose during follow-up and treatment-related adverse 
events (AE) were recorded and compared between glucocorticoid-only and 
leflunomide groups. Seventy-six patients (65.8% female, median (IQR) age 73.7 
(66.1-78.8) years) were followed for a median (IQR) 96 (86-96) weeks. Thirty out 
of 76 (39.5%) patients received leflunomide at week 12 (leflunomide group); the 
others continued treatment with glucocorticoid (glucocorticoid-only group). 
During the first 48 weeks of follow-up, 22 patients relapsed, 4 (13.3%) in 
leflunomide group and 18 (39.1%) in glucocorticoid-only group. The difference 
was statistically significant (p = 0.02; NNT 3.9 (95% CI 2.2-17.4)). 
Furthermore, 17/30 (56.7%) patients in the leflunomide group managed to stop 
glucocorticoid at week 48 (with one relapse (5.9%) shortly afterwards). The 
cumulative glucocorticoid dose at the last visit was lower in the leflunomide 
group than in the glucocorticoid-only group (p = 0.01). Our findings indicate 
the steroid-sparing effect of leflunomide in GCA.

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role of the fractalkine (FKN)/CX3 CR1 pathway in 
joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: We examined the effect of treatment with anti-mouse FKN (anti-mFKN) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) on joint destruction and the migration of osteoclast 
precursors (OCPs) into the joint, using the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
model. DBA/1 mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen to induce 
arthritis, and then treated with anti-mFKN mAb. Disease severity was monitored 
by arthritis score, and joint destruction was evaluated by soft x-ray and 
histologic analyses. Plasma levels of joint destruction markers were assessed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FKN expression on endothelial cells was 
detected by immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow-derived OCPs were labeled with 
fluorescein and transferred to mice with CIA, and the migration of the OCPs to 
the joints was then analyzed.
RESULTS: Both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with anti-mFKN mAb 
significantly decreased the arthritis and soft x-ray scores. Plasma levels of 
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and matrix metalloproteinase 3 decreased 
after treatment with anti-mFKN mAb. Histologic analysis revealed that anti-mFKN 
mAb inhibited synovitis, pannus formation, and cartilage destruction, as well as 
suppressed bone damage, with a marked reduction in the number of 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts. Anti-mFKN mAb strongly 
inhibited the migration of bone marrow-derived OCPs into the affected synovium.
CONCLUSION: Anti-mFKN mAb notably ameliorates arthritis and joint destruction in 
the CIA model, as well as inhibits migration of OCPs into the synovium. These 
results suggest that inhibition of the FKN/CX3 CR1 pathway could be a novel 
strategy for treatment of both synovitis and joint destruction in rheumatoid 
arthritis.

PURPOSE: To compare anatomic and functional outcomes in eyes with proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy (PDR) that were lost to follow-up (LTFU) for more than 6 
months after treatment with either intravitreal injection (IVI) of anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents or panretinal photocoagulation (PRP).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine patients who were LTFU immediately after treatment for 
more than 6 months between September 2013 and September 2016.
METHODS: Patients with eyes receiving either intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment or 
PRP with the next follow-up visit occurring more than 6 months after treatment 
were identified. Visual acuity (VA) and anatomic outcomes at the visit before 
being LTFU, the return visit, the 6-month visit after return, the 12-month visit 
after return, and the final visit were gathered and compared between the 2 
treatment groups.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Visual acuity and anatomic outcomes.
RESULTS: Seventy-six eyes of 59 patients were included in the study, of which 30 
received IVI with anti-VEGF and 46 received PRP. In the anti-VEGF group, mean VA 
worsened significantly when comparing the visit before being LTFU (0.43±0.38 
logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) with the return visit 
(0.97±0.80 logMAR; P = 0.001) as well as with the final visit (0.92±0.94 logMAR; 
P = 0.01). In the PRP group, mean VA worsened significantly when comparing the 
visit before being LTFU (0.42±0.34 logMAR) with the return visit (0.62±0.64 
logMAR; P = 0.03). However, no significant difference was observed at the final 
visit (0.46±0.47 logMAR; P = 0.38). There was a significantly greater number of 
eyes with tractional retinal detachment in the IVI group compared with the PRP 
group at the final visit (10 vs. 1, respectively; P = 0.005). There was a 
significantly greater incidence of neovascularization of the iris in the IVI arm 
compared with the PRP arm at the final visit (4 vs. 0, respectively; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with PDR that received only intravitreal anti-VEGF 
demonstrated worse anatomic and functional outcomes after being LTFU compared 
with eyes that received PRP. Given the potential sequelae of being LTFU, the 
choice of treatment for PDR must be considered carefully.

OBJECTIVE: There is scarce information regarding the performance of a specific, 
structured education program addressed to patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) including both routine use 
of the therapy and patient experience evaluation. We aimed to assess the routine 
use of CSII and patient's experience and satisfaction regarding a specific 
structured patient self-management education and care program.
METHODS: A retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study collecting CSII 
routine use downloaded data. Patient experience and satisfaction were evaluated 
using an anonymous online survey covering different aspects of CSII 
self-management education and care program.
RESULTS: 380 T1D subjects were included (aged 45.3±12.17 years, 62.1% women, 
diabetes duration 27.8±10.3 years, 9.7±4.7 years on CSII, HbA1c 7.7+1.0%; 
61.0±7.9mmol/mol). Participants with HbA1c≤7.5% (58mmol/mol, n=178) did more 
SMBGs per day (4.4±2.1 vs. 3.9±1.9); used more boluses (5.0±1.8 vs. 4.5±2.0); 
the percentage of insulin given as bolus was higher (50.1±12.8 vs. 44.9±13.2%); 
the night bolus wizard (BW) high glucose target was lower (125.9±4.4 vs. 
130.5±12.8mg/dl) and time on CSII therapy was shorter (8.9±4.6 vs. 10.3±4.6 
years. p<0.05 all comparisons). More SMBG/day, shorter duration of CSII 
treatment, a lower BW low glucose target at night, a lower BW high glucose 
target at night, total insulin dose per day and total number of carbohydrates 
per day were related with better HbA1c levels. 60% of 373 patients answered the 
questionnaire. The response to the different aspects of the educational program 
was homogeneously highly satisfactory. Seventy-seven percent of patients scored 
the program as very useful. Ninety-three percent of CSII users would not return 
to their previous insulin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of routine clinical use of CSII by T1D patients 
demonstrates that glucose control may be associated with some pump usage and 
adherence parameters. The overall user experience and satisfaction with our CSII 
self-management education and care program was remarkably favorable.

OBJECTIVE: African American patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are 
at high risk for poor outcomes. Both patient characteristics and the severity of 
the disease may influence physician-patient interactions, which in turn can 
impact disease outcomes. We aimed to examine whether patient perceptions of 
interpersonal processes of care (i.e. physician-patient interactions) varied by 
demographic characteristics, disease activity, and/or depression in African 
American patients with SLE.
METHODS: The Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) is a cohort drawn from a 
population-based registry of people with SLE. We conducted a cross-sectional 
analysis of patient-reported data collected in 2016-17 among 698 African 
American participants (out of 863 GOAL participants). We assessed 
physician-patient interactions (communication, patient-centered decision making, 
and physician interpersonal style) through the Interpersonal Processes of Care 
survey (IPC-29), disease activity through the Systemic Lupus Activity 
Questionnaire, and depression through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Mean 
scores of the IPC-29 scales were compared by gender, age and educational 
attainment with Wilcoxon rank-sum 2-sample test or Kruskal Wallis test. We 
conducted linear trend test to examine demographic-adjusted scores of IPC across 
severity of disease activity and depression, and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses to examine the association of disease activity and 
depression with suboptimal IPC scores.
RESULTS: Overall, the lowest mean scores were observed for the patient-centered 
decision making domain, and specifically about how often doctors assessed 
patients' problems to follow recommendations and treatment among females 
compared with males (mean scores 3.13 ± 1.42 and 3.64 ± 1.38, respectively; 
p = 0.015). Mean scores for the assumed socioeconomic level subdomain (how often 
doctors make assumptions about a patient's socioeconomic level) were worse in 
individuals aged 18-34 (mean score 1.59 ± 0.94), compared to those aged 35-55 
(mean score 1.47 ± 0.94; p = 0.033). Patients with some college or higher 
educational attainment reported poorer mean scores for most communication and 
interpersonal style scales than those who reported high-school or less. We found 
significant linear trends of poorer scores for all communication scales across 
more severe disease activity and depression symptoms, and poorer scores for all 
interpersonal style scales across more severe disease activity. Multivariate 
models revealed that while depression was associated with suboptimal quality of 
both communication (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.04-1.39) and interpersonal style (OR 1.12; 
95% CI 1.01-1.25), disease activity only increased the odds of suboptimal 
interpersonal style (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.03-1.25).
CONCLUSION: In the African American population with SLE, suboptimal interactions 
with providers may be explained in part by the mental and physical symptoms of 
the patient, regardless of age, gender and education. In addition to standard of 
care treatment, SLE patients with more severe disease activity and depression 
might need provider-based interventions focused on communication and 
interpersonal style.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the size of unmet needs in the treatment of early 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (eRA), using all the conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and/or biological DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) in a long-term observational study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 538 patients with eRA were evaluated. The 2010 ACR/EULAR 
classification criteria were used. All patients were csDMARDs and bDMARDs-naive 
with disease duration less than one year. They were treated according to EULAR 
and ACR recommendations for RA. All the csDMARDs and bDMARDs were used. 
Clinical, laboratory findings with the disease activity score-28 and treatment 
decisions were all recorded as well as adverse drug reactions, reason of therapy 
termination, disease complications and comorbidities.
RESULTS: Methotrexate (58%) and Infliximab (37%) where the first csDMARD and 
bDMARD choice respectively. During follow-up, 14 patients were lost and 7 
developed comorbidities. The final results are referred to 517 patients. Among 
those, 66% were treated with csDMARDs as monotherapy or in combination therapy 
with sustained low disease activity (LDA). However, 3.2% from this group neither 
achieved LDA, nor received bDMARDs, due to comorbidities. On the other hand, 34% 
were treated with bDMARDs with or without csDMARDs. The majority of them 
demonstrated sustained LDA. From this group, 17.7% never achieved LDA, despite 
that they switched and received all bDMARDs. Thus, 20.9% of our patients never 
achieved LDA.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the current recommendations for RA therapy we successfully 
treated the majority of our patients. However, we found that the size of gap and 
the unmet needs for treatment is about 20%.

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) secondary to anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare life-threatening 
condition presenting with severe respiratory failure. The management of 
AAV-related DAH consists of remission induction immunosuppressive therapy, which 
requires time to be effective, with significant fatality rates despite 
appropriate treatment. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support 
gas exchanges providing the time necessary for immunosuppressive treatment to 
control the underlying disease in cases refractory to the conventional 
ventilation techniques. Despite severe preexisting bleeding has been considered 
a relative contraindication, ECMO has proven to be life-saving in several cases 
of respiratory failure associated with pulmonary haemorrhage due to various 
causes, including AAV. We reviewed the clinical presentation and course of two 
patients affected by AAV-related DAH treated at our Institution between 2012 and 
2017, whose management required the use of veno-venous ECMO. We reviewed the 
current literature on the role of ECMO in the support of these patients. In both 
patients, ECMO provided life support and allowed disease control, in combination 
with immunosuppressive treatment. Despite systemic anticoagulation, clinical 
improvement was achieved without exacerbation of the pulmonary bleeding. We 
performed a literature review, and summarized available data confirming the 
effectiveness and safety of ECMO in AAV-related DAH. ECMO has a life-saving role 
in the management of patients with severe respiratory failure due to 
ANCA-associated pulmonary capillaritis.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) develops from various etiologies, and it is 
often difficult to distinguish the etiology of TMA in kidney transplantation. 
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is one of the differential diagnoses for TMA 
that may cause acute loss of graft function or fatal thrombotic complications. 
This report details a 66-year-old male patient with polycythemia after 
ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. Antibody screening tests were negative 
before transplant. Despite administration of an adequate desensitization therapy 
including plasmapheresis and rituximab, he developed acute graft dysfunction on 
postoperative day 112 and graft biopsy revealed prominent microvascular 
inflammation in the glomerular capillaries without immunoglobulin deposits. Flow 
cytometric panel-reactive antibody screening failed to detect donor-specific 
antibodies at both pre-transplant and episode biopsies. Anticardiolipin antibody 
was repeatedly positive, but neither thrombosis nor previous thrombotic episodes 
were detected. After excluding several differential diagnoses, the graft 
dysfunction with unexplained TMA was treated with steroid pulse, plasmapheresis 
and rituximab re-induction. Anticardiolipin antibody disappeared after this 
intensive treatment and graft function recovered gradually and stabilized for 
52 months. This report suggests that asymptomatic anticardiolipin antibody may 
be associated with acute graft dysfunction. Even if thrombotic episodes are not 
observed, an exist of anticardiolipin antibody may be one of the risk factors of 
renal TMA after kidney transplantation.

Epidemiological data for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) differ according to ethnicity 
and geographical region. Moreover, despite of clear RA management guidelines, 
the implementation of treat-to-target (T2T) strategy often remains incomplete. 
Our objectives were to determine the incidence rate of RA, the clinical 
characteristics, and the level of adherence to the T2T guidelines in Slovenia. 
We analyzed prospectively the collected data of adult patients diagnosed with RA 
from 2014 through 2016 at the Department of Rheumatology, University Medical 
Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. The department provides rheumatology 
services to a well-defined region with a population of 704,000 adult residents. 
During the 3-year observation, we identified 341 incipient cases of RA (75% 
females, median (IQR) aged 64 (52.0-75.4) years), resulting in an annual 
incidence rate of 16.1 per 100,000 adults (95% CI 14.5-17.9). The incidence rate 
peaked in the 70-79-year age interval. The median time from the onset of 
symptoms suggestive of RA to rheumatology consultation was 12.9 (4.4-26.1) 
weeks, and the median time from referral to consultation was 1 (1-3) day. Within 
12 weeks of symptom onset, 161 (47.2%) incipient RA patients were examined by a 
rheumatologist, and 123 (36.1%) were started on DMARD therapy. The estimated 
incidence rate was in line with the available epidemiological data. Our early 
interventional clinic enabled us to identify and manage a substantial portion of 
RA patients within the recommended time frame.

OBJECTIVES: Evidence of the economic burden and long-term outcomes of juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) remains scarce. Our aim was to explore healthcare 
costs and long-term outcomes in adult patients with JIA.
METHOD: We identified all adult patients (≥ 18 years) with JIA who visited 
Jyväskylä Central Hospital rheumatology unit between May 2007 and March 2016. We 
considered individual medians of time-dependent clinical variables. These data 
were linked to administrative data from the area from the fiscal year 2014, 
which include information on all public healthcare contacts. Healthcare 
utilization is presented as direct costs in euros (EUR). Factors affecting 
direct costs were assessed with a generalized linear model.
RESULTS: In 218 patients, median 28-joint Disease Activity Score with three 
variables (DAS28-3) was < 2.6 in 88.6% in those aged < 30 and in 72.9% in those 
aged ≥ 30 years, and median Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score was 
< 0.5 in 85.7% and 45.4%, respectively. In the utilization data (four 
municipalities, 137 patients), the total annual health services-related direct 
costs were 432 257 EUR (mean = 3155 EUR/patient/year). Thirty-six patients 
(26.3%) used biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in 2014 
for a total of 355 months, and the annual cost of bDMARDs was estimated at 
355 000 EUR. Those with active disease had mean costs 2.4-fold higher than those 
with low or no disease activity. A one-point increase in median raw HAQ incurred 
an average 228 EUR increase in annual costs (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Most adult patients with JIA seem to manage well with their 
arthritis, bearing in mind that there still is room for improvement in long-term 
outcomes.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis in individuals older than 
50 years, characterized by headaches, visual disturbances, painful scalp, jaw 
claudication, impairment of limb arteries, and systemic inflammation, among 
other symptoms. GCA diagnosis is confirmed by a positive temporal artery biopsy 
(TAB) or by imaging modalities. A prominent acute phase response with 
inflammation is the hallmark of the disease, predominantly targeting large- and 
medium-sized arteries leading to stenosis or occlusion of arterial lumen. To 
date, there are no reliable tissue markers specific for GCA. Scarce reports have 
indicated the importance of epigenetics in GCA. The current systematic review 
reports significantly changed candidate biomarkers in TABs of GCA patients 
compared to non-GCA patients using qPCR.

BACKGROUND: The clinicopathological significance of immunofluorescent findings 
in IgA nephropathy remains controversial.
METHODS: The relations of the deposition of IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q and 
fibrinogen (Fib) with pathological findings, baseline clinical findings, and 
renal outcome were evaluated in 688 patients with IgA nephropathy. Pathological 
features included cellular or fibrocellular crescents, endocapillary or 
mesangial hypercellularity, segmental or global glomerulosclerosis and the 
Oxford classification.
RESULTS: The median age at biopsy was 30 years. There were 289 men. With 
74 months median follow-up, 32% of patients received steroids. Twelve percent of 
patients developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The degree of IgA was closely 
related to the degree of C3, IgG and IgM deposition. The degree of IgA, C3, IgG 
and Fib deposition was significantly related to the percentage of glomeruli with 
crescent, endocapillary and mesangial hypercellularity. IgM deposition showed 
significant association with crescent, mesangial hypercellularity, segmental 
sclerosis, global glomerulosclerosis and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis. 
In the patients treated with steroids, the risk for ESRD in patients with 
2-3+ IgA deposition was significantly lower with reference of 1+ IgA deposition.
CONCLUSION: We found the different roles of glomerular immune reactants' 
deposition in the inflammatory process from acute to chronic stage. IgA 
deposition together with IgG, Fib and C3 may produce acute inflammatory injury. 
IgM deposition might occur in the early stage of inflammation and remains until 
late sclerotic stage. The prominent deposition of IgA related to low risk for 
ESRD in patients who received steroids might suggest effectiveness of steroids 
in such patients.

BACKGROUND: We compared pre-emptive transplant rates between SLE and non-SLE 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) and 
investigated the potential influence of frequency matching and primary ESRD 
causes in the non-SLE group.
METHODS: 4830 adult SLE patients with incident ESRD from USRDS 2005-2009 were 
frequency matched by age, sex and race to 4830 patients with incident non-SLE 
ESRD. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of 
pre-emptive transplantation in SLE and non-SLE, and with the non-SLE subgroups 
by primary ESRD cause.
RESULTS: The odds ratios (OR) of receiving a pre-emptive transplant were similar 
among non-SLE and SLE (referent group): OR = 1.18 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.50; 
p = 0.20). However, the ORs for receiving a pre-emptive transplant were 0.19 
(95% CI: 0.08, 0.42) in type 2 diabetes ESRD, 0.42 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.75) for 
hypertension-associated ESRD, 1.67 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.54) in type 1 diabetes ESRD, 
and 2.06 (95% CI: 1.55, 2.73) for "other" ESRD. In contrast to non-SLE, younger 
SLE patients were less likely to receive a pre-emptive transplant than older SLE 
patients.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide compelling evidence that major 
improvements need to be made in optimizing access to pre-emptive transplantation 
in SLE by addressing sociodemographic disparities and the unique challenges 
faced by SLE patients. Applying careful matching and selecting appropriate 
comparison groups in future studies may facilitate the development of effective 
strategies to address these barriers and to increase the number of pre-emptive 
renal transplants among SLE patients.

Simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPKT) is an effective 
treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes and end stage renal disease. 
Increasing demands for organs for transplantation coupled with a rise in age and 
size of adult donors has led to greater utilization of pediatric donors, and 
with good outcomes. Nonetheless, there remains reticence among transplant 
surgeons to transplant pancreases from small pediatric donors despite the 
optimal characteristics and macroscopic features of the younger pancreas. We 
report a successful case of SPKT from a small pediatric donor and explore the 
aspects of potential concern that might have led some clinicians to decline 
these organs. We also discuss the measures taken to overcome potential obstacles 
to successful transplantation from this donor source, and the rationale behind 
them.

A 73-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis 
(AIP) without kidney lesions. She was treated with prednisolone (PSL) 30 mg/day, 
and her AIP symptoms promptly improved, after which the PSL dose was gradually 
tapered to 5 mg/day. Her renal function had remained normal (serum creatinine 
0.7 mg/dL) until 1 year before the current admission without any imaging 
abnormalities in the kidney. However, during this past year her renal function 
gradually declined (serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL). Follow-up computed tomography 
incidentally revealed unilateral renal atrophy, which rapidly progressed during 
the subsequent 10-month period without left kidney atrophy. A diagnosis of 
IgG4-RKD probably due to TIN was made, and we increased the dose of prednisolone 
to 30 mg/day. 1 month after administration, multiple low-density lesions on both 
kidneys were improved slightly but almost all lesions persisted as atrophic 
scars. Our case suggested that unilateral renal atrophy can develop in patients 
with IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis without hydronephrosis caused by 
retroperitoneal fibrosis, and that monitoring the serum creatinine levels is not 
always sufficient, thereby highlighting the importance of regular imaging 
monitoring to detect newly developing kidney lesions.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common vasculitis in adults aged 
≥ 50 years in Europe. Recently, colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDS) and 
positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) have improved the 
diagnostic sensitivity. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of 
GCA in a well-defined Slovenian region, supported by the temporal artery (TA) 
biopsy (TAB) or CDS or PET/CT. This prospective study was conducted at the 
University Medical Centre Ljubljana, the only secondary/tertiary centre in the 
region, serving a population of 323,297 residents aged ≥ 50 years. Patients with 
suspected GCA are referred either to the Department of Rheumatology, or in case 
of severe visual disturbances, to the Department of Ophthalmology. We included 
all GCA cases diagnosed between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2017. We 
diagnosed cranial GCA (c-GCA) using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
1990 classification criteria and a positive TAB or TA-CDS. Large vessel GCA 
(lv-GCA) was diagnosed using CDS or PET/CT. During the 6-year observation, we 
identified 169 incipient GCA cases (66.3% female, median (IQR) age of 75.1 
(68.6-80.0) years). Forty-two (24.8%) patients had lv-GCA, and the others had 
c-GCA. The estimated annual incidence rates of GCA were overall 8.7 (95% CI 
7.5-10.1), c-GCA 6.5 (95% CI 5.5-7.8) and lv-GCA 2.2 (95%CI 1.6-2.9) per 100,000 
aged ≥ 50 years. GCA is the most common vasculitis in adults aged ≥ 50 years, 
with an annual incidence rate of 8.7 per 100,000.

OBJECTIVE: There are variable reports of risk of concordance for progression to 
islet autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes in identical twins after one twin is 
diagnosed. We examined development of positive autoantibodies and type 1 
diabetes and the effects of genetic factors and common environment on 
autoantibody positivity in identical twins, nonidentical twins, and full 
siblings.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention 
Study (N = 48,026) were screened from 2004 to 2015 for islet autoantibodies (GAD 
antibody [GADA], insulinoma-associated antigen 2 [IA-2A], and autoantibodies 
against insulin [IAA]). Of these subjects, 17,226 (157 identical twins, 283 
nonidentical twins, and 16,786 full siblings) were followed for autoantibody 
positivity or type 1 diabetes for a median of 2.1 years.
RESULTS: At screening, identical twins were more likely to have positive GADA, 
IA-2A, and IAA than nonidentical twins or full siblings (all P < 0.0001). 
Younger age, male sex, and genetic factors were significant factors for 
expression of IA-2A, IAA, one or more positive autoantibodies, and two or more 
positive autoantibodies (all P ≤ 0.03). Initially autoantibody-positive 
identical twins had a 69% risk of diabetes by 3 years compared with 1.5% for 
initially autoantibody-negative identical twins. In nonidentical twins, type 1 
diabetes risk by 3 years was 72% for initially multiple autoantibody-positive, 
13% for single autoantibody-positive, and 0% for initially autoantibody-negative 
nonidentical twins. Full siblings had a 3-year type 1 diabetes risk of 47% for 
multiple autoantibody-positive, 12% for single autoantibody-positive, and 0.5% 
for initially autoantibody-negative subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of type 1 diabetes at 3 years is high for initially multiple 
and single autoantibody-positive identical twins and multiple 
autoantibody-positive nonidentical twins. Genetic predisposition, age, and male 
sex are significant risk factors for development of positive autoantibodies in 
twins.

PURPOSE: To assess differential patterns of axonal loss and demyelination in the 
optic nerve in multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorders (NMOSD).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ninety-two participants, including 136 MS patients 
(272 eyes), 19 NMOSD patients (38 eyes), and 37 healthy control participants (74 
eyes).
METHODS: All participants underwent spectral-domain OCT scans and multifocal 
visual evoked potential (mfVEP) recordings. High-resolution magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) with the diffusion protocol also was performed in all patients.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness and 
mfVEP amplitude and latency at 5 eccentricities; global and temporal retinal 
nerve fiber layer thickness.
RESULTS: In optic neuritis (ON) eyes, the NMOSD patients had more severe GCIPL 
loss (P < 0.001) and mfVEP amplitude reduction (P < 0.001) compared with MS 
patients, whereas in contrast, mfVEP latency delay was more evident in MS 
patients (P < 0.001). The NMOSD patients showed more morphologic and functional 
loss at the foveal to parafoveal region, whereas the MS patients showed evenly 
distributed damage at the macula. Correlation analysis demonstrated a strong 
structure-function (OCT-mfVEP) association in the NMOSD patients, which was only 
moderate in the MS patients. In non-ON (NON) eyes, the MS patients showed 
significantly thinner GCIPL than controls (P < 0.001), whereas no GCIPL loss was 
observed in NON eyes in NMOSD. In addition, a significant correlation was found 
between all OCT and mfVEP measures in MS patients, but not in NMOSD patients. 
MRI demonstrated significant lesional load in the optic radiation in MS compared 
to NMOSD eyes (P = 0.002), which was related to the above OCT and mfVEP changes 
in NON eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated different patterns of ON damage in NMOSD and 
MS. In MS, the ON damage was less severe, with demyelination as the main 
pathologic component, whereas in NMOSD, axonal loss was more severe compared 
with myelin loss. The disproportional mfVEP amplitude and latency changes 
suggested predominant axonal damage within the anterior visual pathway as the 
main clinical feature of NMOSD, in contrast to MS, where demyelination spreads 
along the entire visual pathway.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prophylactic effect of sulfasalazine against 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
METHODS: We used a nationwide Japanese multicenter RA database to extract data 
from 2005 and 2014. To identify PJP cases, we selected patients hospitalized for 
PJP and verified their diagnosis. Two control groups, one unmatched and the 
other matched for age, sex, glucocorticoid, methotrexate, and tacrolimus dosage, 
and the use (and type, if used) of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drug were selected by incidence-density sampling. The odds ratios for PJP 
associated with sulfasalazine use and other clinical factors were estimated by 
exact and standard conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: From 18,668 participants, 60 cases, 356 unmatched controls, and 337 
matched controls were selected. None of the cases received sulfasalazine before 
PJP onset. A comparison of the cases with the unmatched controls showed that 
sulfasalazine use carried a decreased risk of PJP (adjusted odds ratio 0.18, 95% 
confidence interval 0.00-0.92). A comparison of the cases and matched controls 
also showed that sulfasalazine use had a decreased risk of PJP (0.08, 
0.00-0.36). In an analysis of the cases and unmatched controls who did not 
receive sulfasalazine, an increased risk of PJP was associated with lung disease 
(3.88, 1.89-7.95) and the use of glucocorticoid (5.71, 2.68-12.19), methotrexate 
(5.25, 2.01-13.74), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (2.32, 1.10-4.93).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this nested case-control study demonstrated the 
preventive effect of sulfasalazine against PJP. The results await confirmation 
by future prospective studies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of salivary gland ultrasonography for the 
diagnosis of primary and secondary Sjögren's syndromes (pSS and sSS).
METHOD: Multicenter cross-sectional study on 97 patients with clinical sicca 
symptoms. The pSS (n = 22) met the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) 
classification criteria. The control patients (n = 36) with sicca symptoms did 
not fulfill the AECG criteria. Four scores were used to evaluate the 4 major 
salivary gland echostructure: the Salaffi score (0-16), Jousse-Joulin score 
(0-4), Hocevar score (0-48) and Milic score (0-12).
RESULTS: The medians of ultrasonographic (US) scores were higher in the pSS and 
sSS groups than in the control group (P < 0.001). The receiver-operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves and the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of the four 
scores showed a good diagnostic performance for the US diagnosis of pSS and sSS. 
Respectively, for pSS and sSS, the AUC were 0.891 (95%CI 0.812-0.970) and 0.824 
(95%CI 0.695-0.954) for Hocevar score, 0.885 (95%CI 0.804-0.965) and 0.808 
(95%CI 0.673-0.943) for Milic score, 0.915 (95%CI 0.848-0.982) and 0.844 (95%CI 
0.724-0.965) for Salaffi score, 0.897 (95%CI 0.821-0.973) and 0.851 (95%CI 
0.735-0.968) for Jousse-Joulin score. This study showed an interesting 
inter-observer reproducibility (kappa = 0.714 ± 0.131) of the US evaluation with 
85.7% agreement between reader to determine the pathological character of the 
salivary glands.
CONCLUSION: Salivary gland US is a simple, non-invasive and performant imaging 
procedure for the diagnosis of pSS and sSS, with Salaffi, Milic and 
Jousse-Joulin scores.

AIMS: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a seasonal influenza vaccine 
in a cohort of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving different 
immunomodulating/immunosuppressive therapies and assess predictors of immune 
response.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, non-randomized observational study 
including 108 patients receiving a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination was 
conducted. Influenza-specific antibody titers (H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B) were 
measured to evaluate rates of seroprotection and seroconversion/significant 
titer increase. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to 
identify prognostic factors of vaccination outcomes.
RESULTS: Regarding the whole cohort, seroprotection rates >70% were achieved for 
each influenza strain. Interferon-treated patients reached high seroprotection 
rates (>84%). Good seroprotection rates were seen in patients treated with 
glatiramer acetate. In particular for H3N2, response rates were low in 
natalizumab-treated patients and in the small subgroup of fingolimod-treated 
patients. Patients with a previous disease-modifying therapy and a longer 
disease duration were less likely to respond sufficiently. No severe adverse 
events were reported. MS disease activity was not increased after a one-year 
follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Vaccination led to good immunogenicity, especially in MS patients 
treated with interferons and glatiramer acetate. At least for the H1N1 strain, 
rates of seroprotection and seroconversion/significant titer increase were high 
(>70% and >60%, respectively) for all therapeutic subgroups. Patients with a 
longer duration of the disease are exposed to an increased risk of insufficient 
immune response to vaccination.

BACKGROUND: Good glycaemic control during pregnancy is key to reduce maternal 
and foetal complications. Insulin degludec, an ultralong acting analogue with a 
"peakless" and stable pharmacokinetic profile, has the potential advantage of 
reducing hypoglycaemia and glucose variability compared to other basal insulins. 
Therefore, degludec could be a reasonable therapeutic option for pregnant women 
with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, degludec is not licensed for use during 
pregnancy owing to the lack of safety data.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We herein report details on pregnancy and foetal outcomes 
in three women with uncontrolled T1D treated with insulin degludec during the 
first trimester or the whole pregnancy. In addition, we report an updated review 
of similar cases reported in literature. Overall, no congenital neonatal 
malformation was observed in the six cases described. Three babies required 
neonatal intensive care unit admission for respiratory distress, apnoeas, 
bilirubin increase or hypoglycaemia. However, the observed neonatal 
complications were deemed unlikely to be related to degludec treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, while awaiting for the results of an ongoing randomized 
controlled trial, data on six cases of degludec exposure during pregnancy 
reassuringly suggest no embryo-foetal toxicity. More information is needed 
before degludec can be safely recommended during pregnancy.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are thought to play an important role in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but are also found in healthy donors (HDs). Previous 
studies examined variable region sequences of these autoantibodies at a time 
when knowledge of the human germline repertoire was incomplete. Here we 
collected and analyzed RF sequence data from the literature to elucidate how RFs 
develop and whether their characteristics differ between RA patients and HDs.
METHODS: A database was built containing nucleotide sequences of RF heavy and 
light chain variable domains and characteristics including affinity, isotype and 
specificity, all collected from published papers. Gene usage and mutation 
frequencies were analyzed using IMGT/HiV-QUEST. Selection strength was assessed 
with the BASELINe tool.
RESULTS: Sequences were retrieved for 183 RF clones (87 RA; 67 HDs; 29 other). 
No biased gene usage was observed for RA and HDs. However, there does appear to 
be skewed gene usage in RFs from patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia. Mutation 
frequency varies considerably between RFs, and isotype-switched clones have 
significantly more mutations. Monospecific RFs carry more mutations than 
polyspecific RFs; no difference was found for RA- versus HD-derived RFs. 
Overall, reported affinity is low (median 1 µM), with a non-significant trend 
toward higher affinity of RA-derived RFs. Mutation frequency and affinity did 
not appear to be correlated. BASELINe analysis suggests an overall lack of 
positive selection and less negative selection strength in RA-derived RFs.
CONCLUSIONS: RFs derived from RA patients have similar properties as those 
derived from HDs. The RF response can be characterized as a moderately matured 
autoantibody response, with variable levels of somatic hypermutation, but low 
affinity.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 
rheumatoid factor (RF) isotype for the detection of primary Sjogren's syndrome 
(pSS) and evaluate the clinical and serological associations of immunoglobulin 
(Ig) A RF in patients with pSS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RF levels were measured in 77 and 37 patients with pSS 
and idiopathic sicca symptoms, respectively, using ELISA and analysed with 
respect to clinical and laboratory disease characteristics. Receiver operating 
characteristic curves were used to determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy 
of IgA RF with other diagnostic tests.
RESULTS: Serum levels of IgA RF were significantly higher in patients with pSS 
than in those with idiopathic sicca symptoms. IgA RF showed sensitivity, 
specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of 83.1, 78.4, 88.9, and 
69.0%, respectively, for pSS diagnosis. IgA RF was associated with xerostomia, 
severe sialoscintigraphic grade, low unstimulated salivary flow rate (USFR), 
antinuclear antibody, high IgG and IgM/G RF levels, and low C3 levels in 
patients with pSS. IgA RF titres had positive correlations with 
sialoscintigraphic grade and IgG and IgG/M RF levels and had negative 
correlations with USFR and C3 levels.
CONCLUSION: Our findings confirmed the potential of IgA RF to distinguish pSS 
from idiopathic sicca symptoms. The presence of IgA RF in patients with pSS was 
associated with significantly worse exocrine function and active serologic 
profile. No association between IgA RF and extra-glandular manifestations was 
noted.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: IgA RF should be the predictive and diagnostic marker in 
patients with pSS.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate salivary adiponectin and adenosine deaminase (ADA) in 
women suffering from Sjögren's syndrome (SS).
METHODS: Salivary adiponectin and ADA were measured in patients with SS (n = 17) 
and compared to their values in healthy controls (n = 13) and patients suffering 
from drug-induced xerostomia (non-SS sicca group; n = 19). A clinical history 
was made for each patient, patients were examined clinically, and xerostomia 
inventory (XI) was performed.
RESULTS: Salivary adiponectin corrected by total protein was higher in patients 
with SS than in healthy individuals (P < 0.05) or patients with non-SS sicca 
(P < 0.01) and correlated with XI (r = 0.555; P < 0.05). Salivary ADA was higher 
in patients with SS and non-SS sicca compared to controls (P < 0.05 in both 
cases).
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that adiponectin and ADA 
are increased in the saliva of patients with SS.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Salivary adiponectin corrected by total protein can be a 
potential biomarker of SS.

BACKGROUND: In adults, the absence of a preexisting chronic liver disease (CLD) 
is required to diagnose acute liver failure (ALF). The pediatric classification 
does not consider this aspect, thus previous studies pooled together children 
with ALF and children with unknown CLD presenting with acute hepatic 
decompensation (ALF-CLD). We aimed to compare prevalence, features, and outcome 
of children with ALF-CLD to those with a proper ALF.
METHODS: Patients admitted between 1996 and 2017 because of ALF defined by 
Pediatric Acute Liver Failure criteria (raised transaminases, International 
Normal Ratio ≥2.0, no history of liver disease) were classified as ALF-CLD if 
diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, 
hepatitis B virus reactivation, inborn errors of metabolism. The others were 
classified as ALF.
RESULTS: Seventy-four children (median age, 4 years; 1.0-8.8; male/female, 
36/38] with ALF were found; 18 of <1 year of age were excluded. Fifty-six 
(median age, 6.6 years; 2.7-11.7; male/female, 23/33], 22 with ALF-CLD 
(autoimmune hepatitis, n = 14; Wilson disease, n = 6; inborn errors of 
metabolism, n = 2) and 34 with ALF (paracetamol overdose, n = 6; viral 
infections, n = 3; mushroom poisoning, n = 5; indeterminate, n = 20) were 
compared. In ALF-CLD, the median age at onset was higher, alanine 
aminotransferase, albumin, and International Normal Ratio levels were lower, 
splenomegaly, ascites, and cirrhosis were more common (all P < 0.01). On 
multivariate analysis, the diagnosis of ALF-CLD was an independent predictor of 
transplant-free survival (P = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: In children, ALF-CLD is common, has peculiar features, and is 
associated with a favorable outcome. This study suggests the need to distinguish 
this entity from other forms of ALF in children.

Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.

Germany.

BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that psychosocial working conditions may 
detrimentally affect diabetes self-management behavior at work, including 
self-monitoring of glucose levels. We aimed to better understand the potential 
usefulness of continuous glucose monitoring devices at the workplace according 
to employees with diabetes.
METHODS: We carried out secondary analyses of data from a qualitative study, 
which sought to explore potential barriers to and solutions for effective 
diabetes self-management at work. Interviews were carried out in face-to-face 
contact or by telephone and were transcribed and content-analyzed using MaxQDA. 
The used topic guide did not specifically inquire after continuous glucose 
monitoring devices, but views on the suitability of those devices at the 
workplace repeatedly emerged from the interviews. Data from 25 employed adults 
with diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2 on insulin therapy were included.
RESULTS: The major perceived improvements associated with the use of continuous 
glucose monitoring devices pertained to their time-saving application that 
allowed for an increased frequency of glucose level assessments and for socially 
covert glucose measurement. The socially less noticeable way of monitoring 
glucose level was specifically perceived as beneficial, as employees with 
diabetes believed their illness would thereby attract less attention. Fewer or 
shorter interruptions as well as the reliability of integrated alarm systems 
were perceived to increase concentration at work and workability.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous glucose monitoring devices were perceived to facilitate 
glucose management at the workplace, which may exert positive effects on 
compliance as well as functioning at work. Further research would be of interest 
to statistically confirm our findings in occupational samples.

OBJECTIVES: Assessing influence of anti-adalimumab (ADA) antibodies (AAA) on 
serum trough ADA levels and uveitis activity in long-term ADA treatment of 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis.
PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: This prospective observational study included 20 
patients from a single centre treated with ADA for active uveitis refractory to 
conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. AAA, serum ADA trough levels 
and uveitis activity were evaluated at regular intervals up to 6 years.
RESULTS: AAA were detected in nine patients (45%). Permanent AAA in seven were 
associated with undetectable ADA trough levels and loss of response (LOR). 
Transient AAA were detected in four with measurable ADA trough levels and 
response of uveitis to treatment, followed in two by permanent AAA associated 
with LOR. Use of concomitant immunosuppression was significantly higher in 
patients without AAA (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: AAA-associated LOR frequently occurs in long-term treatment with 
ADA for JIA-associated uveitis. Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy 
significantly reduces the risk of LOR due to AAA.

OBJECTIVES: Management of type 1 diabetes is often challenging. Smartphone 
mobile applications (apps) may provide additional support and help to improve 
glycemic control and clinical outcomes. The objectives of this study were to 
examine the literature evaluating the use of mobile apps (stand-alone and text 
messaging/feedback) in type 1 diabetes and to review top-rated mobile apps 
applicable to type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: Medline, Cochrane and Embase databases were systematically searched to 
identify studies published from inception to February 2018. Top-rated relevant 
apps from Google Play Store and Apple App Store were reviewed in July 2017.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 3,462 studies. Of these studies, 9 
evaluated the stand-alone apps; 3 showed significant improvement in glycated 
hemoglobin (A1C) levels (0.5%, p<0.05, 0.57%, p<0.05, and 0.58%, p=0.02); 3 
demonstrated improved adherence to glucose monitoring; and 1 study demonstrated 
a reduction in hypoglycemic events (glucose<3.0 mmol/L) in 6 of 10 participants 
who completed the study. Also, 5 studies evaluated a mobile app plus 
text-messaging/feedback system. Only 1 showed a significant reduction in severe 
hypoglycemic events (mobile app+text, IQR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.63; vs. 
control, IQR 2.29, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.91), while another single study demonstrated 
a reduction in median glycated hemoglobin levels (0.3%; p<0.001). Most top-rated 
mobile apps logged parameters relevant to diabetes management, and some provided 
graphic analysis and set reminders.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for larger and longer studies to 
explore the efficacy of apps to optimize outcomes in type 1 diabetes, the 
populations that would benefit most from these tools and the resources needed to 
support mobile apps plus text-messaging/feedback systems.

OBJECTIVE: Intensive self-monitoring of blood glucose levels by patients with 
diabetes achieves optimal glucose control, hence reducing the likelihood of 
complications.
METHODS: This is a prospective, cross-sectional study targeting adults with 
diabetes through community pharmacies and patient groups in Central and West 
London over a period of 10 weeks.
RESULTS: In all, 195 adults with diabetes were included in the analysis of the 
results. When monitoring adherence was examined, 43.4% (n=33/76) of participants 
with type 1 diabetes reported that their health care professionals had asked 
them to monitor their blood glucose levels between 3 and 4 times per day; 
however, 10% of this group was not following their health-care professionals' 
directions. Participants with type 2 diabetes were asked the same question; 
42.9% (n=51/119) were asked to monitor their blood glucose between 3 and 4 times 
a day, but only 2.5% (n=3/119) were following their health-care professionals' 
directions. When questioned about their reasons for poor adherence, the cohort 
indicated that it was due to the painful (29.2%, n=57/195), uncomfortable 
(33.8%, n=66/195) or inconvenient (36.9%, n=72/195) nature of testing. In 
addition, 75.3% (n=147/195) of the participants expressed their desire for a 
noninvasive monitoring device, and 74.3% (n=145/195) said they would be 
satisfied to use one of the preselected advanced technologies to monitor their 
blood glucose levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The favoured advanced technology, selected by 49.7% (n=97/195) of 
participants, was the wristband. Statistical significance was seen between the 
type of diabetes and the device selected; patients with type 1 diabetes 
preferred contact lenses (p<0.05) and tattoos (p<0.0001), whereas participants 
with type 2 diabetes preferred earlobe sensors (p<0.0001) and saliva analyzers 
(p<0.0001). Participants' gender, age and ethnicity also influenced device 
selection.

OBJECTIVES: Copeptin, a surrogate marker for vasopressin, is elevated in 
participants with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. Whereas adults 
with type 1 diabetes also demonstrate elevated copeptin concentrations and IR 
compared to controls without diabetes, the relationship between copeptin and IR 
in type 1 diabetes is unclear.
METHODS: Participants with (n=209) and without (n=244) type 1 diabetes in the 
Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study were assessed for 
serum copeptin, vitals, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio, glycated hemoglobin and lipid panels. Estimated 
insulin sensitivity (eIS) was calculated by validated equations in participants 
with and without type 1 diabetes. The relationships among copeptin, IR, waist 
circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) were examined with unadjusted and 
adjusted linear regression models.
RESULTS: Copeptin was correlated with eIS (R=-0.17, R2=0.029), WC (R=0.16, 
R2=0.026) and BMI (R=0.22, R2=0.048) for type 1 diabetes and with eIS (R=-0.37, 
R2=0.14), WC (R=0.40, R2=0.16) and BMI (R=0.25, R2=0.063) in non-type 1 
diabetes. In multivariable analysis, copeptin correlated with total cholesterol 
(beta±SE: -0.12±0.04, p=0.008) and low-density lipoprotein (beta±SE: -0.11±0.04, 
p=0.01) in type 1 diabetes. In non-type 1 diabetes, copeptin was associated with 
WC (beta±SE: 0.14±0.04, p=0.0024), BMI (beta±SE: 0.13±0.04, p=0.007) and eIS 
(beta±SE: -0.14±0.04, p=0.0013).
CONCLUSIONS: Copeptin does not correlate with markers of IR in type 1 diabetes 
but strongly correlates in non-type 1 diabetes. Thus, elevated vasopressin 
activity and IR appear to be independent risk factors for vascular complications 
in type 1 diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of two different 
task-oriented activity training programs on activity performance and 
participation in children/adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
DESIGN: Sixty-two patients were randomized into group I and group II for 
task-oriented activity training. In group I, activities of daily living were 
practiced using real materials from daily life, and in group II, activities of 
daily living were practiced using video-based games (Xbox 360 Kinect) for 3 d/wk 
for 8 wks. Pain by the Numeric Rating Scale, upper limb muscle, grip, and pinch 
strengths by a dynamometer, activity performance and participation by the 
Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, Canadian Occupational Performance 
Measure, and Duruoz Hand Index were evaluated.
RESULTS: After treatment in both groups, significant changes were found in the 
Numeric Rating Scale, muscle strength, grips strength, Childhood Health 
Assessment Questionnaire, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, and Duruoz 
Hand Index (P < 0.05). Group II was statistically superior to group I in changes 
of almost all upper limb muscle strengths, palmar pinch strength, Canadian 
Occupational Performance Measure satisfaction, and Duruoz Hand Index scores (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: Video games-based task-oriented activity training is an alternative 
and feasible treatment for children/adolescents with juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis. This new method may have widespread applicability in future research, 
given the rapidly growing interest in virtual reality-based therapy in 
rehabilitation.

OBJECTIVE: A close diabetes team-patient relationship is required for 
establishing satisfactory metabolic control. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the effect of a telehealth system on diabetes control.
METHODS: The study was carried out between June 2015 and January 2016 at the 
Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Endocrinology Department. The 
telehealth system was developed by the diabetes team. The demographic 
characteristics, frequency of use and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) changes of type 1 
diabetic (T1DM) patients using this communication network were analysed.
RESULTS: Eighty two patients [43 (52.4%) females, mean (±standard deviation) age 
10.89±4 years] used the telehealth system. Fourteen (17.1%) of the cases were on 
pump therapy and 59 (72.0%) were counting carbohydrates. The individuals with 
diabetes or their families preferred WhatsApp communication. Whatsapp provided a 
means for instant messaging in most instances (57.3%), contact with diabetes 
education nurse (32.9%) and consultation with the diabetes team about insulin 
doses and blood glucose regulation (42.7%). HbA1c values after six months were 
significantly lower in patients/parents calling frequently (p<0.001) compared 
with HbA1c values recorded at the beginning of the study.
CONCLUSION: Increase in frequency of counselling by the diabetes team led to 
improved blood glucose control in T1DM patients. A telehealth system is useful 
for early detection of the need for changes in treatment and for intervention. 
It also promoted better self care.

The immune system is a major contributor to brain homeostasis and pathogenesis 
of neurological diseases. However, the role of B lymphocytes (cells) in the 
brain is poorly understood. In this review, we describe the functions of the 
different subtypes of B cells in brain development and neurological diseases. B 
cells are classified into several subtypes according their function and gene 
expression. B-1a cells, which participate in innate immunity by producing 
natural antibodies, are abundant in the developing brain, and mediate 
oligodendrocyte development. In conditions such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis, 
spinal cord injury, and stroke, B-2 cells exacerbate the pathology by producing 
pathogenic autoantibodies. On the other hand, regulatory B cells suppress 
inflammation by secreting interleukin-10 and play beneficial roles in 
pathological conditions. Here, we summarize the distribution and function of B 
cells during brain development and neurological diseases.

Cardiovascular (CV) risk in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is increased. In 
this study, we evaluated the differences in major markers of CV risk between 
patients with T1DM and healthy controls by a systematic review and 
meta-analysis. Literature from PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library 
comparing CV risk markers between patients with T1DM and controls was obtained. 
The overall standard mean differences (SMDs) of carotid intima-media thickness 
(cIMT), endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD%), carotid-femoral 
pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), and glyceryl trinitrate-mediated dilatation (GTN%) 
with its 95% confidence interval (CI) between patients with T1DM and control 
groups were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effect model. Heterogeneity 
was evaluated using the Cochran Q and I2 statistics. The results showed that 
patients with T1DM had a significantly greater cIMT (SMD: 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.69-1.09; P < .001), significantly lower FMD% (SMD: -1.45%; 95% CI, -1.74 to 
-1.17; P < .001), significantly increased cf-PWV (SMD: 0.57; 95% CI, 0.03-1.11; 
P < .001), and significantly decreased GTN% (SMD: -1.11; 95% CI, -1.55 to -0.66; 
P < .001) than controls. Our results support the current evidence for an 
elevated CV burden in patients with T1DM and affirm the clinical utility of 
markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in the management of these patients.

OBJECTIVE: Polysymptomatic distress (PSD) is the underlying metric of 
fibromyalgia (FM), and levels of PSD can identify criteria-positive FM with > 
90% accuracy. We used levels of the PSD scale to test whether symptom levels in 
primary FM (PFM) and secondary FM (SFM) were the same and whether symptoms were 
equivalent in persons not meeting FM criteria.
METHODS: We studied 1525 patients with a clinical diagnosis of FM and 12,037 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We used regression models to compare 
patients with potential and actual PFM to RA patients with potential and actual 
SFM for 17 key clinical variables.
RESULTS: When controlled for PSD values, the widespread pain index, symptom 
severity scale, and pain, global, quality of life, and physical and mental 
component scores were essentially the same or only slightly different in PFM and 
SFM. Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index scores were slightly 
higher in SFM (0.21 units), as was the painful joint count (1.6 joints). 
Overall, higher PSD scores were associated with more severe symptoms or abnormal 
status. PSD scores in patients not satisfying FM criteria and in patients 
satisfying criteria operated similarly.
CONCLUSION: PFM and SFM are equivalent regarding symptom burden. PSD scores are 
more informative about severity and severity within diagnosis than 
dichotomization into FM/non-FM. Studies of FM versus "healthy individuals," or 
FM versus other diseases, are inherently defective, while studies of FM and PSD 
in RA offer the opportunity to have meaningful comparison groups, because there 
are no readily available unbiased appropriate controls for PFM.

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness. We 
systematically reviewed studies published from Jan 1, 1980, to Jan 7, 2018, 
assessed the methodological quality, and described variations in incidence of 
diabetic retinopathy by region with a focus on population-based studies that 
were conducted after 2000 (n=8, including two unpublished studies). Of these 
eight studies, five were from Asia, and one each from the North America, 
Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. The annual incidence of diabetic retinopathy 
ranged from 2·2% to 12·7% and progression from 3·4% to 12·3%. Progression to 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy was higher in individuals with mild disease 
compared with those with no disease at baseline. Our Review suggests that more 
high-quality population-based studies capturing data on the incidence and 
progression of diabetic retinopathy with stratification by age and sex are 
needed to consolidate the evidence base. Our data is useful for 
conceptualisation and development of major public health strategies such as 
screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy.

Several studies confirmed the association of HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 alleles with 
altered risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, data from individual studies 
based on small sample sizes yielded often conflicting findings in African Arabs. 
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at comprehensively 
evaluating this association with T1D, using molecular HLA data. Relevant studies 
were identified through systemic search of Medline/PubMed, Cochrane, Science 
Direct, ResearchGate, and EMBASE databases. Statistical analysis was carried out 
using RevMan, and Comprehensive Meta-analysis programs. Given the heterogeneity 
of African Arabs, we also performed subgroup analysis according to ethnicity. 
Analysis of sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias were performed to 
validate the outcome of the findings. This meta-analysis included 862 T1DM 
cases, along with 1,390 normoglycemic control, and comprised ten comparisons. 
Our study indicates that DRB1*03 (OR = 2.86), DRB1*04 (OR = 2.78), and DQB1*02 
(OR = 2.29), are positively associated with increased risk of T1DM, while 
DRB1*07 (OR = 0.48), DRB1*11 (OR = 0.20), DRB1*13 (OR = 0.47), DRB1*15 
(OR = 0.30), DQB1*05 (OR = 0.39), and DQB1*06 (OR = 0.27) were negatively 
associated with T1D, suggesting a protective role against T1D. This 
meta-analysis was characterized by low heterogeneity, sensitivity, and 
publication bias, indicating the robustness and reliability of the results.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate biochemical cartilage 
composition under methotrexate (MTX) therapy and to intra-individually assess 
the impact of inflammation severity on cartilage composition by using dGEMRIC 
MRI in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA).
METHODS: dGEMRIC of MCP joints of the index and middle finger of 28 patients 
from the AthroMark cohort were examined prior to MTX-therapy as well as after 3 
and 6 month. OMERACT RA MRI score and clinical parameters (CRP and DAS28) were 
registered at any time point. Each patient's second and third MCP joints were 
dichotomised into the joint with more severe synovitis versus the joint with 
less severe synovitis according to the RAMRIS synovitis subscore.
RESULTS: MCP joints with more severe synovitis ('bad joints') demonstrated 
significantly lower dGEMRIC values compared to MCP joints with less severe 
synovitis ('good joints') at time-points 0 and 3 months (p=0.002; p=0.019, 
respectively). After 6 months of MTX therapy no significant difference of 
dGEMRIC index was found between good and bad joint (p=0.086).
CONCLUSIONS: Under MTX therapy, biochemical cartilage integrity remains stable; 
no further cartilage destruction occurred if patients were treated early in the 
course of the disease. In addition, six months of MTX therapy triggered an 
alignment of dGEMRIC index of MCP joints with initially severe synovitis and 
less severe synovitis in an intra-individual assessment. This underlines the 
importance of an early treatment in eRA to reduce further cartilage damage of 
the inflamed joints.

INTRODUCTION: Cladribine Tablets (MAVENCLAD®) selectively reduce absolute 
lymphocyte counts (ALCs) in patients with multiple sclerosis. The recommended 
cumulative dose of Cladribine Tablets is 3.5 mg/kg over 4-5 days in months 1 and 
2 of treatment years 1 and 2, followed by prolonged efficacy with no additional 
treatment. After the cladribine-induced reduction, ALCs recover to normal within 
each treatment year in most patients. Those patients with slow ALC recovery can 
develop Grade 3-4 lymphopenia, especially those patients with Grade ≥  2 
lymphopenia at the start of year 2. Guidelines allowing treatment postponements 
during year 2 have been proposed for patients with a low ALC, subsequent to 
CLARITY, the pivotal clinical trial.
METHODS: A virtual population was generated using characteristics from CLARITY 
patients. A clinical trial simulation was performed to determine the impact of 
alternative treatment scenarios on ALC and relapse rate, by postponing treatment 
in year 2 to allow for longer ALC recovery time in patients who required it. 
Should a patient not recover to normal ALC (Grade 0) or Grade 1 lymphopenia 
within the period defined in the treatment algorithm, treatment in year 2 was 
suspended.
RESULTS: Results were similar across considered scenarios, which implemented 
different postponement durations. Specifically, ~  92% of virtual subjects did 
not require treatment postponement and <  1% discontinued due to Grade 2-4 
lymphopenia at the end of the maximally permitted postponement. Less severe 
lymphopenia was observed during year 2 when a treatment algorithm was applied. 
The effect on relapse rate over 2 years was negligible.
CONCLUSIONS: Results support treatment guidelines to decrease the risk of severe 
lymphopenia following treatment with Cladribine Tablets, while preserving 
efficacy.

Cladribine Tablets (MAVENCLAD®) are used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis 
(MS). The recommended dose is 3.5 mg/kg, consisting of 2 annual courses, each 
comprising 2 treatment weeks 1 month apart. We reviewed the clinical 
pharmacology of Cladribine Tablets in patients with MS, including 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacometric data. Cladribine Tablets are rapidly 
absorbed, with a median time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of 0.5 h 
(range 0.5-1.5 h) in fasted patients. When administered with food, absorption is 
delayed (median Tmax 1.5 h, range 1-3 h), and maximum concentration (Cmax) is 
reduced by 29% (based on geometric mean). Area under the concentration-time 
curve (AUC) is essentially unchanged. Oral bioavailability of cladribine is 
approximately 40%, pharmacokinetics are linear and time-independent, and volume 
of distribution is 480-490 L. Plasma protein binding is 20%, independent of 
cladribine plasma concentration. Cladribine is rapidly distributed to 
lymphocytes and retained (either as parent drug or its phosphorylated 
metabolites), resulting in approximately 30- to 40-fold intracellular 
accumulation versus extracellular concentrations as early as 1 h after 
cladribine exposure. Cytochrome P450-mediated biotransformation of cladribine is 
of minor importance. Cladribine elimination is equally dependent on renal and 
non-renal routes. In vitro studies indicate that cladribine efflux is minimally 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-related, and clinically relevant interactions with P-gp 
inhibitors are not expected. Cladribine distribution across membranes is 
primarily facilitated by equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) 1, 
concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) 3 and breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP), and there is no evidence of any cladribine-related effect on 
heart rate, atrioventricular conduction or cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval 
prolongation). Cladribine Tablets are associated with targeted lymphocyte 
reduction and durable efficacy, with the exposure-effect relationship showing 
the recommended dose is appropriate in reducing relapse risk.

BACKGROUND: Degludec is a long-acting insulin with a longer duration of action 
and a greater day-to-day reproducibility of absorption in comparison with 
previous long-acting insulin formulations. The aim is the definition of the 
change in insulin needs in patients switching from detemir/glargine to degludec 
in real-life conditions.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort observational study, all outpatients with 
either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, starting therapy with degludec insulin-after a 
prior treatment with either detemir or glargine insulin for at least 6 
months-were included.
RESULTS: The analysis was performed on 266 patients, 172 and 96 with type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes, respectively. The equations describing the relationship between 
baseline and follow-up doses of basal insulin (6 months) were Y = 3.39 + 0.78X 
and Y = 0.44 + 0.69X, in patients receiving detemir/glargine either once or 
twice daily, respectively (Y = degludec dose at 6 months and X = basal insulin 
dose at switch). The corresponding equations for prandial insulin doses were 
y = 1.83 + 0.83*x and y = 2.85 + 0.80*x for those on pre-switch once or 
twice-daily basal insulin, respectively. In type 2 diabetes, the switch was 
associated with a reduction of basal insulin doses only in those with a prior 
twice-daily treatment with basal insulin. The reduction of prandial insulin 
reached statistical significance only in patients previously treated with basal 
insulin once daily.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results provide a suggestion for a simple method for 
the adjustment of basal and prandial insulin doses in type 1 diabetic patients, 
switching from glargine or detemir to degludec.

BACKGROUND: The advent of newer second-line medical therapies (SLMT) for immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP) has contributed to decreased rates of splenectomy, 
following a trend to avoid or delay surgery. We aimed to characterize the 
long-term outcomes of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) for ITP at our institution, 
examining differences in LS efficiency when performed before or after SLMTs.
METHODS: Adults with primary ITP who underwent LS between 2002 and 2016 were 
identified. Retrospective review of electronic medical records was supplemented 
with telephone interviews. Treatment response was defined according to current 
guidelines as complete responders (CR), responders (R), and non-responders (NR). 
Kaplan-Meier estimates assessed relapse-free rates, and predictors of long-term 
response were investigated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: 109 patients met inclusion criteria, from which 42% were treated with 
an SLMT before referral to LS. LS was completed in all cases, with no 
conversions or intraoperative complications. The perioperative morbidity was 
7.3%, including 3 deep vein and 2 portal vein thrombosis, one reoperation for 
bleeding, and no mortalities. Splenectomy was initially effective in 99 patients 
(CR + R = 90.8%), and 10 patients were NR. At a median 62-month follow-up, 25 
patients relapsed, resulting in a 68% CR + R rate. Proportion of CR + R was 
similar in patients who previously received SLMT and those who did not (61 vs. 
76.7%, p = 0.08). CR + R patients were younger (45 vs. 53, p = 0.03), had higher 
preoperative platelet counts (36 vs. 19, p = 0.01), and experienced a higher 
increment in platelet counts during hospital stay (117 vs. 38, p < 0.001) as 
well as 30-days postoperatively (329 vs. 124, p < 0.001). Only a robust response 
in platelet count at 30-days postoperatively was independently associated with 
long-term response (OR 1.005, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: LS was curative in 68% of patients, with no statistically 
significant difference when performed before or after SLMTs. Outcomes remain 
challenging to predict preoperatively, with only a robust increase in platelet 
counts on short term being associated with long-term response.

It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of barrier disruption in 
the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The 
purpose of the present study was to clarify whether claudin-11 is involved in 
the disruption of two endothelial barriers (blood-brain barrier (BBB) and 
blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB)) and two epithelial barriers (blood-arachnoid 
barrier (BAB) and blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB)) in the CNS in MS. 
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that, in both normal human and mouse, 
claudin-11 is co-localized with claudin-5 in the brain and spinal cord 
capillaries. The absolute protein expression level of claudin-11 was nearly 
equal to that of claudin-5 in rat brain capillaries, but was 2.81-fold greater 
in human brain capillaries. The protein expressions of claudin-11 were 
significantly downregulated in the brain and spinal cord capillaries of an MS 
patient and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. Specific 
downregulation of claudin-11 with siRNA significantly increased the transfer of 
membrane-impermeable FITC-dextran across human brain capillary endothelial cell 
(hCMEC/D3) monolayer. As for the epithelial barrier, claudin-11 protein 
expression was not decreased in choroid plexus epithelial cells forming the 
BCSFB in EAE mice, whereas it was decreased in brain and spinal cord meninges 
that form the BAB. Specific downregulation of claudin-11 with siRNA in a rat 
choroid plexus epithelial cell (TR-CSFB) monolayer significantly increased the 
permeability of FITC-dextran. In conclusion, our present findings indicate that 
claudin-11 expression at the BBB, BSCB, and BAB, but not the BCSFB, is 
downregulated in multiple sclerosis, impairing the functional integrity of these 
barriers.

The expanding array of drugs available for treating rheumatoid arthritis is 
creating challenges in drug selection for the individual patient. The 
identification of biomarkers that predict the treatment response prior to drug 
exposure is therefore a current priority. This new approach, known as 
theranostics, is a component of personalized medicine, which involves selecting 
the management strategies that are most effective for a given patient at a given 
point in time. Antibodies to citrullinated peptides, rheumatoid factor, and the 
interferon signature are the most robust and best validated biomarkers 
identified to date. Matrices containing clinical or laboratory parameters of 
diagnostic or prognostic relevance may help to select the best treatment for the 
individual patient. Furthermore, the development of large-scale approaches 
requiring no a priori knowledge, such as functional genomics and metabolomics, 
hold considerable promise, despite persistent difficulties in replicating 
findings. The complexity of the treatment response in a given patient and 
substantial variability across patients suggest that biomarkers may be more 
helpful in combination than singly. The objectives of this review article are to 
discuss the approaches used to identify theranostic biomarkers and to present an 
overview of currently available biomarkers and of their performance in everyday 
clinical practice. However, the range of biomarkers suitable for use in daily 
practice remains extremely narrow.

Perianesthetic Implications and Considerations for Myasthenia Gravis.

Muckler VC, O'Brien JM, Matson SE, Rice AN.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease in which 
antibodies against the post-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the 
neuromuscular junction develop. Although the exact cause of MG remains unknown, 
the thymus is a common factor in many cases. Patients with underlying junctional 
disease, such as MG, have greater anesthesia-related risks because of their 
known predisposition toward prolonged muscle weakness. Medications given in the 
perioperative period, such as anesthetic agents, antibiotics, cardiovascular 
drugs, and corticosteroids, affect neuromuscular transmission that contributes 
to muscle weakness. Judicious use of neuromuscular blocking agents for patients 
with MG must be considered. This patient population is at high risk for 
respiratory failure, and therefore must be carefully assessed throughout the 
perioperative period to ensure that a regular spontaneous respiratory pattern is 
sufficient to provide adequate oxygenation. Perianesthesia providers must 
consider anesthetic, ventilatory, and pharmacologic implications when proposing, 
providing, and recovering anesthesia for the patient with MG.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: On April 14 and 16 2016, the Kumamoto area was severely 
damaged by several massive magnitude 7 class earthquakes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To examine the effects of these earthquakes on glycemic 
control and stress factors, glycated hemoglobin, glycated albumin, other 
biochemical parameters, a self-administered lifestyle-associated questionnaire 
and disaster-associated stress scores were analyzed. A total of 557 patients 
with diabetes were enrolled, and data were collected at 13 months before to 
13 months after the earthquakes.
RESULTS: In patients with type 1 diabetes and specific types of diabetes due to 
other causes, glycemic control was not altered during the observational period. 
This glycemic stability in type 1 diabetes might result from self-management of 
insulin doses. In patients with type 2 diabetes, glycated hemoglobin decreased 
by 0.11% (from 7.33 to 7.22%) at 1-2 months after the earthquakes, and increased 
thereafter. The reduction of glycated hemoglobin after 1-2 months in type 2 
diabetes was associated with 'early restoration of lifelines' and 'sufficient 
sleep.' The glycemic deterioration at a later stage was related to 'shortage of 
antidiabetic agents,' 'insufficient amount of food,' 'largely destroyed houses' 
and 'changes in working environments.' Disaster-associated stress levels were 
positively correlated with 'age,' 'delayed restoration of lifelines,' 
'self-management of antidiabetic agents' and 'increased amount of physical 
activity/exercise,' and negatively associated with 'early restoration of 
lifelines' and 'sufficient sleep.'
CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control, associated factors and stress levels are altered 
in chronological order. Post-disaster diabetic medical care must consider these 
corresponding points in accordance with the time-period.

End organ injury in diabetes mellitus (DM) is driven by microvascular compromise 
(including diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy). Cognitive impairment is a 
well-known complication of DM types 1 and 2; however, its mechanism(s) is(are) 
not known. We hypothesized that blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise plays a key 
role in cognitive decline in DM. Using a DM type 1 model (streptozotocin 
injected C57BL/6 mice) and type 2 model (leptin knockout obese db/db mice), we 
showed enhanced BBB permeability and memory loss (Y maze, water maze) that are 
associated with hyperglycemia. Gene profiling in isolated microvessels from DM 
type 1 animals demonstrated deregulated expression of 54 genes related to 
angiogenesis, inflammation, vasoconstriction/vasodilation, and platelet 
activation pathways by at least 2-fold (including eNOS, TNFα, TGFβ1, VCAM-1, 
E-selectin, several chemokines, and MMP9). Further, the magnitude of gene 
expression was linked to degree of cognitive decline in DM type 1 animals. Gene 
analysis in brain microvessels of DM type 2 db/db animals showed alterations of 
similar genes as in DM 1 model, some to an even greater extent. Neuropathologic 
analyses of brain tissue derived from DM mice showed microglial activation, 
expression of ICAM-1, and attenuated coverage of pericytes compared to controls. 
There was a significant upregulation of inflammatory genes in brain tissue in 
both DM models. Taken together, our findings indicate that BBB compromise in DM 
in vivo models and its association with memory deficits, gene alterations in 
brain endothelium, and neuroinflammation. Prevention of BBB injury may be a new 
therapeutic approach to prevent cognitive demise in DM.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) is a frequent problem in lupus patients, 
regardless of their overt neuropsychiatric (NP) involvement.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to test cognitive abilities in systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients by means of neuropsychological testing and 
event-related potentials (ERPs), and to search for their cognitive abilities 
correlations with a wide range of auto-antibodies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 37 SLE patients were subjected to a battery of 
neuropsychological tests, recommended by the American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR), and to ERPs. They were also tested for a wide range of auto-antibodies 
(anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2-GPI), lupus 
anticoagulant, anti-dsDNA, anti-nucleosome, anti-ribosomal P (anti-Rib-P), 
anti-ganglioside, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B.
RESULTS: Cognitive impairment was found in 35% of patients, mostly with NP SLE 
(NPSLE), and was associated with higher disease activity, measured by the SLE 
Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), and with a longer duration of central nervous 
system (CNS) involvement. There were no differences in the immunological status 
between CI patients and those without cognitive decline, but some antibodies 
were correlated with worse results in certain neuropsychological tests 
(anti-dsDNA and worse results of Rey Complex Figure Test - RCFTc for copying and 
RCFTr for recall, and of verbal fluency test (VFT); aCL IgG and worse results in 
Digit Span (DS) and in RCFTc). Event-related potentials showed prolonged N200 
and P300 latencies in SLE patients in comparison to controls, but no differences 
were found between SLE and NPSLE patients. Mean P300 latency was significantly 
longer in patients without anti-nucleosome antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Event-related potentials can be used as a complementary tool in 
assessing CI in SLE patients. The immunological status of patients with CI did 
not differ from that of patients without cognitive problems.

OBJECTIVES: The association of myasthenia gravis (MG) and inflammatory myositis 
(IM) is rare and typically only one of the diseases is present. The management 
of the 2 diseases differs, therefore it is important to recognize the 
concomitant presentation. Here, we report a case series of 7 patients with 
co-existing MG and IM with review of the literature.
METHOD: We identified 7 patients with concurrent MG and IM who were followed at 
the Neuromuscular Disease Program at a tertiary referral center in Vancouver, 
British Columbia from 2004 to 2017.
RESULT: All 7 patients had ocular or bulbar involvement as manifestation of MG. 
Three patients had simultaneous onset of MG and IM, 2 of whom presented with 
myasthenia crisis and fulminant myositis. In the other 4 patients, MG was the 
initial presentation and IM occurred 3-11 years after MG. Among these 7 
patients, 4 had underlying thymic pathology, including 2 with benign thymoma and 
2 with stage IV thymoma; all 4 patients had antibodies to acetylcholine receptor 
(AChR). Of the 3 patients with no thymic pathology by imaging or histology, 2 
had positive AChR antibody titer. For treatment, the thymoma was resected and 
chemotherapy was administered if appropriate. Additional immunosuppressive 
therapies including high-dose glucocorticoid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 
methotrexate, mycophenolate, or cyclosporine were necessary to achieve 
remission. Two patients with no thymoma had refractory MG and IM, and both 
responded to rituximab. We also conducted a literature review on the clinical 
characteristics and management of this condition, and compared the previously 
reported cases to the patients in our series.
CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest case series of MG-IM overlap with or 
without thymic pathology. In this cohort, the 2 disease entities can occur 
simultaneously, or one presents before the other. Most of the patients responded 
well to steroid, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and immunosuppressive agents. 
In very refractory cases, rituximab appeared to be effective, which has not been 
reported for the treatment of this condition before.

4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) is a recent treatment indicated to improve walking in 
patient with multiple sclerosis. We report the first case of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) that we attribute to the use of 4-AP. A 64-year-old woman 
with multiple sclerosis presented with dyspnea. After excluding other secondary 
causes of pulmonary hypertension, a diagnosis of severe PAH due to 4-AP was made 
based on right heart catheterization. History revealed that the dyspnea began 
with the initiation of 4-AP. After discontinuation of 4-AP therapy and 
initiation of ambrisentan and tadalafil, dyspnea and pulmonary arterial pressure 
have improved significantly and one specific PAH treatment was stopped. 4-AP is 
an outward rectifying potassium channel blocker with a vasoconstrictor effect in 
animal's pulmonary artery. According to the chronological sequence of events, 
the lack of other etiology, and its pharmacological plausibility, 4-AP is highly 
suspected to have induced our patient's PAH.

Despite an abundance of literature on the risk of a first venous thromboembolic 
event (VTE) in autoimmune diseases, specific recommendations about managing VTE 
in autoimmune diseases are lacking. This article aimed to collect evidence on 
the risk of recurrent VTE in patients with autoimmune diseases. The authors 
searched PubMed/Embase for studies including patients with VTE and autoimmune 
diseases as an exposure or studies including patients with autoimmune diseases 
in which recurrent VTE was one of the outcomes. Eleven articles were selected 
from 4,739 unique abstracts. Of the 11 studies, 3 reported time-dependent rates. 
Two studies collected rates of recurrence in Behcet's disease, reporting a 
5-year recurrence risk between 35 and 40%. However, the 5-year recurrence risk 
was lower than 10% in patients treated with immunosuppressant medication, while 
two studies suggested frequent recurrence in patients on only anticoagulant 
therapy. The other study reporting time-dependent incidence concerned patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease and index VTE. The 5-year risk of recurrent VTE 
was 33.4%, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.7 versus controls. All studies were 
retrospective and therefore risk may overestimate recurrence risk in comparison 
with known prospective cohort studies. There are insufficient data to make 
confident recommendations about the management of recurrent VTE prevention in 
patients with autoimmune diseases in general. The overall VTE risk profile, 
lower effectiveness of anticoagulants, and the observation that 
immunosuppression lowered risk of recurrence in patients with Behcet's disease 
seem to warrant immunosuppressant therapy over anticoagulation as a first 
consideration when preventing VTE recurrence in these patients.

PURPOSE: Venous thromboembolic events (VTE), with their life-threatening 
manifestation as pulmonary embolism, are potential adverse effects of 
intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse therapy, partially due to a 
hypercoagulable state. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of IVMP 
on selected hemostatic parameters in patients with moderate-to-severe Graves' 
orbitopathy (GO).
METHODS: 26 euthyroid patients with GO were treated with 12 pulses of IVMP 
(6 × 0.5, 6 × 0.25 g every week). Hemostatic variables [factor (F) II, FV, FVII, 
FVIII, fibrinogen, antithrombin, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 
prothrombin time, international normalized ratio of prothrombin time, platelets 
and D-dimer] were analysed before, 24 and 48 h after 1st, 6th and 12th pulse.
RESULTS: A constant, transient trend in changes of some hemostatic variables was 
observed after all assessed pulses. We discovered an increase in median activity 
of FVIII 24 and 48 h after pulses, with a shortening of aPTT 24 h after each 
IVMP pulse (p < 0.00005). FVII decreased 24 h after each pulse (p < 0.0005 after 
1st and 12th, p < 0.00005 after 6th). Fibrinogen level decreased 48 h after each 
pulse (P < 0.00005). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in 
hemostatic parameters in the long-term evaluation. Therapy was concluded in one 
patient after the 9th pulse due to pulmonary embolism.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase of FVIII activity is a consequence of treatment with 
IVMP and occurs after each pulse. In patients with additional risk factors of 
VTE, anticoagulation prophylaxis should be considered.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
associations between BRAFV600E mutation, the American College of Radiology (ACR) 
thyroid imaging, reporting and data system (TI-RADS) on ultrasound and 
clinicopathological characteristics in patients with a solitary papillary 
thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 397 patients with a 
solitary PTC, proved pathologically. BRAFV600E mutation status was detected in 
postoperative samples by real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction. 
Associations of BRAFV600E mutation with the ACR TI-RADS and clinicopathological 
characteristics were analyzed.
RESULTS: In this study, the incidence of BRAFV600E mutation was 81.4% (323/397) 
in patients with a solitary PTC. Univariate analyses showed that BRAFV600E 
mutation was significantly associated with margin, higher ACR TI-RADS point 
scores, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In multivariate analyses, lobulated or 
irregular margin was independently associated with BRAFV600E mutation in total 
solitary PTC. Furthermore, both in total solitary PTC and papillary thyroid 
microcarcinoma, BRAFV600E mutation was associated with ACR TI-RADS point scores, 
which was positively correlated with the risk of BRAFV600E mutation. There was 
no significant relationship between BRAFV600E mutation and ACR TI-RADS point 
scores in PTC >10 mm. In addition, Hashimoto's thyroiditis had a significant 
negative association with BRAFV600E mutation.
CONCLUSION: A lobulated or irregular margin of the thyroid nodule is 
independently associated with BRAFV600E mutation in patients with PTC. In 
addition, higher ACR TI-RADS point scores is an independent risk factor for 
BRAFV600E mutation, and ACR TI-RADS point scores is positively associated with 
the risk of BRAFV600E mutation in solitary PTC, especially in papillary thyroid 
microcarcinoma. Our findings may be helpful for preoperative identification and 
medical management of PTC patients with BRAFV600E mutation.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a combination of anti-rheumatic drugs is 
associated with the risk of coronary artery diseases (CAD) in incident 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
METHODS: This population-based cohort study used administrative data to identify 
6260 newly-diagnosed patients with RA (age ≥20 years) as the study group. The 
study end-point was occurrence of CAD according to the ICD-9-CM codes. Exposure 
to different combinations of drugs and the risk of CAD was assessed. These 
included different combinatiosn of celecoxib (Cx), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 
methotrexate (MTX), and sulfasalazine (SSZ). Patients who never used Cx, HCQ, 
MTX, or SSZ were used as a reference group. A Cox proportional hazards model was 
used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of disease after controlling for 
demographic and other co-morbidities. When the proportionality assumption was 
violated, the spline curve of the Scaled Schoenfeld residuals was fitted to 
demonstrate the estimated effect on CAD over time for drug usage.
RESULTS: Among RA patients, the adjusted HR (95% confidence interval) of CAD for 
"Cx only", "Cx and HCQ ever", and "Cx, HCQ, MTX, and SSZ ever", were 0.29 
(0.19-0.44), 0.46 (0.24-0.88), and 0.42 (0.24- 0.75), respectively, during the 
first period of 0-3, 4, or 7 years. However, they became 1.04 (0.78-1.38), 1.16 
(0.62-2.19), and 0.59 (0.32-1.08), respectively, during the second time period 
of 3, 4, or 7-10 years. The adjusted HR (95% CI) of CAD for "Cx, MTX, and SSZ 
ever" remains constant at 0.12 (0.02-0.89).
CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib-DMARDs drug combinations were associated with reduced CAD 
risk on incident RA patients, and some of them exhibited the time-varying drug 
effect.

OBJECTIVE: Data regarding the association between hypoglycemia and attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents with type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are limited. This study investigated whether 
hypoglycemia was associated with the risk of ADHD in young people with T1DM.
METHODS: Children and adolescents with a diagnosis of T1DM were identified from 
the Longitudinal National Health Insurance Database in Taiwan from 1998 to 2011. 
Among them who were newly diagnosed with hypoglycemia during 2000 to 2007 were 
selected for the hypoglycemia cohort. The hypoglycemia diagnosis date was 
defined as the index date. Those who were diagnosed with ADHD before the index 
date were excluded. The main outcome was the development of ADHD. In total, 726 
participants with hypoglycemia and 2852 participants without hypoglycemia were 
included in this study.
RESULTS: The overall incidence density of ADHD was markedly increased among 
cohort with hypoglycemia compared with cohort without hypoglycemia (4.74 vs 1.65 
per 1000 person-years), with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 2.73 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 1.50-4.98). Cohort with hypoglycemia who had 
experienced a hypoglycemic coma had a significantly higher risk of ADHD 
(aHR = 6.54, 95% CI = 1.89-22.7) compared with cohort without hypoglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypoglycemia, especially hypoglycemic coma, is significantly 
associated with a subsequent risk of ADHD in young people with T1DM.

Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil (DSS, GC); and Department of Physiotherapy at the 
Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil (SMS).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo 
exercise program on cognition and mobility in participants with multiple 
sclerosis.
DESIGN: This is a prospective, single-blind, controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: A community rehabilitation program within a large metropolitan health 
service.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients with multiple sclerosis were referred for 
outpatient rehabilitation.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were allocated to one of two groups and undertook a 
cognitive-motor exercise program or monitoring (control group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognition and mobility were the main outcome measures. 
Cognition was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Frontal 
Assessment Battery. Mobility was assessed with the Timed Get Up and Go test, 
applied with and without dual task distractors.
RESULTS: The findings showed benefits provided by exercise on cognition and 
mobility. Differently, participants of the control group did not have 
significant changes in cognition scores after 6 mos of follow-up and had a worse 
performance in mobility tests.
CONCLUSION: Six months of exercise provided benefits to cognition and mobility 
in adults with multiple sclerosis. This trial was registered prospectively with 
the Brazilian Clinical Trials Register, ID: RBR-9gh4km 
(http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/?q=RBR-9gh4km).

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) might be drug-induced. The present 
study evaluated the relationship between BP and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors (DPP4Is).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited patients diagnosed with BP at Ogaki 
Municipal Hospital from 1 December 2009 through 31 December 2017. We 
retrospectively collected data from medical records and divided patients into 
two groups based on whether they received DPP4Is. Additionally, we determined 
the incidence of BP in patients who were first prescribed DPP4Is at our hospital 
during the study period.
RESULTS: Of 168 patients diagnosed with BP, 133 (79.1%) were positive for 
anti-BP180NC16a antibody. A total of 32 (19.0%) patients had been prescribed a 
DPP4I, 21 of whom (65.6%) were positive for anti-BP180NC16a antibody; this rate 
was lower than that in patients not receiving a DPP4I (82.3%; P = 0.0360). A 
total of 16 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus had not been prescribed a 
DPP4I; only one (6.3%) was positive for anti-BP180NC16a antibody (P = 0.0339). 
During the study period, 9,304 patients were prescribed DPP4Is, eight of whom 
developed BP; six (75.0%) had non-inflammatory BP, and five of the six (83.3%) 
were negative for anti-BP180NC16a antibody.
CONCLUSIONS: The positive rate of anti-BP180NC16a antibody was lower in BP 
patients with DPP4I than without DPP4I, regardless of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
The antibody titer was low in both the overall and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
populations. The prevalence of BP in 9,304 patients receiving DPP4Is was 
0.0859%, which is higher than that in the general population. As DPP4Is are 
common diabetes treatments, we must be aware of the risk of BP.

Despite the now significant contribution of magnetic resonance imaging, the 
accurate and timely diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is still clinically 
challenging. Al Hussona et al., with their case series, highlight the 
complexities of attributing paroxysmal, and in particular cortical, symptoms 
such as epileptic seizures to inflammatory demyelinating lesions, and 
establishing a diagnosis of MS based on them. In such circumstances an MS 
diagnosis is likely to be more tentative than for more typical MS presentations, 
and treatment choices should be weighed accordingly.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epileptic seizures frequently occur in people with 
multiple sclerosis (MS) and are thought to represent a manifestation of cortical 
pathology. However, at present, seizures are not considered to be a typical 
clinical presentation of demyelination.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this case series, we identified four people, who 
presented with seizures as a sole presenting feature, with demyelinating imaging 
abnormalities that satisfy current diagnostic criteria for a clinically isolated 
syndrome (CIS) or early MS.
CONCLUSION: Based on this case series, we propose that people presenting with de 
novo seizures, with concurrent radiological abnormalities suggestive of 
demyelination could potentially be considered to have a CIS.

Auguste Renoir, Sculptor With Hired Hands: A Masterful Artistic Cooperation 
Overshadowed by Legal Issues and Copyright Infringement.

Zeidler HK(1).

Author information:
(1)From Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.

The coping with rheumatoid arthritis of the famous French impressionist painter 
Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919) is described in former publications. The 
heavily handicapped painter has in his last years created sculptures in 
cooperation with the sculptor Richard Guino (1890-1973). The extraordinary 
genesis of the sculptures through a masterful artistic cooperation, as well as 
the resulting legal issues and shameful copyright infringements, is reported. 
Renoir's decision to create sculptures with the help of Guido can be attributed 
to his remarkable artistic vision, vitality, optimistic nature, and strong will 
and is also a further testimonial of creative coping of an artist overcoming the 
physical handicap due to rheumatoid arthritis of his final years, so far not 
described in detail in the medical literature.

Patient-Reported Disease Activity and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Systemic 
Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: While increased rheumatic disease activity during pregnancy has been 
associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, this disease activity is typically 
assessed by physicians. Little is known, however, about the association between 
patient-reported measures of disease activity and pregnancy outcomes. The aim of 
our study was to evaluate this association.
METHODS: Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess the 
relationship between patient- and physician-reported measures of disease 
activity and adverse pregnancy outcomes in 225 patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The patients were enrolled 
from 2008-2016 in a prospective registry at a single academic center.
RESULTS: In women with RA, patient-reported disease activity was associated with 
preterm birth (odds ratio [OR] 5.9 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.5, 23.9]) 
and gestational age in weeks (β = -1.5 [95% CI -2.6, -0.4]). The physician 
assessment of disease activity also predicted preterm (OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.2, 
3.5]), small for gestational age births (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.03, 3.1]), and 
gestational age in weeks (β = -0.6 [95% CI -0.9, -0.02]). Alternatively, in 
women with SLE, patient-reported disease activity measures, including the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire, pain, or global health measures, were not associated 
with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, physician measures of SLE disease 
activity are associated with preterm birth (OR 2.9 [95% CI 1.3, 6.3]), cesarean 
delivery (OR 2.3 [95% CI 1.0, 5.3]), and preeclampsia (OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.3, 
6.3]). The results did not appear to be driven by lupus nephritis or 
antiphospholipid syndrome.
CONCLUSION: For women with RA, patient-reported measures of disease activity 
were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and thus may be useful adjuncts 
to physician-reported measures in identifying pregnancies at greater risk. In 
contrast, in SLE, while physician measures of disease activity helped predict 
several adverse pregnancy outcomes, no patient-reported measures were associated 
with adverse outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is often the presenting manifestation of 
giant cell arteritis (GCA). Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan often discloses the presence of 
large vessel vasculitis (LVV) in PMR patients. We aimed to identify predictive 
factors of a positive PET/CT scan for LVV in patients classified as having 
isolated PMR according to well-established criteria.
METHODS: A set of consecutive patients with PMR from a single hospital were 
assessed. All of them underwent PET/CT scan between January 2010 and February 
2018 based on clinical considerations. Patients with PMR associated to other 
diseases, including those with cranial features of GCA, were excluded. The 
remaining patients were categorized in classic PMR (if fulfilled the 2012 
EULAR/ACR classification criteria at disease diagnosis; n = 84) or atypical PMR 
(who did not fulfill these criteria; n = 16). Only information on patients with 
classic PMR was assessed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 84 patients (51 women) with classic PMR was 71.4 ± 
9.2 years. A PET/CT scan was positive in 51 (60.7%). Persistence of classic PMR 
symptoms was the most common reason to perform a PET/CT scan. Nevertheless, 
patients with positive PET/CT scan often had unusual symptoms. The best set of 
predictors of a positive PET/CT scan were bilateral diffuse lower limb pain (OR 
= 8.8, 95% CI: 1.7-46.3; p = 0.01), pelvic girdle pain (OR = 4.9, 95% CI: 
1.50-16.53; p = 0.01) and inflammatory low back pain (OR = 4.7, 95% CI: 
1.03-21.5; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Inflammatory low back pain, pelvic girdle and diffuse lower limb 
pain are predictors of positive PET/CT scan for LVV in PMR.

OBJECTIVES: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis-a primary systemic vasculitis-most 
frequent manifestations are respiratory. Airway disease can present with 
stenosis, and although subglottic stenosis (SGS) is well described, narrowing 
distal to the glottis has been more recently the focus of reporting. Our 
objectives, therefore, are to describe the frequency, characteristics, and 
treatment of tracheobronchial stenoses (TBS) in granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
(GPA) at our institution, a national referral center for respiratory diseases. 
Also, to identify factors associated with TBS development in GPA.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of all identified TBS cases (n-29) 
in whom their demographics, clinical and paraclinical features, and treatment 
were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Comparisons between those who 
developed and did not develop TBS (n-79) were established with the χ2 test with 
Yates correction or two-tailed exact Fisher test for comparisons among groups 
with or without this complication.
RESULTS: Females were predominantly affected by TBS (76%). Most patients had 
limited GPA (n-20, 69%). TBS appeared at a mean of 29 months after diagnosis of 
GPA. Main symptoms were dysphonia, stridor, and dyspnea. All TBS patients had 
tracheal involvement and 12 (41%) additional bronchial stenoses. Other 
accompanying manifestations by organ/system were rhinosinusal (n-26, 87%), 
musculoskeletal (n-16, 55%), ocular (n-13, 45%), pulmonary (n-12, 41%), renal 
(n-8, 27%), mucocutaneous (n-5, 17%), neurological (n-4, 13%). At TBS diagnosis, 
17 patients were PR3-ANCA and/or C-ANCA positive, while 9 were MPO-ANCA and/or 
P-ANCA positive; results on the remaining were either negative or ANCA were not 
performed at that time. Seventeen patients had simultaneous medical (8 with 
glucocorticoid therapy, 9 with immunosuppressants) and surgical therapy, while 
the rest only the latter at the time of TBS diagnosis. Relapses were frequent 
(one in 18 patients; two in 11, three in 9 and 2 individuals had ≥4 relapses). 
Factors positively associated with TBS were the presence of general and 
musculoskeletal symptoms and rhinosinusal disease, while those negatively 
associated were prednisone oral daily dose >10mgqd and azathioprine intake. The 
extent of disease, either generalized or limited was not associated with TBS 
development, nor were ANCA levels.
CONCLUSIONS: TBS are serious complications of GPA which can arise at any stage 
of the disease. Timely diagnosis plus optimal treatment and follow-up remain 
unmet needs.

BACKGROUND: Pemphigus is a chronic potentially life-threatening autoimmune 
blistering disease affecting the skin and/or mucous membranes. Rituximab is 
being increasingly used and found efficacious in the treatment of pemphigus.
OBJECTIVE: To present the Middle-Eastern experience with the use of rituximab in 
pemphigus.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patient files was conducted which revealed 
23 patients of pemphigus who were treated with rituximab (either alone or with 
IVIG) in the dermatology department of a tertiary care hospital from July 2004 
to December 2014.
RESULTS: The mean time to disease control was 8 weeks (median 5 weeks and range 
2-30 weeks). 90.9% attained early study end point with the first cycle of 
rituximab. The remaining 9.1% needed an additional course of rituximab + IVIG to 
attain disease control. 90.5% of our patients attained complete remission during 
the study period. The average time to attain complete remission on minimal 
treatment was 25.4 weeks and partial remission on minimal treatment was attained 
after a mean period of 18.3 weeks. Rituximab was well tolerated by our patients 
and the rate of adverse-effects in our cohort was comparable to the previous 
reports.
CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab is an effective and safe treatment for pemphigus and 
should be considered earlier in the algorithm of pemphigus treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) directed to proteinase 3 
(PR3) used to be considered the serologic marker for granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA). However, patients with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA positive 
GPA have been increasingly reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
clinical and pathological characteristics and outcome of Chinese patients with 
MPO-ANCA positive GPA.
METHODS: The clinical and renal histology data, renal outcomes, response to 
treatment, relapse and mortality were compared between patients with MPO-ANCA 
positive GPA and MPO-ANCA positive microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) as well as 
proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA positive GPA.
RESULTS: 455 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) were recruited in 
this study. 276/455 patients were classified as MPO-ANCA positive MPA, 4/455 
patients were classified as PR3-ANCA positive MPA, 124/455 were MPO-ANCA 
positive GPA and 51/455 were PR3-ANCA positive GPA. Compared with MPO-ANCA 
positive MPA patients, MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients had significantly higher 
level of BVAS and milder renal lesion at diagnosis. The probability of 
developing ESRD was significantly higher in patients with MPO-ANCA positive MPA 
than MPO-ANCA positive GPA. MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients were likely to have 
relapse than MPO-ANCA positive MPA patients. Compared with PR3-ANCA positive GPA 
patients, MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients had significantly higher proportion of 
female, less constitutional symptoms and milder renal lesion at diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MPO-ANCA positive GPA should be regarded as a unique 
subset of AAV. This subset of AAV patients had relatively milder renal injury. 
Although ANCA specificities play an important role in differentiating AAV, 
taking the disease type together to classify AAV may be more rational.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether gout is associated with a higher or lower risk of 
a new diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in older adults, adjusting for 
known risk factors of GCA.
METHODS: We used the 5% Medicare claims to conduct a multivariable Cox 
regression analyses to assess the association of gout with incident GCA in 
adults 65 years or older adjusting for age, gender, race (known risk factors for 
GCA) and Charlson-Romano comorbidity score, the use of medications for 
cardiovascular diseases (statins, beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE-inhibitors) and 
gout (allopurinol, febuxostat). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: There were 3004 incident cases (new diagnosis) of GCA with crude 
incidence rates of GCA of 28.0/100,000 person-years in patients without gout and 
63.8/100,000 person-years in patients with gout. Multivariable-adjusted analyses 
showed that preexisting gout was associated with a higher risk of incident/new 
GCA diagnosis with a hazard ratio of 2.05 (95% CI: 1.76, 2.40), confirmed in 
sensitivity analyses that substituted continuous Charlson-Romano comorbidity 
score with categorized score or individual comorbidities (plus hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease). Older age, female gender, white 
race and higher comorbidity index, were also associated with a higher hazard of 
GCA. Subgroup analyses did not show any significant variation of the association 
of preexisting gout with incident GCA by age, race or sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Gout was associated with more than 2-fold higher risk of incident 
GCA in older adults, independent of known risk factors of GCA. Future studies 
should explore the underlying mechanisms for this association.

METHODS: Twenty-three patients who met the criteria proposed by the OMAAV study 
group were included. RTX was used for patients who had difficulty achieving 
induction of remission using glucocorticoids (GC) and intravenous 
cyclophosphamide (IVCY).
RESULTS: Six patients were treated with RTX (RTX group), while 17 patients did 
not require RTX for induction of remission (non-RTX group). All six patients in 
the RTX group achieved remission. Age, sex, and months from onset to diagnosis 
did not differ significantly between the groups. The air-conduction hearing 
thresholds at diagnosis and remission were 71.7±6.3dB and 50.1±5.1dB in the RTX 
group, and 56.8±4.8dB and 35.8±4.8dB in the non-RTX group, respectively. Hearing 
level at remission was significantly better in the non-RTX group (p<0.05), while 
hearing gain did not differ significantly between the groups. Infectious 
complications were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RTX is effective and safe for intractable 
OMAAV patients who have a poor response to GC and IVCY.

OBJECTIVES: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi) are effective 
treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Responses to treatment are barely 
predictable. As these treatments are costly and may induce a number of side 
effects, we aimed at identifying a panel of protein biomarkers that could be 
used to predict clinical response to TNFi for RA patients.
METHODS: Baseline blood levels of C-reactive protein, platelet factor 4, 
apolipoprotein A1, prealbumin, α1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, S100A8/A9 and 
S100A12 proteins in bDMARD naive patients at the time of TNFi treatment 
initiation were assessed in a multicentric prospective French cohort. Patients 
fulfilling good EULAR response at 6 months were considered as responders. 
Logistic regression was used to determine best biomarker set that could predict 
good clinical response to TNFi.
RESULTS: A combination of biomarkers (prealbumin, platelet factor 4 and S100A12) 
was identified and could predict response to TNFi in RA with sensitivity of 78%, 
specificity of 77%, positive predictive values (PPV) of 72%, negative predictive 
values (NPV) of 82%, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 3.35 and negative 
likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.28. Lower levels of prealbumin and S100A12 and 
higher level of platelet factor 4 than the determined cutoff at baseline in RA 
patients are good predictors for response to TNFi treatment globally as well as 
to Infliximab, Etanercept and Adalimumab individually.
CONCLUSION: A multivariate model combining 3 biomarkers (prealbumin, platelet 
factor 4 and S100A12) accurately predicted response of RA patients to TNFi and 
has potential in a daily practice personalized treatment.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor has been proven to improve 
glycemic control and β-cell function in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults 
(LADA). The potential immune modulation mechanism is still unknown. Thus, we 
tested T-lymphocyte subsets and expression of relevant transcription factors in 
LADA patients with sitagliptin intervention for up to 1-year.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 LADA patients were randomly assigned to 
sitagliptin and/or insulin treatment (SITA group; n = 20) or insulin alone 
treatment (CONT group; n = 20). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated 
at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. The percentage of T-lymphocyte subsets (T 
helper 1, T helper 2, T helper 17 and regulatory T cells) tested by flow 
cytometry, and the messenger ribonucleic acid expression (T box expressed in T 
cells [T-BET], GATA binding protein 3 [GATA3], forkhead box protein 3 [FOXP3] 
and related orphan receptor C [RORC]) tested by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction were determined at baseline, 6 months and 12 months.
RESULTS: The percentage of regulatory T cells in the SITA group was 
significantly lower than that of the CONT group at baseline. The percentage of T 
helper 2 cells was higher than that of the CONT group at 6 months and 12 months. 
At 12 months, the percentage of T helper 17 cells was lower in the SITA group 
than that of the CONT group. After a 1-year visit, the messenger ribonucleic 
acid expression levels of T-BET expressed in T cells and RORC in the SITA group 
were significantly lower than at baseline. Whereas that of RORC in the CONT 
group were significantly lower than that at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: The data confirmed that sitagliptin altered the phenotype of T 
cells and downregulated the expression of T-BET and RORC in LADA patients, and 
ameliorated glycemic control in LADA patients.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate large-vessel (LV) abnormalities on serial imaging in 
patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and discern predictors of new lesions.
METHODS: Clinical and imaging data from patients with GCA (including subjects 
diagnosed by LV imaging) enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal 
study and/or a randomized clinical trial were included. New arterial lesions 
were defined as a lesion in a previously unaffected artery.
RESULTS: The study included 187 patients with GCA, 146 (78%) female, mean (±SD) 
age at diagnosis 68.5 ± 8.5 years; 39% diagnosed by LV imaging. At least one 
arterial lesion was present in 123 (66%) on the first study. The most frequently 
affected arteries were subclavian (42%), axillary (32%), and thoracic aorta 
(20%). In 106 patients (57%) with serial imaging, new arterial lesions were 
noted in 41 patients (39%), all of whom had a baseline abnormality, over a mean 
(±SD) follow-up of 4.39 (2.22) years. New abnormalities were observed in 33% 
patients by year 2; clinical features of active disease were present at only 50% 
of these cases. There were no differences in age, sex, temporal artery biopsy 
positivity, or disease activity in patients with or without new lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with GCA, LV abnormalities on first 
imaging were common. Development of new arterial lesions occurred in patients 
with arterial abnormalities at first imaging, often in the absence of symptoms 
of active disease. Arterial imaging should be considered in all patients with 
GCA at diagnosis and serial imaging at least in patients with baseline 
abnormalities.

In multiple sclerosis patients, demyelination is prominent in both the white and 
gray matter. Chronic clinical deficits are known to result from acute or chronic 
injury to the myelin sheath and inadequate remyelination. The underlying 
molecular mechanisms of remyelination and its failure remain currently unclear. 
Recent studies have recognized G protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) as an 
important regulator of oligodendrocyte development and remyelination. So far, 
the relevance of GPR17 for myelin repair was mainly tested in remyelinating 
white matter lesions. The relevance of GPR17 for gray matter remyelination as 
well as remyelination of chronic white matter lesions was not addressed so far. 
Here, we provide a detailed characterization of GPR17 expression during 
experimental de- and remyelination. Experimental lesions with robust and limited 
endogenous remyelination capacity were established by either acute or chronic 
cuprizone-induced demyelination. Furthermore, remyelinating lesions were induced 
by the focal injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the corpus 
callosum. GPR17 expression was analyzed by complementary techniques including 
immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and real-time PCR. In control 
animals, GPR17+ cells were evenly distributed in the corpus callosum and cortex 
and displayed a highly ramified morphology. Virtually all GPR17+ cells also 
expressed the oligodendrocyte-specific transcription factor OLIG2. After acute 
cuprizone-induced demyelination, robust endogenous remyelination was evident in 
the white matter corpus callosum but not in the gray matter cortex. Endogenous 
callosal remyelination was paralleled by a robust induction of GPR17 expression 
which was absent in the gray matter cortex. Higher numbers of GPR17+ cells were 
as well observed after LPC-induced focal white matter demyelination. In 
contrast, densities of GPR17+ cells were comparable to control animals after 
chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination indicating quiescence of this cell 
population. Our findings demonstrate that GPR17 expression induction correlates 
with acute demyelination and sufficient endogenous remyelination. This 
strengthens the view that manipulation of this receptor might be a therapeutic 
opportunity to support endogenous remyelination.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) often starts in the form of clinically isolated syndrome 
(CIS) and only some of the CIS patients progress to relapsing-remitting MS 
(RRMS). Biomarkers to predict conversion from CIS to MS are thus greatly needed 
for making correct treatment decisions. To identify a predictive cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) protein, we analyzed the first-attack CSF samples of CIS patients 
who converted (CIS-MS) (n = 23) and did not convert (CIS-CIS) (n = 19) to RRMS 
in a follow-up period of 5 years using proteomics analysis by liquid 
chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and verified by ELISA. 
Label-free differential proteomics analysis of CSF ensured that 637 proteins 
were identified and 132 of these proteins were found to be statistically 
significant. Further investigation with the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) 
software led to identification of three pathway networks mostly comprised 
proteins involved in inflammatory response, cellular growth and tissue 
proliferation. CSF levels of four of the most differentially expressed proteins 
belonging to the cellular proliferation network function, chitinase-3-like 
protein 1 (CHI3L1), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 21 
(TNFRSF21), homeobox protein Hox-B3 (HOXB3) and iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS), 
were measured by ELISA. CSF levels of HOXB3 were significantly increased in 
CIS-MS patients. Our results indicate that cell and tissue proliferation 
functions are dysregulated in MS as early as the first clinical episode. HOXB3 
has emerged as a potential novel biomarker which might be used for prediction of 
CIS-MS conversion.

PURPOSE: To present the outcomes of ultrasound (US) follow-ups in children with 
autoimmune thyroid disease who did not have a thyroid nodule on admission but 
developed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and to characterize the parenchymal 
changes in the thyroid gland prior to the development of PTC.
METHODS: A retrospective thyroid US scan review of 327 patients diagnosed with 
AIT was performed. Forty patients (40/327, 12.2%) presented nodular AIT variant 
with a normoechogenic background. Eleven patients (11/327, 3.4%, 11/40, 27.5%) 
presenting this variant were diagnosed with PTC (nine females-mean age 
15.3 years; two males aged 11 and 13 years). In five of 11 patients, the 
suspicious nodule that was later confirmed to be PTC was detected on the initial 
US at presentation. For the remaining six females (6/11) who developed PTC 
during the follow-up, we retrospectively analysed their US thyroid scans and 
these patients were selected for analysis in this study.
RESULTS: On admission, the US evaluation revealed an enlarged normoechogenic 
thyroid gland in three patients and a hypoechogenic thyroid gland with fibrosis 
as indicated by irregular, chaotic hyperechogenic layers in three patients. No 
thyroid nodules were identified. Ultrasound monitoring revealed increasing 
echogenicity of the thyroid parenchyma during the follow-up. PTC developed in a 
mean time of 4.6 years (1 9/12-7 4/12 years) since referral to the outpatient 
thyroid clinic and 2.9 years (6/12-6 9/12) since the last nodule-free US thyroid 
scan.
CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic follow-up assessments warrant further exploration as a 
strategy to determine PTC susceptibility in the paediatric population.

Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder with frequent clinical 
manifestation of arterial, venous or small vessel thromboembolic events and/or 
foetal morbidity. Hereby, we present a case report of a patient with a large 
arterial thrombus originating from the ostium of the right coronary artery 
accompanied by multiple systemic embolization and right ventricular failure. As 
a bridge-to-recovery strategy, an extracorporeal right ventricular assist device 
was successfully applied, representing an effective first choice option in 
selected patients with isolated acute right heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of ultraviolet exposure, climate 
factors and pollutants on pemphigus.
AIM: To determine whether these factors are associated with pemphigus 
exacerbation resulting in hospitalization.
METHODS: The analysis used data from the 2002-2012 National Inpatient Sample in 
the USA, including 68 476 920 children and adults, and measurements of relative 
humidity (%), ultraviolet (UV) index, outdoor air temperature and particulate 
matter of ≤ 2.5 or ≤ 10 μm (PM2.5 and PM10).
RESULTS: Higher rates of admission primarily for pemphigus occurred during the 
summer and autumn months (June-November), with the highest admission rates in 
July and October (both 19.7 per million). There was significant statewide 
variation of the prevalence of hospitalization for pemphigus, with apparent 
hotspots located in the southwest and northeast states. Hospitalization for a 
primary diagnosis of pemphigus vs. other diagnosis was associated with 
significantly lower humidity [mean (95% confidence interval): 64.8% (63.2-66.4%) 
vs. 66.4% (65.6-67.3%); analysis of variance, P < 0.01) and higher temperature 
[58.7 (57.1-60.2) vs. 56.3 (55.8-56.7)°F, P = 0.001], UV index [6.0 (5.7-6.2) 
vs. 5.7 (5.6-5.7), P = 0.02], PM2.5 [12.9 (12.0-13.7) vs. 11.8 (11.5-12.0) mg/m3 
, P < 0.001] and PM10 [26.2 (24.5-27.9) vs. 23.1 (22.6-23.6) mg/m3 , P < 0.001]. 
All associations remained significant in multilevel regression models that 
controlled for age, sex and race/ethnicity, except for ultraviolet index, which 
was associated with pemphigus hospitalization only for Hispanic patients [odds 
ratio (95% CI) for quartile 4: 2.07 (1.02-4.21)].
CONCLUSION: Increasing temperature, UV exposure and small particle air pollution 
are associated with increased hospitalization for pemphigus. Patients with 
pemphigus may benefit from avoidance of these potential environmental triggers.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coeliac disease (CD) is more common in those with type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and may be asymptomatic despite the presence of 
intestinal histological changes. Optimal screening practice guidelines differ 
internationally. We undertook a retrospective audit to determine the efficacy of 
current screening practice for CD in T1DM in our centre.
METHODS: All children and adolescents < 16 years, diagnosed with T1DM in our 
service and continuing to attend the service in January 2017 were included. Data 
on CD screening was collected and compared to current NICE, NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Of the 355 patients attending our service, 253 attended from T1DM 
diagnosis and all had CD screening performed in our centre. In 37 of 253 
patients, IgA-TTG was positive, providing a cumulative prevalence of 14.6%. Of 
these, 31(83.78%) with an elevated TTG on screening had no recorded 
gastrointestinal symptoms or CD-related clinical signs. Of the 35 TTG plus 
EMA-positive patients, 22/35 (59.46%) had diagnostic endoscopic biopsy. Nineteen 
(83.4%) had CD confirmed, 1 (4.54%) had negative biopsy and 2 (9%) had 
equivocal, non-diagnostic changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Timely diagnosis of CD can prevent chronic ill health in affected 
individuals, and in patients with T1DM, CD is an independent risk factor for 
increased morbidity and mortality. Given the high prevalence of atypical 
symptoms and silent CD in those with T1DM, in this and other studies, and the 
benefits of detection and treatment of CD, screening is essential. Large-scale 
data collection allowing for the development of evidence-based guidelines is 
required.

OBJECTIVE: MRI-detected inflammation is considered of diagnostic value for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its evaluation involves a time-consuming scoring 
of 61 joint-level features. It is not clear, however, which of these features 
are specific for RA and whether evaluating a subset of specific features is 
sufficient to differentiate RA patients. This study aimed to identify a subset 
of RA-specific features in a case-control setting and validate them in a 
longitudinal cohort of arthralgia patients.
METHODS: The difference in frequency of MRI-detected inflammation (bone marrow 
edema, synovitis, and tenosynovitis) between 199 RA patients and 193 controls 
was studied in 61 features across the wrist, metacarpophalangeal, and 
metatarsophalangeal joints. A subset of RA-specific features was obtained by 
applying a cutoff on the frequency difference while maximizing discriminative 
performance. For validation, this subset was used to predict arthritis 
development in 225 clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) patients. Diagnostic 
performance was compared to a reference method that uses the complete set of 61 
features normalized for inflammation levels in age-matched controls.
RESULTS: Subset of 30 features, mainly (teno)synovitis, was obtained from the 
case-control setting. Validation in CSA patients yielded an area of 0.69 (95% 
CI: 0.59-0.78) under the ROC curve and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 31%, 
compared to 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60-0.77) and 29% PPV of the reference method with 61 
features.
CONCLUSION: Subset of 30 MRI-detected inflammatory features, dominated by 
(teno)synovitis, offers a considerable reduction of scoring efforts without 
compromising accuracy for prediction of arthritis development in CSA patients.

BACKGROUND: The antigenic trigger that drives expansion of circulating 
plasmablasts and CD4+ cytotoxic T cells in patients with IgG4-related disease 
(IgG4-RD) is presently unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to sequence immunoglobulin genes from single-cell clones of 
dominantly expanded plasmablasts and generate recombinant human mAbs to identify 
relevant antigens in patients with IgG4-RD by using mass spectrometry.
METHODS: Paired heavy and light chain cDNAs from dominant plasmablast clones 
were expressed as mAbs and used to purify antigens by using immunoaffinity 
chromatography. Affinity-purified antigens were identified by using mass 
spectrometry and validated by means of ELISA. Plasma levels of the antigen of 
interest were also determined by using ELISA.
RESULTS: mAbs expressed from the 2 dominant plasmablast clones of a patient with 
multiorgan IgG4-RD stained human pancreatic tissue sections. Galectin-3 was 
identified as the antigen specifically recognized by both mAbs. Anti-galectin-3 
autoantibody responses were predominantly of the IgG4 isotype (28% of the 
IgG4-RD cohort, P = .0001) and IgE isotype (11% of the IgG4-RD cohort, 
P = .009). No significant responses were seen from the IgG1, IgG2, or IgG3 
isotypes. IgG4 anti-galectin-3 autoantibodies correlated with increased plasma 
galectin-3 levels (P = .001), lymphadenopathy (P = .04), total IgG level 
increase (P = .05), and IgG4 level increase (P = .03).
CONCLUSION: Affinity chromatography using patient-derived mAbs identifies 
relevant autoantigens in patients with IgG4-RD. IgG4 galectin-3 autoantibodies 
are present in a subset of patients with IgG4-RD and correlate with galectin-3 
plasma levels. The marked increases in levels of circulating IgG4 and IgE 
observed clinically are, at least in part, caused by the development of IgG4- 
and IgE-specific autoantibody responses.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) has paradoxically been found to be able to both activate 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as inhibit MMPs. However, these 
regulatory effects have not yet been observed in vivo, and it is unclear which 
pathway is relevant in vivo. We aim to track MPO regulation of MMP activity in 
living animals in neuroinflammation. Mice induced with experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of neuroinflammation and multiple 
sclerosis, were treated with either the MPO-specific inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic 
acid hydrazide or saline as control. Mice underwent concurrent magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) with the MPO-specific molecular imaging agent MPO-Gd and 
fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) with the MMP-targeting agent MMPsense on 
day 12 after induction. Biochemical and histopathological correlations were 
performed. Utilizing concurrent MRI and FMT imaging, we found reduced MMP 
activity in the brain with MPO inhibition, demonstrating MPO activity positively 
regulates MMP activity in vivo. In vivo MMPSense activation and MMP-9 activity 
correlated with MPO-Gd+ lesion volume and disease severity. This was 
corroborated by in vitro assays and histopathological analyses that showed MMP 
activity and MMP-9+ cells correlated with MPO activity and MPO+ cells. In 
conclusion, multimodal molecular imaging demonstrates for the first time MPO 
regulation of MMP activity in living animals. This approach could serve as a 
model to study the interactions of other biologically interesting molecules in 
living organisms.

OBJECTIVE: Fasting from dawn to dusk during Ramadan, including abstaining from 
water and food, is 1 of the pillars of Islam and is observed by the majority of 
Muslims. Most research concerning diabetes and fasting during Ramadan originates 
from Middle Eastern or South Asian countries; however, differences exist in 
hours of work and fasting, pharmacotherapy and blood glucose monitoring between 
these countries and Canada.
METHODS: An expert forum of 7 Canadian experts and 1 international expert 
collaborated to develop Canadian guidelines using the same evidence-based 
principles, with the exception of an independent methods review used for the 
Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines. Diabetes Canada scientific 
leadership and Canadian health-care providers performed independent external 
reviews. Religious leaders endorsed the position statement and provided letters 
of support. An informed patient participated in the position-statement 
development. Each recommendation was approved with 100% consensus of the expert 
forum.
RESULTS: Recommendations for risk stratification, education, pharmacotherapy and 
blood glucose monitoring for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who intend 
to fast during Ramadan have been developed.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Canadian position statement on the topic of 
Ramadan fasting and diabetes. It was developed by an expert faculty and endorsed 
by Diabetes Canada, and provides guidance about pharmacotherapy and glucose 
monitoring for health-care providers so that they can assist Canadian Muslims 
living with diabetes to observe fasting during Ramadan safely.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Infectious intracranial aneurysms are a rare subset 
of intracranial aneurysms caused by bacterial, fungal, or viral sources. 
Intracranial aneurysms of fungal etiology carry a high mortality risk and 
typically occur in immunocompromised patients via direct extension of skull base 
infections, or more rarely, after intracranial surgery.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 27-yr-old female with systemic 
lupus erythematous and primary pulmonary mucormycosis, who suffered a 
subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured fusiform distal middle cerebral artery 
aneurysm. Despite undergoing a successful extracranial-to-intracranial bypass 
and aneurysm excision, the patient ultimately died following progressive 
disseminated infection and a secondary intracranial hemorrhage of unknown 
etiology. Pathological examination of the excised artery confirmed Mucor 
infection.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this case represents one of the first 
mycotic cerebral aneurysms from mucormycosis in a patient without an underlying 
skull base infection or previous intracranial surgery. Despite optimal surgical 
management, clinical outcomes for mycotic cerebral aneurysms are largely 
dependent on the success of medical therapies at controlling systemic disease.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence and prevalence of juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA) in children ages <16 years in the province of Manitoba, Canada, 
and to determine changes in estimates between 2000 and 2012.
METHODS: JIA cases were ascertained from the administrative health data of 
Manitoba, using a validated case-finding algorithm. Annual incidence and 
prevalence rates were estimated using a generalized linear model with 
generalized estimating equations (GEEs), adjusting for sociodemographic 
characteristics. Changes in estimates were tested using piecewise regression 
models.
RESULTS: A total of 455 cases of JIA prevalence met the inclusion criteria. Sex- 
and age-adjusted incidence estimates were 14.01 (95% confidence interval [95% 
CI] 13.52, 14.53) in 2000/2001 and 9.18 (95% CI 8.56, 9.85) in 2010/2011. 
Prevalence estimates were 65.33 (95% CI 63.87, 66.83) in 2000/2001 and 59.61 
(95% CI 58.17, 61.08) in 2010/2011. A linear piecewise model provided the best 
fit to the data. There was a significant decrease in prevalence over the study 
period (-0.18 [95% CI -0.35, -0.02]; P = 0.0292) but no statistically 
significant change in incidence (-0.46 [95% CI -0.94, 0.01]; P = 0.0571). 
Sex-stratified models revealed a decrease for males in both prevalence (estimate 
-0.54 [95% CI -0.84, -10.25]; P = 0.0003) and incidence (estimate -1.02 [95% CI 
-2.02, -0.04]; P = 0.0439); there were no changes for females.
CONCLUSION: Few population-based longitudinal epidemiologic studies of JIA have 
been conducted. Our findings suggested a decrease in overall JIA prevalence, and 
in incidence and prevalence in men. Further research to validate these findings 
in other cohorts and to explore factors that contribute to this change will 
benefit future health care planning for JIA.

PURPOSE: Interleukin-37 (IL-37), member of the IL-1 family, is a natural 
suppressor of immune and inflammatory responses. Increased serum IL-37 levels 
were observed in several autoimmune diseases, including Graves' disease. To our 
knowledge, no data on Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) are available in the 
literature.
METHODS: Aim of our study was to measure serum IL-37 levels and evaluate their 
relationship, if any, with oxidative stress markers in HT patients. We enrolled 
45 euthyroid HT patients (5 M e 40 F, median age 40 years) and 50 age- and 
sex-matched healthy controls. None was under L-thyroxine therapy. Serum IL-37 
levels were measured by ELISA. Specific serum tests, such as derived reactive 
oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), and biological anti-oxidant potential (BAP) test 
were performed in all subjects to investigate the changes in oxidative balance, 
and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were determined as a specific marker 
of oxidative stress.
RESULTS: IL-37 levels were significantly higher in HT than in controls (median 
475 vs. 268 pg/ml, P = 0.018). In the same patients, serum oxidants (d-ROMs) 
were increased and anti-oxidants (BAP) decreased compared with controls 
(P = 0.011 and < 0.0001, respectively), clearly indicating an enhanced oxidative 
stress. In addition, AGEs levels were higher in HT patients than in controls 
(210 vs. 140 AU/g prot, P < 0.0001) and directly correlated with IL-37 levels 
(P = 0.048). At multivariate analysis, the main independent predictors that 
influenced IL-37 levels were both anti-thyroid antibodies (P = 0.026) and AGEs 
levels (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-37 is up-regulated in HT and may exert a protective role by 
counteracting oxidative stress and inflammation.

Purpose/aim: To evaluate the efficacy of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):cannabidiol 
(CBD) oromucosal spray (Sativex®) as add-on therapy to optimised standard 
antispasticity treatment in patients with moderate to severe multiple sclerosis 
(MS) spasticity.
METHODS: Sativex® as add-on therapy vs. further optimised first-line 
ANTispastics (SAVANT) was a two-phase trial. In Phase A, eligible patients 
received add-on THC:CBD spray for 4 weeks to identify initial responders [≥20% 
improvement from baseline in spasticity 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) 
score]. Following washout, eligible initial responders were randomised to 
receive THC:CBD spray or placebo for 12 weeks (double-blinded, Phase B). 
Optimisation of underlying antispasticity medications was permitted in both 
groups across all study periods.
RESULTS: Of 191 patients who entered Phase A, 106 were randomised in Phase B to 
receive add-on THC:CBD spray (n = 53) or placebo (n = 53). The proportion of 
clinically relevant responders after 12 weeks (≥30% NRS improvement; primary 
efficacy endpoint) was significantly greater with THC:CBD spray than placebo 
(77.4 vs. 32.1%; p < 0.0001). Compared with placebo, THC:CBD spray also 
significantly improved key secondary endpoints: changes in mean spasticity NRS 
(p < 0.0001), mean pain NRS (p = 0.0013), and mean modified Ashworth's scale 
(p = 0.0007) scores from Phase B baseline to week 12. Adverse events, when 
present, were mild/moderate and without new safety concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: Add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray provided better and clinically 
relevant improvement of resistant MS spasticity compared with adjusting 
first-line antispasticity medication alone.

Distinguishing treatable causes for rapidly progressive dementia from those that 
are incurable is vital. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and voltage-gated 
potassium channel complex-associated autoimmune encephalitis (VGKC AE) are 2 
such conditions with disparate outcomes and response to treatment. To determine 
the differences in electroencephalography between CJD and VGKC AE, we performed 
a retrospective review of medical records and examined clinical data, 
neuroimaging, and electroencephalographs performed in patients admitted for 
evaluation for rapidly progressive dementia diagnosed with CJD and VGKC AE at 
the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Bayview Medical Center between January 1, 2007 
and December 31, 2015. More patients in the VGKC AE group had seizures (12/17) 
than those with CJD (3/14; P = .008). Serum sodium levels were lower in those 
with VGKC AE (P = .001). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count was 
higher in VGKC AE (P = .008). CSF protein 14-3-3 (P = .018) was more commonly 
detected in CJD, and tau levels were higher in those with CJD (P < .006). On 
neuroimaging, diffusion restriction in the cortex (P = .001), caudate (P < 
.001), and putamen (P = .001) was more frequent in CJD. Periodic sharp wave 
complexes (P = .001) and generalized suppressed activity (P = .008) were more 
common on initial EEG in CJD. On serial EEGs, generalized periodic discharges (P 
= .004), generalized suppressed activity (P=0.008), and periodic sharp wave 
complexes (P < .001) were detected more in CJD. This study shows that there are 
a number of differentiating features between CJD and VGKC AE, and 
electroencephalography can aid in their diagnoses. Performing serial EEGs better 
delineates these conditions.

OBJECTIVE: Central nervous system pathways involving pain modulation shape the 
pain experience in patients with chronic pain. The aims of this study were to 
understand the mechanisms underlying pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) and to identify brain signals that may serve as imaging markers for 
developing targeted treatments for RA-related pain.
METHODS: Patients with RA and matched control subjects underwent functional 
magnetic resonance imaging, using pulsed arterial spin labeling. The imaging 
conditions included 1) resting state, 2) low-intensity stimulus, and 3) 
high-intensity stimulus. Stimuli consisted of mechanical pressure applied to 
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints with an automated cuff inflator. The 
low-intensity stimulus was inflation to 30 mm Hg. The high-intensity stimulus 
was the amount of pressure required to achieve a pain intensity rating of 40 on 
a 100-point scale for each RA patient, with the same amount of pressure used in 
the matched control.
RESULTS: Among RA patients, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the medial 
frontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increased during both 
low-pressure and high-pressure stimulation. No rCBF changes were observed in 
pain-free controls. Region-of-interest analyses in RA patients showed that 
baseline rCBF in the medial frontal cortex was negatively correlated with the 
pressure required for the high-intensity stimulus and positively correlated with 
pain induced by the low-intensity stimulus. Baseline rCBF was also marginally 
correlated with disease activity). Regional CBF during high pain was positively 
correlated with pain severity and pain interference.
CONCLUSION: In response to clinically relevant joint pain evoked by pressure 
applied to the MCP joint, neural processing in the medial frontal cortex 
increases and is directly associated with clinical pain in patients with RA.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the feasibility and 
effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) with that of 
high-intensity volitional resistance training for improving muscle structure and 
function and physical function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We 
also compared pre-intervention and post-intervention values of myocyte 
characteristics.
METHODS: In this 2-group, single-blind, randomized pilot study, adult patients 
with RA were assigned to 36 sessions of NMES (n = 31 patients) or volitional 
training (n = 28 patients) over 16 weeks. Outcome measures included muscle 
structure and function (quadriceps muscle area, density, and strength), physical 
function (performance-based and patient-reported), feasibility (increased pain, 
increased disease activity, attrition, and adherence), and myocyte 
characteristics (area, proportion of type I or II muscle fibers, and 
intramyocellular lipid content). Analysis of covariance was used to compare 
groups.
RESULTS: The intervention intensity in the NMES group was less than half that in 
the volitional exercise group (31% versus 77% of maximum effort). Both groups 
experienced significant improvements in muscle structure and function (P < 0.001 
to 0.019). Improvements in muscle characteristics and physical function were not 
different between groups. Exercise did not result in serious adverse events or 
increases in pain and disease activity. Attrition was 29% in the NMES group and 
7% in the volitional exercise group.
CONCLUSION: Both NMES and high-intensity volitional resistance training can be 
used as effective approaches to improving muscle structure and function in 
patients with RA. NMES may be a viable alternative for improving muscle function 
in patients in whom high-intensity resistance exercise may not be tolerated or 
is contraindicated, but attrition must be considered when using this approach.

OBJECTIVE: To obtain the perspective of individuals with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) regarding the role of poverty, neighborhood, and chronic 
stress in SLE outcomes.
METHODS: Through annual structured interviews as part of the Lupus Outcomes 
Study, 723 persons with SLE were followed from 2003 to 2015 in order to 
establish the effect of combinations of poverty, persistent poverty, residence 
in an area of concentrated poverty, access to health care, and chronic stress on 
accumulated damage. We obtained a sample of 28 of the 723 individuals on the 
basis of household income, geography, and outcomes in their last interview, and 
administered qualitative interviews to explore their perspectives on the impact 
of these factors on SLE outcomes. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and 
analyzed using a grounded theory approach.
RESULTS: Persons in poverty frequently reported that poverty necessitated a 
choice to deal with food, medical care, and housing insecurity on a daily basis 
and to relegate their management of SLE to occurrences of disease flares. They 
also reported that exposure to crime in their neighborhoods was a stressor that 
triggered worse disease activity. Affluent participants reported that 
neighborhood neither helped nor hindered dealing with SLE, because they relied 
on networks not tied to neighborhoods to deal with SLE.
CONCLUSION: Mitigating poverty and reducing exposure to crime through moving to 
safer neighborhoods are factors identified by individuals with SLE as 
potentially critical in disease outcomes.

PURPOSE: Irisin is a newly identified myokine secreted by skeletal muscle and 
has significant effects on body metabolism. Thyroidal functional state has a 
profound influence on the metabolism of human body. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to investigate the possible changes in serum irisin concentrations 
before and after treatment in hypothyroid subjects.
METHODS: The study included 26 patients with overt hypothyroidism due to 
Hashimoto thyroiditis and 19 healthy subjects. Baseline serum thyroid function 
tests and presence of thyroid autoantibodies and levels of creatine kinase (CK) 
and irisin were measured in both groups. All measurements in the hypothyroid 
group were repeated after euthyroidism was achieved.
RESULTS: Serum irisin levels were significantly lower in the hypothyroid groups 
than the control group (p < 0.001). Negative correlation between irisin and 
thyroid stimulating hormone and CK levels (r = - 0.623, p < 0.001 and 
r = - 0.389, p = 0.008, respectively) and a positive correlation between irisin 
and free thyroxine (fT4) levels (r = 0.570, p < 0.001) was found. Serum CK 
levels decreased significantly after treatment (p < 0.001). Serum irisin levels 
significantly increased (from 57.4 to 99.8 U/L, p < 0.001) when the hypothyroid 
patients were treated to achieve euthyroidism.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providing 
insight that low serum irisin levels significantly increased following treatment 
to euthyroid state in overt hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. 
Larger scale studies are needed to confirm these results and to ensure irisin as 
a possible biomarker of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

BACKGROUND: Long-term medication adherence is problematic among patients with 
chronic medical conditions. To our knowledge, this was the first study to 
examine factors associated with nonadherence among patients with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who discontinue disease-modifying 
treatments against medical advice.
PURPOSE: To examine differences in perceived provider autonomy support between 
disease-modifying treatment-adherent relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
patients and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients who discontinued 
disease-modifying treatments against medical advice.
METHODS: Self-report questionnaires and a neurologic exam were administered to 
demographically matched adherent (n = 50) and nonadherent (n = 79) relapsing- 
remitting multiple sclerosis patients from the Midwest and Northeast USA.
RESULTS: Adherent patients reported greater perceived autonomy support from 
their treatment providers, F(1, 124) = 28.170, p < .001, partial η2 = .185. This 
difference persisted after controlling for current multiple sclerosis healthcare 
provider, education, disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale, 
perceived barriers to adherence, and prevalence of side effects, F(1, 121) = 
9.61, p = .002, partial η2 = .074. Neither depressive symptoms, F(1, 124) = 
1.001, p > .05, partial η2 = .009, nor the occurrence of a major depressive 
episode, χ2(1, N = 129) = .288, p > .05, differed between adherent and 
nonadherent patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater perceived autonomy support from treatment providers may 
increase adherence to disease-modifying treatments among patients who 
discontinue treatment against medical advice. Results may inform interventions 
for patients who discontinue treatment against medical advice.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of new disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for 
remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has considerably transformed the 
landscape of therapeutic opportunities for this chronic disabling disease. 
Unlike injectable drugs, oral DMTs promote patient satisfaction and increase 
therapeutic adherence.
REVIEW: This article reviews the salient features about the mode of action, 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of approved oral DMTs in RRMS, and 
reviews their place in clinical algorithms in the Middle East and North Africa 
(MENA) region. A systematic review was conducted using a comprehensive search of 
MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (period January 1, 
1995-January 31, 2018). Additional searches of the American Academy of Neurology 
and European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis 
abstracts from 2012-2017 were performed, in addition to searches of the Food and 
Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, to obtain relevant 
safety information on these DMTs.
CONCLUSIONS: Four oral DMTs: fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, and 
cladribine have been approved by the regulatory agencies. Based on the number 
needed to treat (NNT), the potential role of these DMTs in the management of 
active and highly active or rapidly evolving RRMS is assessed. Finally, the 
place of the oral DMTs in clinical algorithms in the MENA region is reviewed.

Blood Glucose Among People With Type 1 Diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring of blood glucose helps people with type 1 diabetes 
to maintain glycemic control and reduce the risk of complications. However, 
adherence to blood glucose monitoring is often suboptimal.
PURPOSE: Like many health behaviors, self-monitoring of blood glucose involves 
exerting effort in the present to achieve future benefits. As such, the present 
research explored whether individual differences in time 
perspective-specifically, the extent to which people have a balanced time 
perspective-are associated with the frequency with which people with type 1 
diabetes monitor their blood glucose and, thus, maintain glycemic control.
METHODS: Adults with type 1 diabetes completed measures of time perspective, 
feelings associated with monitoring, attitudes toward monitoring, and trait 
self-control. Objective data regarding the frequency with which participants 
monitored their blood glucose levels and their long-term glycemic control were 
extracted from their medical records.
RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses and tests of indirect effects (N = 
129) indicated that having a more balanced time perspective was associated with 
more frequent monitoring of blood glucose and, as a result, better glycemic 
control. Further analyses (N = 158) also indicated that there was an indirect 
relationship between balanced time perspective and monitoring of blood glucose 
via the feelings that participants associated with monitoring and their 
subsequent attitudes toward monitoring.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to the importance and relevance of time 
perspective for understanding health-related behavior and may help to inform 
interventions designed to promote self-monitoring of blood glucose in people 
with type 1 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory 
disease which can cause significant disability, morbidity, mortality, and 
impaired fertility. It commonly affects women of childbearing age. Managing 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the perinatal period poses challenges. There is 
concern about the teratogenic effects of many traditional disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and an ever-growing list of new therapeutic 
options with limited data in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
AIMS: We aimed to create a standardized approach to pharmacological management 
of RA patients seen in our newly established Rheumatology and Reproductive 
Health Service.
METHODS: We reviewed relevant publications on the use of anti-rheumatic drugs in 
pregnancy. These include recent guidelines from The British Society for 
Rheumatology (BSR) and British Health Professionals in Rheumatology (BHPR) and 
the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).
RESULTS: After considering relevant publications, we developed a Saint Vincent's 
University Hospital/National Maternity Hospital consensus protocol for 
evidence-based medication in pregnancy in RA.
CONCLUSIONS: RA tends to improve during pregnancy and flare postpartum. Several 
anti-rheumatic medication options during pregnancy and breastfeeding are now 
available including anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents. Good disease 
control at all stages of reproduction is important to ensure best outcome for 
both mother and baby.

OBJECTIVE: Different viral exposures have been implicated in the etiology of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Evidence relating to the association between putative 
viral exposures and the development of RA was reviewed.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE-OVID, 
EMBASE-OVID, PUBMED and Cochrane library databases. Articles were included if 
they were case-controls, cross-sectional or cohort studies and were published in 
English. Case-series were included if there was a lack of other study designs.
RESULTS: Of 6724 citations, 48 were included in meta-analysis. Studies had poor 
quality. PBV19 infection was increased in RA compared to controls [N = 12, odds 
ratio (OR) 1.77 (95% CI: 1.11; 2.80) p = 0.02 for PVB19 IgG]. IgG anti-EBNA 
antibodies were not increased in RA (N = 17, p = 0.75), but anti-VCA [N = 18, OR 
1.5 (95% CI: 1.07; 2.10), p = 0.02] and anti-EA antibodies [N = 11, OR 2.74 (95% 
CI: 1.27; 5.94), p = 0.01] were increased in RA. CMV was not associated with RA 
(N = 13, p = 0.42), nor was HBV (N = 5, p = 0.09). HCV was associated with RA in 
7 case-control studies [OR 2.82 (95% CI: 1.35; 5.90), p = 0.006] and one cohort 
study [hazard ratio (HR) 2.03 (95% CI: 1.27, 3.22), p < 0.01]. Persistent 
arthritis was increased after Chikungunya fever [N = 2, OR 90 (95% CI: 15.2, 
134.3), p = 0.047].
CONCLUSIONS: Studies of RA after viral exposures have poor quality. There is a 
risk of RA after Parvo B19, HCV and possibly EBV infection. CMV and HBV 
infections are not associated with RA. CHIKV is associated with the persistent 
inflammatory arthritis.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term effect of B-cell depletion therapy with 
Rituximab (RTX) alone as rescue therapy in primary antiphospholipid syndrome 
(PAPS) patients with severe thrombocytopenia.
METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data from patients who met the following 
inclusion criteria: (a) persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) positivity 
and fulfilled the Sydney criteria for PAPS (b) presented with severe 
thrombocytopenia (platelets <50,000/mm3) (c) were treated with RTX as a rescue 
therapy (d) had at least 1 year of follow-up after B-cells depletion therapy.
RESULTS: This retrospective study included 6 consecutive female PAPS patients 
[median age 49.5 (range 38-66)] who presented with severe thrombocytopenia 
(platelets <50,000/mm3, mean value 31,000 ± 9000/mm3). We observed a full 
response (defined as >150,000 platelets/mm3) after treatment with RTX in 5 out 
of 6 patients (83.3%). Among responders, after a median follow-up of more than 4 
years, we observed a median time free from relapse of 43 months (range 12-97). 
One patient did not respond to the B-cell depletion therapy and was treated with 
a splenectomy 1 month after RTX therapy and platelets levels normalized after 3 
months. No adverse events were reported, no patients developed significant 
infections. Importantly, the patients required no further maintenance therapy 
for the thrombocytopenia.
CONCLUSION: In one of the longest-term observational (median 43 months) studies, 
sustained clinical remission of severe thrombocytopenia without 
immunosuppressive maintenance therapy was obtained by RTX alone in patients with 
PAPS and severe thrombocytopenia intolerant or refractory to conventional 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells characterized by 
immunomodulatory properties and are therefore considered a promising tool for 
the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate 
whether transplantation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) affects the 
autoimmune pathogenesis in MRL/lpr mice.
METHODS: Fifteen 12-week-old MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided into three 
groups: ADSC, cyclophosphamide (CTX), and control groups, with five mice in each 
group. ADSC and control groups were injected with 1 × 106 ADSCs or PBS, 
respectively, via the tail vein, once a week for 8 weeks. The CTX group was 
injected with CTX at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight, once a week for 2 weeks, 
and this was repeated after 2 weeks rest. Proteinuria, anti-double-stranded DNA 
(anti-dsDNA) antibody, and serum creatinine levels were then measured. The 
populations of Th17 and Treg cells in the spleen were detected by flow 
cytometry. All statistical analyses were performed using least square 
difference.
RESULTS: Eight weeks after treatment, the 24 h proteinuria, anti-dsDNA antibody 
levels, and serum creatinine were decreased significantly with transplantation 
of mouse ADSCs. ADSCs markedly reduced the number of TH17 cells, increased Treg 
cells, and improved renal pathology.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that transplantation of ADSCs could 
significantly inhibit autoimmune progression in MRL/lpr mice and the efficacy of 
ADSCs was comparable to that of CTX.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The provision of medical care to young adults with type 1 
diabetes mellitus is challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the 
rates of microvascular complications and their progression among patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus attending a specialist young adult diabetes service in 
Ireland.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 62 (male 56.5%) patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus attending the young adult diabetes service at our institution was 
undertaken. Data was recorded across two time points, clinic registration and at 
5 years following initial contact.
RESULTS: The mean ± SD age at first attendance was 17.4 ± 2.0 years. Mean ± SD 
duration of diabetes was 6.3 ± 3.9 years with most patients treated using 
multiple daily insulin injections (75.8%). diabetic retinopathy rate at first 
attendance was 17.7% and after 5 years was 37.1% (p = 0.003). The majority of 
cases were background retinopathy. The prevalence of diabetic kidney disease was 
6.4% and this remained unchanged at follow-up. Mean ± SD HbA1c improved from 
76.1 ± 22.4 mmol/mol (9.1 ± 4.2%) to 69.1 ± 14.9 mmol/mol (8.5 ± 3.5%), 
p = 0.044. Duration of diabetes was the only clinical variable associated with 
retinopathy risk at 5 years on multiple regression analysis (p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic retinopathy is prevalent in young adults with type 1 
diabetes attending specialist secondary care diabetes services. Duration of 
diabetes was the strongest determinant of retinopathy risk.

OBJECTIVES: In fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (fT1DM), plasma glucose (PG) 
levels are strongly increased, unlike glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels, 
resulting in a sharply increased PG/HbA1C ratio. We investigated the PG/HbA1C 
ratio in fT1DM and tested the accuracy of cutoff points to easily and 
efficiently differentiate fT1DM from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
METHODS: We report 41 cases of fT1DM in which PG/HbA1C ratio was studied as a 
novel clinical parameter to predict fT1DM. Clinical and biochemical 
characteristics were analyzed in 41 fT1DM and 51 DKA patients in China. 
Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to identify PG/HbA1C 
ratio cutoff points to differentiate fT1DM from DKA.
RESULTS: PG/HbA1C ratio was significantly higher in fT1DM patients 
(7.24±2.49mmol/L/%; i.e., 0.88±0.36L/mol) than in DKA patients 
(2.60±0.69mmol/L/%; i.e., 0.06±0.01L/mol) (P<0.001). PG/HbA1C ratio exceeded 
4.2mmol/L/% (i.e., 0.6 l/mol) in 39 of the 41 fT1DM patients (95.1%), versus 
only 1 of the 51 DKA patients (1.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: PG/HbA1C ratio is a simple tool that may be useful to identify DKA 
patients at high risk of fT1DM. PG/HbA1C ratio with a threshold of≥4.2mmol/L/% 
(i.e., 0.6L/mol) can be adopted as a new clinical parameter in predicting fT1DM.

PURPOSE: Although soft tissue balancing is considered important for successful 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it is unclear whether the laxity and balance 
achieved intraoperatively change postoperatively. A recent study demonstrated 
anaesthesia significantly influenced knee joint laxity after TKA; however, there 
has been no comparison of the varus-valgus laxity immediately after TKA and in 
the postoperative period under the same anesthetic conditions. Therefore, 
quantitative stress arthrometric studies were conducted under identical 
conditions to identify changes in coronal ligament laxity after TKA 
spontaneously.
METHODS: A consecutive series of 28 knees with varus of more than 5° in 28 
patients undergoing staged bilateral TKAs was prospectively evaluated. 
Postoperative varus-valgus laxity was measured immediately after surgery, with 
the patient still under spinal anaesthesia; and again at the time of the 
contralateral TKA, again under anaesthesia. The mean time between the first and 
second operations was 9.7 ± 7.3 months.
RESULTS: Mean medial laxity significantly changed from 2.4° ± 1.6° just after 
the first operation under anaesthesia to 3.8° ± 1.4° just after contralateral 
TKA under anaesthesia (p < 0.001), but no significant change occurred in lateral 
laxity (5.6° ± 2.4° just after the first operation and 5.7° ± 2.1° after 
contralateral TKA, n.s.). Significant negative correlations were identified 
between laxity immediately after surgery and the amount of laxity change on both 
the medial (R = - 0.63, p < 0.001) and lateral sides (R = - 0.53, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Spontaneous soft tissue correction occurs after TKA. The findings 
from this study provides a rationale that it is not necessary for surgeons to 
perform the medial soft tissue release until the soft tissue tension is 
equalized on both the medial and lateral sides which has the risk of excessive 
release leading to instability. In situations where the surgeon is confronted 
with a knee that becomes too tight or too loose depending on the insert 
thickness, it is recommended to choose the thicker insert with the understanding 
that the knee will initially have a slightly tighter medial compartment that 
will loosen over time. The results of this study provide technical 
considerations that can help a surgeon achieve adequate postoperative stability.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sleep disturbance and symptoms of depression 
mediate the relationship between pain and cognitive dysfunction (CD) in a sample 
of 115 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: A total of 115 patients with SLE completed questionnaires regarding 
pain, perceived stress, depression, sleep, and CD. Relationships among pain, 
sleep, depression, and CD were assessed using bootstrap mediation models, 
controlling for race/ethnicity, fibromyalgia diagnosis, current corticosteroid 
use, disease activity and damage, and perceived stress.
RESULTS: Mediation analyses indicated that the effect of pain on CD was mediated 
by sleep disturbance (β = 0.30) and depression symptoms (β = 0.33). These 
effects were maintained even after controlling for the aforementioned 
covariates, of which only disease activity (β = 0.20) and stress (β = 0.22) 
remained significantly linked to CD (overall model R2 = 0.53; all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: After controlling for disease activity and perceived stress, the 
relationship between pain and CD was explained by sleep disturbance and 
depression symptoms. Although these relationships need validation in 
longitudinal studies with additional measurement modalities, our findings may 
indicate promising, nonpharmacologic intervention avenues for SLE patients with 
pain and CD. Specifically, cognitive behavioral therapies for depression and 
sleep are known to reduce distress and enhance functioning across various 
psychosocial domains. Given the symptom burden of SLE, interventions that 
maximize potential benefits without the use of additional pharmacologic 
treatments may be of particular utility.

OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX) induction and 
maintenance therapy for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) in a 
single-centre cohort study.
METHODS: All patients with active GPA, not enrolled in trials, who received ⩾1 
RTX infusion(s) for induction were included. At remission, protocolized 
maintenance RTX infusions were given every 6 months for 18 months. Kaplan-Meier 
curves were used to estimate survival rates. Univariable analyses identified 
factors associated with remission failure and relapse, and Cox models retained 
independent predictors of relapse.
RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen adults with relapsing (65%), 
refractory/grumbling (22%) or new-onset (13%) GPA received RTX for induction; 
100 were given ⩾1 RTX maintenance infusion(s) and 90 received 500 mg every 6 
months. Median daily prednisone induction dose was 30 mg; 76% of patients were 
still receiving a median daily prednisone dose of 5 mg at 2 years. Median 
follow-up was 3.6 years. Respective 2-year relapse-free survival and RTX 
retention rates were 85 and 78%. Serious infection and serious adverse event 
rates were 4.9 and 8.1 per 100 patient-years, respectively. Refractory/grumbling 
vs new-onset and/or relapsing GPA (P < 0.01 for each individually; P < 0.001 vs 
the latter two taken together), pachymeningitis (P < 0.05), pure granulomatous 
disease (P < 0.05) or estimated glomerular filtration rate ⩾60 ml/min (P < 0.01) 
were associated with remission failure. Multivariate analyses retained 
refractory/grumbling GPA (P = 0.05), subglottic stenosis (P < 0.005), ENT 
involvement (P = 0.01) and skin involvement (P < 0.0005) as independent 
predictors of relapse.
CONCLUSION: RTX induction and low-dose preemptive maintenance can effectively 
and safely induce sustained remission in GPA in a real-life setting.

BACKGROUND: In anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated 
glomerulonephritis, antigen specificity varies between myeloperoxidase (MPO) and 
proteinase 3 (PR3). This has been reported to vary in relation to age, gender, 
geography and extrarenal manifestations. However, studies are difficult to 
compare as criteria for inclusion vary. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the relationship between ANCA serotype, latitude, ultraviolet (UV) radiation 
levels, age, gender and renal function at diagnosis in a large study with 
uniform inclusion criteria.
METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis were 
identified from regional or nationwide registries in 14 centres in Norway, 
Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Italy and the USA during the period 
2000-13. UV radiation levels for 2000-13 in Europe were obtained from the 
Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.
RESULTS: A total of 1408 patients (45.2% PR3-ANCA) were included in the study. 
In univariable analysis, PR3-ANCA was significantly associated with male gender 
{odds ratio [OR] 2.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.71-2.62]}, younger age [OR 
per year 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.98)] and higher glomerular filtration rate [OR per 
mL/min 1.01 (95% CI 1.01-1.02); P < 0.001] at diagnosis but not with latitude or 
UV radiation. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, latitude and UV 
radiation also became significant, with higher odds for PR3-ANCA positivity at 
northern latitudes/lower UV radiation levels. However, the latitudinal 
difference in MPO:PR3 ratio is smaller than differences previously reported 
concerning microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The ratio between PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA varies in 
glomerulonephritis with respect to age, gender, renal function and geographic 
latitude/UV radiation levels.

BACKGROUND: Although giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a well-known cause of 
transient and permanent vision loss, diplopia as a presenting symptom of this 
condition is uncommon. We compared symptoms and signs of patients presenting 
with diplopia from GCA to those from other causes.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective study comparing the clinical 
characteristics of patients presenting with diplopia from GCA with age-matched 
controls. Demographic information, review of symptoms, ophthalmic examination, 
and laboratory data of biopsy-proven patients with GCA were compared with those 
of age-matched controls presenting with diplopia.
RESULTS: A total of 27 patients presented with diplopia from GCA, 19 with 
constant diplopia, and 8 with transient diplopia. All patients with constant 
diplopia from GCA were matched with 67 control subjects who had diplopia from 
other etiologies. Patients with GCA were more likely to describe other 
accompanying visual symptoms (58% vs 25%, P = 0.008), a greater number of 
systemic GCA symptoms (3.5, GCA vs 0.6, controls, P < 0.001) such as headache 
(94% [17/18] vs 39% [23/67]; P < 0.001), jaw claudication (80% [12/15] vs 0% 
[0/36]; P < 0.001), and scalp tenderness (44% [7/16] vs 7% [3/43]; P < 0.001). 
Ocular ischemic lesions (26% vs 1%, P < 0.001) were also common in patients with 
diplopia from GCA. Inflammatory markers were elevated significantly in patients 
with GCA vs controls (erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 91% [10/11] vs 12% [3/25], 
P < 0.001; C-reactive protein: 89% [8/9] vs 11% [2/19], P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: GCA is a rare but serious cause of diplopia among older adults and 
must be differentiated from other more common benign etiologies. Our study 
suggests that most patients with diplopia from GCA have concerning systemic 
symptoms and/or elevated inflammatory markers that should trigger further 
work-up. Moreover, careful ophthalmoscopic examination should be performed to 
look for presence of ocular ischemic lesions in older patients presenting with 
acute diplopia.

BACKGROUND: Acute optic neuritis (ON) is often the first manifestation of 
multiple sclerosis which is particularly common in Ireland. Despite the specific 
clinical details regarding investigations and management of ON provided by the 
Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), international surveys have shown that 
there are still notable differences in the management of ON between neurologists 
and ophthalmologists.
AIM: To compare the investigation and treatment of acute optic neuritis between 
ophthalmologists and neurologists in Ireland METHOD: A survey consisting of a 
case scenario and questions regarding treatment and investigations of a patient 
with ON was emailed to ophthalmology consultants, trainees and medical 
ophthalmologists registered with the Irish College of Ophthalmologists and to 
neurology consultants and registrars registered with the Irish Institute of 
Clinical Neuroscience.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty recipients responded out of 350 (46%). The majority 
of the neurologists would initiate steroid treatment regardless of the patient's 
vision (75%), treat with 1 g IV methylprednisolone (100%) for 5 days (57%), 
perform an MRI brain and orbits with contrast (92%) and multiple laboratory 
tests (96%). In contrast, the ophthalmologists tended to initiate treatment 
depending on the patient's vision (48%), treat with 1 g IV methylprednisolone 
(97%) for 3 days instead of 5 days (93%), perform MRI brain and orbits with 
contrast (73%) and favour electrophysiology testing (73%) over laboratory 
testing (68%).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, most respondents would follow the ONTT guidelines 
regarding IV methylprednisolone. There was a significant difference in responses 
between the ophthalmologists and neurologists regarding who to treat, duration 
of treatment and appropriate investigations.

OBJECTIVE: The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) 3×3 method analyzes 
the occurrence of benefit and harm simultaneously at the individual patient 
level. We applied this method to 2 recent rheumatoid arthritis (RA) trial data 
sets.
METHODS: The Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) and the 
Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies (RACAT) randomized trial 
outcomes for safety were defined according to OMERACT as having no adverse 
events (AEs), non-serious AEs, and serious AEs. Treatment efficacy was defined 
as good, moderate, or no response. A good treatment response without any AEs was 
labeled an unqualified success, and no treatment response but at least 1 AE was 
considered an unmitigated failure. The association between benefit and harm was 
assessed by chi-square or exact tests, as appropriate.
RESULTS: In TEAR, 612 of 755 patients had response data at 48 weeks: 14% of 
patients experienced unqualified success and 9% had unmitigated failure, with no 
difference between the treatment arms. Treatment response and AE rates were not 
correlated. In RACAT, 309 of 353 patients had response data at 48 weeks: 6% of 
patients experienced unqualified success and 11% had unmitigated failure, with 
no differences between the treatment arms. Response and AE rates were negatively 
correlated. The frequency of AEs and serious AEs increased as response decreased 
(P = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: We found some evidence that clinical response may be reduced by the 
co-occurrence of AEs.

BACKGROUND: Disabilities in daily living and quality of life are key endpoints 
for evaluating the treatment outcome for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Factors 
possibly contributing to good outcome are adherence and health literacy.
METHODS: The survey included a representative nationwide sample of German 
rheumatologists and their patients with RA. The physician questionnaire included 
the disease activity score (DAS28) and medical prescriptions. The patient 
questionnaire included fatigue (EORTC QLQ-FA13), health assessment questionnaire 
(HAQ), quality of life (SF-12), health literacy (HELP), and patients' listings 
of their medications. Adherence was operationalized as follows: patient-reported 
(CQR5), behavioral (concordance between physicians' and patients' listings of 
medications), physician-assessed, and a combined measure of physician rating 
(1 = very adherent, 0 = less adherent) and the match between physicians' 
prescriptions and patients' accounts of their medications (1 = perfect match, 
0 = no perfect match) that yielded three categories of adherence: high, medium, 
and low. Simple and multiple linear regressions (controlling for age, sex, 
smoking, drinking alcohol, and sport) were calculated using adherence and health 
literacy as predictor variables, and disease activity and patient-reported 
outcomes as dependent variables.
RESULTS: 708 pairs of patient and physician questionnaires were analyzed. The 
mean patient age (73% women) was 60 years (SD = 12). Multiple regression 
analyses showed that high adherence was significantly associated with 5/7 
outcome variables and health literacy with 7/7 outcome variables.
CONCLUSION: Adherence and health literacy had weak but consistent effects on 
most outcomes. Thus, enhancing adherence and understanding of medical 
information could improve outcome, which should be investigated in future 
interventional studies.

Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase 1 inhibitor under development for the treatment 
of several inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Upadacitinib was administered in the phase 2 RA trials primarily as twice-daily 
regimens of an immediate-release (IR) formulation. The upadacitinib 
extended-release (ER) formulation was developed to enable once-daily dosing. In 
the present study, upadacitinib pharmacokinetics were characterized after the 
administration of single and multiple once-daily doses of the ER formulation in 
healthy subjects relative to single and multiple twice-daily doses of the IR 
formulation. Increase in upadacitinib exposure was dose-proportional over the 
evaluated 15- to 30-mg ER dose range. Single 15- and 30-mg ER doses provided 
equivalent AUC0-inf compared with single 12- and 24-mg IR doses, respectively. A 
high-fat breakfast increased upadacitinib ER Cmax and AUC0-inf by only 20% and 
17%, respectively, relative to fasting conditions. The median time to peak 
plasma concentrations was 2 to 4 hours for the ER formulation, and steady state 
was achieved by day 4 of once-daily dosing. Doses of 15 and 30 mg once daily 
using the ER formulation provided equivalent AUC0-24 , comparable Cmax and Cmin 
, and a fluctuation index over a 24-hour period at steady state similar to 6 and 
12 mg twice daily, respectively, using the IR formulation. These results 
supported the use of upadacitinib 15- and 30-mg doses of the ER formulation in 
the phase 3 trials in RA.

BACKGROUND: Facial pain response (PR) to various surgical interventions in 
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is much 
less optimal. No large patient series regarding stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) 
has been published.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of MS-related TN treated with SRS.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. A total of 263 patients 
contributed by 9 member tertiary referral Gamma Knife centers (2 in Canada and 7 
in USA) of the International Gamma Knife Research Consortium (IGKRF) constituted 
this study.
RESULTS: The median latency period of PR after SRS was 1 mo. Reasonable pain 
control (Barrow Neurological Institute [BNI] Pain Scores I-IIIb) was achieved in 
232 patients (88.2%). The median maintenance period from SRS was 14.1 months 
(range, 10 days to 10 years). The actuarial reasonable pain control maintenance 
rates at 1 yr, 2 yr, and 4 yr were 54%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. There was a 
correlation between the status of achieving BNI-I and the maintenance of facial 
pain recurrence-free rate. The median recurrence-free rate was 36 mo and 12.2 mo 
in patients achieving BNI-I and BNI > I, respectively (P = .046). Among 210 
patients with known status of post-SRS complications, the new-onset of facial 
numbness (BNI-I or II) after SRS occurred in 21 patients (10%).
CONCLUSION: In this largest series SRS offers a reasonable benefit to risk 
profile for patients who have exhausted medical management. More favorable 
initial response to SRS may predict a long-lasting pain control.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate interleukin 37 (IL-37) 
levels in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA), its expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 
correlation with disease activity and angiogenesis.
METHODS: Seventy JIA patients and 50 control subjects were examined. The 
Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score in 27 joints (JADAS-27) was 
calculated. Immunoassays were used to measure the serum and synovial fluid 
levels of IL-37, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble VEGF 
receptor 1 (sVEGF-R1), and sVEGF-R2. Relative expression of IL-37 mRNA in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the power Doppler ultrasound score of the 
affected joint were measured.
RESULTS: Patients with JIA were subdivided as 20 systemic-onset, 20 
polyarticular, and 30 oligoarticular (10 persistent, 20 extended) cases. Serum 
levels of IL-37, VEGF, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R2 and relative IL-37 mRNA expression 
were significantly higher in JIA patients when compared with the control 
subjects (p < 0.001). These concentrations were significantly higher in 
systemic-onset JIA compared with those in polyarticular and oligoarticular JIA, 
and in polyarticular JIA when compared with oligoarticular JIA (p < 0.001). 
Serum, synovial, and mRNA expression levels of IL-37 were positively correlated 
with C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Juvenile Arthritis 
Disease Activity Score in 27 joints, power Doppler ultrasound score (p < 0.001), 
and the serum and synovial VEGF and VEGF-RI and -R2 levels (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that IL-37 levels and mRNA expression were 
significantly increased in JIA patients, and their levels were positively 
correlated with disease activity and markers of angiogenesis (VEGF and VEGF 
receptors), suggesting that IL-37 may be correlated with angiogenesis.

PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features, treatment and visual outcomes of 
Japanese patients with new-onset acute Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.
METHODS: Clinical records of 111 patients who presented between 1999 and 2015 to 
the Ocular Inflammation Service of the Kyorin Eye Center, Tokyo, were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 111 patients (68 women, 43 men), 16 had complete, 90 had 
incomplete and 5 had probable VKH disease. The median follow-up period was 36 
months (4-175 months). The mean age at presentation was 41 years (19-74 years). 
Serous retinal detachment (202 eyes) and optic disc hyperaemia (89 eyes) were 
observed at presentation. Of the patients tested, 45/48 (93.8%) were 
human leucocyte antigen-DR4 positive and 63/77 (81.8%) had cerebrospinal fluid 
pleocytosis. Initial corticosteroid treatment consisted of pulse intravenous 
therapy in all patients. Sunset glow fundus was observed in 49.5% of eyes, and 
anterior and/or posterior segment recurrence of inflammation was observed in 25 
patients (22.5%). Treatment was transitioned to cyclosporine in 17 patients 
(15.3%) for steroid sparing (6 patients) or recurrent inflammation (11 
patients), with good subsequent control. Ocular complications were observed in 
47 of 222 eyes (21.2%) (mostly cataract), and systemic complications were 
observed in 8.1% of patients (mostly hypertension and diabetes mellitus). 
Ninety-three percent of eyes (167 of 178 eyes) had a visual acuity of ≥1.0 at 
1 year after presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive corticosteroid treatment strategy in a large number 
of patients with new-onset acute VKH disease, with transitioning to cyclosporine 
in selected cases, resulted in excellent visual outcomes and low rates of 
recurrence.

SLE has a complex pathogenesis, and multiple therapeutic targets have been 
discovered in recent years. In spite of belimumab being approved by the US Food 
and Drug Administration and the widespread use of rituximab, there have been 
many failed attempts to treat SLE successfully using biologic agents. In this 
review, we consider newer biologic approaches that might offer the hope of 
improving the outcome of SLE patients. These include the fully humanized 
anti-CD20 mAbs, PEGylated anti-CD40L, IFNα inhibitors, rigerimod and immune 
complexes blockade.

Poor Encoding and Weak Early Consolidation Underlie Memory Acquisition Deficits 
in Multiple Sclerosis: Retroactive Interference, Processing Speed, or Working 
Memory?

OBJECTIVE: Learning and memory impairments are common in multiple sclerosis (MS) 
and may be related to difficulty acquiring (encoding or consolidating) new 
information. We evaluate the role of retroactive interference and investigate 
whether minimizing interference immediately following encoding (early during 
consolidation) will improve MS participants' ability to remember new verbal 
information. Additionally, we investigate processing speed differences between 
memory-impaired and unimpaired participants and present an exploratory analysis 
of how the dual-components of working memory (capacity vs. processing) relate to 
memory impairment.
METHOD: MS memory-unimpaired (N = 12) and MS memory-impaired participants (N = 
12) were compared to healthy controls (N = 15). Interference onset following 
encoding (early, mid, late, no interference) was manipulated over the retention 
interval of a verbal learning and memory task. Response times (RT) were recorded 
during interference trials.
RESULTS: MS memory-impaired participants encoded less information and lost 
proportionally more information over the retention interval (weak 
consolidation). Lengthening the onset of interference did not benefit memory 
performance in this sample. Memory performance was unrelated to RT but was 
related to performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test. Primary capacity of 
working memory did not differ across groups; however, secondary memory 
processing was reduced for MS memory-impaired participants.
CONCLUSION: Minimizing interference following encoding did not improve memory in 
this sample. Both initial encoding and early consolidation were reduced for 
memory-impaired MS participants. Evidence for a relationship between processing 
speed and memory was mixed and depended on the processing speed assessment used. 
Memory impairment in MS may be partially due to inefficient processing within 
working memory.

OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory 
disorder which further doubles the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. 
Some studies suggest that in RA patients, the prevalence of hypertension 
increases due to prednisolone use, clinical status, genetic factors, and 
physical inactivity. On the other hand, dipper and non-dipper status in RA 
patients compared to non-RA subjects has not been investigated to our knowledge. 
Purpose of the study is to investigate whether non-dipper status is more 
deteriorated in RA patients.
METHODS: Sixty-five RA patients and 61 age-sex-matched control patients were 
evaluated in this cross-sectional study. Patients were classified according to 
24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results. Patients with previous 
hypertension diagnosis, coronary artery disease, and abnormal kidney function 
were excluded.
RESULTS: Mean age of the study sample was 53.7 ± 12.3 years and 40.5% were male. 
There was no significant difference between groups in terms of basic demographic 
characteristics. Leukocyte counts (p = 0.001), neutrophil counts (p = 0.001), 
and red cell distribution width (p = 0.000) were significantly higher in the RA 
group. ABPM results indicate no significant difference between RA patients and 
the control group in terms of daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and average systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure results (p > 0.05). There was no statistical difference 
regarding the non-dipper status of patient groups (p = 0.412). Nocturnal blood 
pressure dipping was significantly similar between groups (p = 0.980).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, RA patients have similar values in terms of nocturnal 
blood pressure dipping and hypertension diagnosis as compared to normal 
population.

OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a worldwide epidemic and a growing body of evidence 
suggests that it may affect the body's response to biologic agents. We 
investigated the influence of obesity on the efficacy of different biologic 
agents used to treat inflammatory diseases.
METHODS: Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database were searched using relevant 
MeSH and keyword terms for obesity and bDMARDs. Articles were selected if they 
reported a clinical response in obese subjects relative to other BMI categories. 
Response and remission outcomes were assessed using meta-analysis and all other 
reported outcomes were summarized.
RESULTS: Among the 3850 records retrieved, 24 articles met the inclusion 
criteria, including 10 on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 4 on axial 
spondyloarthritis (axSpA), 4 on Crohn's disease (CD), 4 on psoriasis (Ps) and 2 
on psoriasic arthritis (PsA). Four biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (bDMARDs) - anti-TNF agents, T cell co-stimulation inhibitor (abatacept), 
IL-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab), and B-cell depletion therapy (rituximab) - were 
involved. The meta-analysis showed that the odds to reach a good response or 
achieve remission were lower in obese (BMI>30kg/m2) than non-obese (BMI≤30kg/m2) 
patients who were treated with anti-TNF agents (good responder % in RA: OR 0.34, 
95% CI 0.18-0.64; remission% in RA: OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21-0.59; BASDAI50% in 
axSpA: OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21-0.83), but no significant difference between obese 
and non-obese was found in patients treated with abatacept (good responder % in 
RA: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.42-1.36; remission% in RA: OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65-1.09) and 
tocilizumab (good responder % in RA: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.44-2.63; remission% in 
RA: OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.50-1.66).
CONCLUSION: Obesity hampered the effect of anti-TNF agents, but not those of 
abatacept and tocilizumab, suggesting that a personalized treatment strategy 
should be considered for obese patients with inflammatory diseases.

This study describes the development and psychometric evaluation of an 
adolescent self-report version of the Pediatric Diabetes Routines Questionnaire 
(PDRQ:A), a measure of diabetes-specific routines for youth with type 1 
diabetes, and further validation of the parent-version (PDRQ:P) in an adolescent 
sample. Participants included 120 parent-adolescent dyads (ages 12-17) and an 
additional 24 parents who completed measures of diabetes-specific adolescent 
routines, general adolescent routines, diabetes self-care, and family support of 
youth diabetes care. The PDRQ:P/A demonstrated good internal consistency, 
test-retest reliability, and parent-child agreement, and adequate validity 
coefficients. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a one-factor model. 
Promising results were obtained. The PDRQ:P/A is a clinically feasible parent- 
and self-report measure that can provide valuable information regarding how 
frequently adolescents engage in their diabetes management tasks in a consistent 
manner. Addition of an adolescent report format will enhance the utility of the 
measure for clinical and research use.

Thrombocytopenia presenting during early childhood is most commonly diagnosed as 
immune/idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), where the antibody-mediated 
destruction of thrombocytes is often transient. If treatment is indicated, the 
majority of patients respond to immune-modulation by intravenous immunoglobulin 
G infusion or systemic corticosteroids. Differential diagnoses to childhood ITP 
includes thrombocytopenia due to infections, drugs, rheumatologic conditions, 
immune dysregulation, and inherited bone marrow failures, for example, 
congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. Isolated thrombocytopenia in an 
otherwise healthy appearing child that recurs after therapy and/or persists 
suggest a differential diagnosis rather than ITP. We present a case of 
symptomatic thrombocytopenia in a 2-year-old girl associated with adenosine 
deaminase deficiency.

Buenos Aires, Instituto Universitario Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, and 
Fundacion PM Catoggio, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to compare learned helplessness (LH) and 
perceived self-efficacy (SE) in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and to assess their correlation with functional disability, level 
of perceived pain, and fatigue.
METHODS: This multicenter, cross-sectional study included consecutive patients 
(aged ≥18 years) with RA, according to the 2010 American College of 
Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria, and FM, according to 
2010 American College of Rheumatology criteria. Learned helplessness was 
measured by the Rheumatology Attitude Index, Spanish version; SE with the 
Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale, Spanish version; functional capacity with the 
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Argentine version; depression with Center 
for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale 7-item version and perceived pain 
and fatigue by the visual analog scale. Disease activity was measured by the 
Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and disease impact with the Fibromyalgia 
Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).
RESULTS: A total of 215 patients, 100 with FM and 115 with RA, were included. 
Mean age was 59 (SD, 14) years and 58 (SD, 13) years for FM and RA, patients 
respectively. Whereas LH and depression were significantly higher, SE was 
significantly lower in FM patients. We found a positive correlation between LH 
and HAQ, pain, depression, fatigue, FIQ, and CDAI in FM and RA patients. We 
observed a negative correlation between SE and HAQ, pain, depression, fatigue, 
FIQ (FM), and CDAI (RA) in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Both LH and SE correlate significantly with functional capacity, 
perceived pain, disease activity, and disease impact in RA and FM patients. 
Learned helplessness was higher in patients with active disease or high disease 
impact, as opposed to those in remission or with low disease impact, and the 
reverse was true for SE. Patients with FM had significantly more LH, pain, 
fatigue, and depression and less SE compared with those with RA.

BACKGROUND: Suppurative cervical lymphadenitis is rare in children with limited 
information about the frequency of neutropenia in any series.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients in whom 
suppurative cervical lymphadenitis was diagnosed between April 2011 and March 
2016 at a tertiary children's hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Microbiologically 
confirmed cases of cervical lymphadenitis with abscess formation were included 
in the analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (median age, 1 yr old; 64% female) with abscess 
formation caused by Staphylococcus aureus were identified. Among these 25 
patients, 5 (20%) met the criteria for chronic neutropenia and 4 (80%) received 
the final diagnosis of autoimmune neutropenia based on the identification of the 
serum anti-CD16 antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic neutropenia and autoimmune neutropenia were relatively 
common among infants with suppurative cervical lymphadenitis caused by S. 
aureus.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the long-term (52 weeks) safety and effectiveness of 
iguratimod (IGU) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, observational study included all 
evaluable RA patients who received IGU since its market launch in 2012. We 
evaluated adverse events (AEs); adverse drug reactions (ADRs); ADRs of special 
interest, including liver and renal dysfunctions, interstitial lung disease, 
gastrointestinal and blood disorders, and infection; and change in Disease 
Activity Score 28-C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) at week 52.
RESULTS: Safety and effectiveness were analyzed in 2666 and 1614 patients, 
respectively. The incidences of AEs, serious AEs, ADRs, and serious ADRs were 
46.92, 7.35, 38.26, and 4.58%, respectively. The incidence of ADRs peaked at 
approximately 4 weeks of treatment. Subsequently, the ADR incidence did not 
increase over time. Improvement of RA activity was shown up to week 52.
CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with IGU in patients with RA resulted in a 
tolerable safety profile and an improvement in RA activity. IGU could be 
considered a useful treatment option for patients with RA.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder that typically affects young 
people during their most productive years, causing irreversible damage and 
accumulation of disability. Treatments over time have had modest effects at 
completely controlling or suppressing disease activity, but are generally aimed 
at controlling early dominating inflammation that, over time, accumulates damage 
and leads to progressive disability. Some unfortunate patients are destined to 
deteriorate despite even newer and more effective agents because of the 
inability of these drugs to fully curb the inflammatory component of the 
disease. These patients require something more that might be capable of halting 
the disease process. Using high-intensity myeloablative chemotherapeutic agents, 
it is now possible to completely remove the peripheral immune system and replace 
it anew from autologous bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, purged of 
disease-causing MS cells. This procedure, referred to as hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT), produces a new immune system that appears tolerant and 
no longer attacks the central nervous system (CNS).

OBJECTIVE: Constrictive bronchiolitis (CB) is a poorly understood pulmonary 
manifestation of primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS). We aimed to clarify the 
presenting clinicoradiologic features and clinical course of pSS-associated CB 
through a retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 11 patients with pSS and CB (defined by 
mosaic pattern with air trapping on computed tomography) encountered at our 
institution over 9 years from 2007 to 2015. Presenting clinical features, 
laboratory results, radiologic findings, and clinical course were analyzed.
RESULTS: Our patients were mostly women (91%), with a median age 53 years 
(range, 31-76 years) at the time of pulmonary symptom (dyspnea or cough) onset. 
Most (64%) were nonsmokers. Average interval between diagnosis of pSS and the 
onset of pulmonary symptoms was 4.4 years; in 4 patients (36%), CB was the 
presenting manifestation of pSS. Chest radiographs were normal (67%) or 
demonstrated hyperinflation (33%). Pulmonary function testing demonstrated 
airflow obstruction in 7 patients (63%), and 2 patients (18%) had an isolated 
reduction in diffusing capacity, whereas the remaining 2 patients manifested 
mixed physiology or normal results. Surgical lung biopsy was performed in 2 
patients and confirmed the diagnosis of CB in both. Treatment was variable among 
our patients included glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate 
mofetil, and cyclophosphamide. Among 6 patients with follow-up computed 
tomography and pulmonary function, the results remained stable or worsened.
CONCLUSIONS: Constrictive bronchiolitis is a rare extraglandular manifestation 
and can sometimes be the presenting manifestation of pSS. This pulmonary 
manifestation is associated with an indolent clinical course and does not 
respond well to immunosuppressive therapy.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to identify risk factors for 
hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) to tocilizumab (TCZ) in systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (sJIA).
METHODS: Clinical records of 40 patients with sJIA administered TCZ at one 
center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into HSR or non-HSR 
groups depending on the presence of HSR between the first and third TCZ 
administrations; clinical and laboratory assessments, including serum cytokine 
profile, were compared.
RESULTS: Five patients displayed HSR following the third TCZ administration. 
They were significantly younger, shorter, and lighter, with a higher peak body 
temperature than non-HSR patients following the third administration. Their 
serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was undetectable following the first 
administration but detectable by the third administration. Before the third 
administration, the white blood cell counts and serum levels of CRP and sTNFRII 
were significantly higher in the HSR group than in the non-HSR group. The serum 
levels of interleukin-18 and -6 before the third TCZ administration were higher 
and lower than those before the first administration in the HSR and non-HSR 
groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Patients with sJIA having a younger age, shorter stature, and 
lighter weight and those showing increased disease activity in the early period 
of TCZ administration may be at higher risk of TCZ-induced HSR.

OBJECTIVES: To clarify systemic effects of orthopedic surgical intervention in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was performed in RA patients 
who were scheduled to have primary elective orthopedic surgeries. Assessments 
were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months after surgery using J-HAQ, General 
Health, EQ-5D, BDI-II, DAS28-CRP(4) and CRP for all registered patients, DASH 
and grip power for patients with upper-extremity surgeries, TUG for patients 
with lower-extremity surgeries, and JSSF for patients with ankle and forefoot 
surgeries.
RESULTS: There were 294 sites in 276 patients whose average age was 64 (19-89) 
years and average disease duration was 16 (1-60) years. Surgical site was 
shoulder in six patients, elbow in 26, wrist in 74, hand in 63, hip in 13, knee 
in 50, ankle in 12, and forefoot in 50. In total, physical function (J-HAQ, grip 
power, DASH, TUG, JSSF), quality of life (J-HAQ, General Health, EQ-5D) and 
depression (BDI-II) improved and disease activity (CRP, DAS28-CRP(4)) decreased 
significantly 6 and 12 months after surgery (p<.01), despite some differences in 
their outcomes by the preoperative disease activity and the surgical site.
CONCLUSION: Overall benefits were provided by orthopedic surgical intervention 
generally in patients with RA.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the distribution of 25-question Geriatric Locomotive 
Function Scale (GLFS-25) scores in Japanese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 
and evaluate relationships with clinical variables.
METHODS: Among 15,115 patients registered in the NinJa database for fiscal year 
2015, 1710 with complete GLFS-25 and disease activity score-28 (DAS28) data were 
analyzed. Correlations between GLFS-25 score and clinical variables were 
assessed by Spearman coefficients. Mean GLFS-25 scores were compared among DAS28 
groups (<2.6, 2.6-3.1, 3.2-5.0, ≥5.1) using the Kruskal-Wallis test. To evaluate 
the performance of the GLFS-25 and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability 
Index (HAQ-DI) for predicting DAS28 ≥ 3.2 (moderate/high disease activity), 
receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed.
RESULTS: GLFS-25 score was significantly correlated with age, disease duration, 
DAS28, and HAQ-DI. GLFS-25 score increased in parallel with DAS28. The 
proportion of patients with locomotive syndrome stage 2 also increased with 
DAS28. Area under the curve values for HAQ-DI and GLFS-25 score were 0.739 and 
0.768, respectively. At a GLFS-25 positive cutoff score ≥16, sensitivity was 
0.716 and specificity was 0.661 for predicting DAS28 ≥ 3.2.
CONCLUSION: This study documents the GLFS-25 score distribution in Japanese RA 
patients and demonstrates that GLFS-25 is a useful measure for evaluating 
functional ability in RA.

There are four neurological complications that can occur after malaria treatment 
at a time when the patient is aparasitaemic: delayed cerebellar ataxia, acute 
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, post-malaria neurological syndrome 
and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). The authors describe a case of 
a 54-year-old male who presented with encephalopathy and generalized seizures 
forty-three days after complete recovery from acute malaria by Plasmodium 
falciparum. Diagnosis of post-malaria ADEM was made based on the acute onset of 
the neurological symptoms, characteristic findings in magnetic resonance imaging 
of the brain and prompt response to steroid therapy. ADEM is an autoimmune 
demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that usually arises after an 
infection or vaccination. Its occurrence after malaria infection is relatively 
rare, and to the best of our knowledge there are only thirteen cases described 
in the literature.

C1s deficiency is strongly associated with the development of human systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, the mechanisms by which C1s deficiency 
contributes to the development of SLE have not yet been elucidated in detail. 
Using ICR-derived-glomerulonephritis (ICGN) mouse strain that develops SLE and 
very weakly expresses C1s in the liver, we investigated the protective roles of 
C1s against SLE. A genetic sequence analysis revealed complete deletion of the 
C1s1 gene, a mouse homolog of the human C1s gene, with partial deletion of the 
C1ra and C1rb genes in the ICGN strain. This deletion led to the absence of 
C1r/C1s and a low level of C1q in the circulation. In order to investigate 
whether the C1r/C1s deficiency induces SLE, we produced a congenic mouse strain 
by introducing the deletion region of ICGN into the C57BL/6 strain. Congenic 
mice exhibited no C1r/C1s and a low level of C1q in the circulation, but did not 
have any autoimmune defects. These results suggest that C1r/C1s deficiency is 
not sufficient to drive murine SLE and also that other predisposing genes exist 
in ICGN mice.

In clinical trials, a placebo response refers to improvement in disease symptoms 
arising from the psychological effect of receiving a treatment rather than the 
actual treatment under investigation. Previous research has reported genomic 
variation associated with the likelihood of observing a placebo response, but 
these studies have been limited in scope and have not been validated. Here, we 
analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 784 patients undergoing placebo 
treatment in Phase III Asthma or Rheumatoid Arthritis trials to assess the 
impact of previously reported variation on patient outcomes in the placebo arms 
and to identify novel variants associated with the placebo response. Contrary to 
expectations based on previous reports, we did not observe any statistically 
significant associations between genomic variants and placebo treatment outcome. 
Our findings suggest that the biological origin of the placebo response is 
complex and likely to be variable between disease areas.

    Rheumatology (Oxford). 2019 Feb 1;58(2):187-188.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this national study in Sweden of patients with RA were 
to: examine the prevalence of sustained remission (SR), that is, remission 
lasting for at least 6 months; compare the prevalence of SR in patients with 
early RA and established RA; study the timing of onset of and time spent in SR; 
and study possible predictors of SR.
METHODS: Adult patients with RA included in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality 
registry were studied. The registry was searched for patients fulfilling 
remission criteria: DAS28-ESR, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), 
Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and ACR/EULAR remission for at least 6 
months. Early RA was defined as symptom duration ⩽6 months at inclusion in the 
Swedish Rheumatology Quality.
RESULTS: Of 29 084 patients, 12 193 (41.9%) reached DAS28 SR at some time point 
during follow-up compared with 6445 (22.2%), 6199 (21.3%) and 5087 (17.5%) for 
CDAI, SDAI and ACR/EULAR SR, respectively. SR was more common in early RA (P < 
0.001). The median time from symptom onset to SR was 1.9, 2.4, 2.4 and 2.5 years 
according to DAS28, CDAI, SDAI and ACR/EULAR criteria, respectively. Lower age, 
male sex and milder disease characteristics were associated with SR.
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients in this nationwide study never reached SR. 
Patients with early RA are more likely to reach SR than patients with 
established RA.

Genetic polymorphism (rs1800693) of TNFRSF1A (type 1 tumour necrosis factor 
receptor) encodes a potentially anti-inflammatory soluble truncated form of the 
p55 receptor, which is associated with predisposition to multiple sclerosis but 
protection against ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We analysed 2917 UK Caucasian 
cases by linear and logistic regression for associations of rs1800693 with 
disease severity assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis measures of disease 
activity and function (BASDAI, BAS-G and BASFI) and/or responses to anti-TNF 
therapy. In contrast to predictions, rs1800693 GG homozygotes actually had 
significantly worse BASDAI (mean 4.2, 95% CI: 4-4.5) than AA homozygotes (mean 
3.8, 95% CI: 3.7-4) in both the unadjusted (difference = 0.4, p = 0.006) and 
adjusted analyses (difference = 0.2-0.5, p = 0.002-0.04 depending on the 
adjustment model). We found no evidence that rs1900693 predicted functional 
status (BASFI) or global disease scores (BAS-G), and it exerted no influence on 
either the intention to treat with or efficacy of anti-TNF treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sirukumab, a human 
anti-interleukin six monoclonal antibody, in Japanese patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis who were refractory to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.
METHODS: This subgroup analysis, based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
52-week phase 3, global study (SIRROUND-T) assessed the American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 16 (primary endpoint). Secondary 
endpoints: ACR 50, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints-C reactive protein, 
Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index and safety were assessed. 
Results 116/878 patients received sirukumab 50 mg/4 weeks (q4w, n = 35), 
100 mg/2 weeks (q2w, n = 44) or placebo (n = 37) subcutaneously. Significantly 
more patients achieved ACR 20 response at week 16 with sirukumab (50 mg q4w:20 
[57.1%]; p < .001, 100 mg q2w:24 [54.5%]; p = .001) versus placebo (7 [18.9%]); 
consistent significant improvement in secondary endpoints at week 24 and 52 was 
observed. At week 24, incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 
numerically higher with sirukumab groups (50 mg q4w:29 [82.9%]; 100 mg q2w:38 
[86.4%] versus placebo (28 [75.7%]); however, at week 52, sirukumab combined 
groups had comparable incidence of TEAEs.
CONCLUSION: Efficacy findings through 52 weeks were comparable between sirukumab 
doses in Japanese patients and consistent with primary SIRROUND-T study results. 
No new safety signals were observed.

INTRODUCTION: Immune Mediated Inner Ear Disease (IMIED) is a rare form of 
sensorineural bilateral hearing loss, usually progressing in weeks to months and 
responsive to immunosuppressive treatment. Despite recent advances, there is no 
consensus on diagnosis and optimal treatment.
METHODS: A review of articles on IMIED from the last 10 years was conducted 
using PubMed® database.
RESULTS: IMIED is a rare disease, mostly affecting middle aged women. It may be 
a primary ear disease or secondary to autoimmune systemic disease. A dual immune 
response (both cellular and humoral) seems to be involved. Cochlin may be the 
inner ear protein targeted in this disease. Distinction from other (core common) 
forms of neurosensory hearing loss is a challenge. Physical examination is 
mandatory for exclusion of other causes of hearing loss; audiometry identifies 
characteristic hearing curves. Laboratory and imaging studies are controversial 
since no diagnostic marker is available.
CONCLUSION: Despite recent research, IMIED diagnosis remains exclusive. Steroids 
are the mainstay treatment; other therapies need further investigation. For 
refractory cases, cochlear implantation is an option and with good relative 
outcome.

Due to the paucity of evidence, this study was conducted to evaluate: (1) unique 
characteristics of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and (2) short-term clinical 
outcomes, of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with MS (MS-TKA) 
compared with matched non-MS patients. MS patients who underwent TKA were 
identified using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. The study 
sample consisted of 10,884 patients with MS and 56,45,227 control cohort. 
Various patient factors were compared. To control for potential confounders, 
with the use of propensity scores, MS-TKA patients were matched (1:3) to 
non-MS-TKA patients and regression analyses were performed to compare 
perioperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and discharge dispositions. 
Patients with MS were younger, more likely to be females, on corticosteroids, 
and more likely to have muscle spasms and gait abnormalities. Annual frequency 
of TKAs in MS patients increased from 1.16/1,000 TKAs in 2002 to 2.48/1,000 TKAs 
in 2013 (p < 0.001). Compared with the matched cohort, MS patients had 
significantly greater odds for any medical complication (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.44), longer mean LOS (mean difference: 
0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.22), and had a greater chance of being discharged to a care 
facility (OR = 2.17; 95% CI, 1.96-2.40). In this study, we identified specific 
characteristics of patients with MS who had TKA and analyzed and compared their 
short-term TKA outcomes to non-MS patients. It was demonstrated that more 
patients with MS are undergoing TKA, and these patients were at a higher risk of 
perioperative complications, had longer LOS, and were more likely to be 
discharged to a sub-acute or inpatient facility. Orthopaedic surgeons should be 
cognizant of the increased risks and provide proper counseling to MS patients 
who are candidates for TKA.

BACKGROUND: Serological activity may precede clinical flares of lupus nephritis 
(LN) but the management of asymptomatic serological reactivation (ASR) remains 
undefined.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 138 episodes of ASR, which 
included 53 episodes in which immunosuppression was increased preemptively and 
85 episodes in which treatment was unaltered. Preemptive immunosuppressive 
treatment comprised increasing the dose of prednisolone to ∼0.5 mg/kg/day, and 
in patients already on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine (AZA), 
increasing the dose to 1.5 g/day and 100 mg/day, respectively.
RESULTS: Thirty-four episodes of renal flare occurred during follow-up 
(88.8 ± 77.3 and 82.8 ± 89.7 months in the preemptive group and controls, 
respectively), following 5 (9.4%) of preemptively treated ASR and 27 (31.8%) of 
untreated ASR [hazard ratio 0.3 (confidence interval 0.1-0.7), P = 0.012]. 
Preemptive treatment was associated with superior survival free of renal relapse 
(99, 92 and 90% at 6, 12 and 24 month, respectively, compared with 94, 69 and 
64% in controls; P = 0.011), whereas survival rate free of extrarenal relapse 
was similar in the two groups. Preemptively treated patients who did not develop 
renal flares showed better renal function preservation (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate slope +0.54 ± 0.43 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, compared with 
-2.11 ± 0.50 and -1.00 ± 0.33 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, respectively, in controls who 
did and did not develop subsequent renal flares; P = 0.001 and 0.012, 
respectively). Preemptive treatment was associated with an increased incidence 
of gastrointestinal side effects attributed to MMF (P = 0.031), whereas 
infection rate did not differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: A preemptive moderate increase of immunosuppression for ASR in LN 
patients may reduce renal flares and confer benefit to long-term renal function.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of renal involvement in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic 
autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is of major clinical importance 
to allow prompt initiation of treatment and limit renal damage. Urinary soluble 
cluster of differentiation 163 (usCD163) has recently been identified as a 
potential biomarker for active renal vasculitis. However, a significant number 
of patients with active renal vasculitis test negative using usCD163. We 
therefore studied whether soluble CD25 (sCD25), a T cell activation marker, 
could improve the detection of renal flares in AAV.
METHODS: sCD25 and sCD163 levels in serum and urine were measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 72 patients with active renal AAV, 20 with 
active extrarenal disease, 62 patients in remission and 18 healthy controls. 
Urinary and blood CD4+ T and CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cell counts were 
measured in 22 patients with active renal vasculitis. Receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) curves were generated and recursive partitioning was used 
to calculate whether usCD25 and serum soluble CD25 (ssCD25) add utility to 
usCD163.
RESULTS: usCD25, ssCD25 and usCD163 levels were significantly higher during 
active renal disease and significantly decreased after induction of remission. A 
combination of usCD25, usCD163 and ssCD25 outperformed all individual markers 
(sensitivity 84.7%, specificity 95.1%). Patients positive for sCD25 but negative 
for usCD163 (n = 10) had significantly higher C-reactive protein levels and 
significantly lower serum creatinine and proteinuria levels compared with the 
usCD163-positive patients. usCD25 correlated positively with urinary CD4+ T and 
CD4+ TEM cell numbers, whereas ssCD25 correlated negatively with circulating 
CD4+ T and CD4+ TEM cells.
CONCLUSION: Measurement of usCD25 and ssCD25 complements usCD163 in the 
detection of active renal vasculitis.

A recent meta-analysis revealed the contribution of the SIGLEC6 locus to the 
risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, no specific 
Siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) genes (Siglecs) have 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. Here, we performed in silico 
analysis of the function of three major protective alleles in the locus and 
found that these alleles were expression quantitative trait loci that enhanced 
expression of the adjacent SIGLEC12 gene. These data suggest that SIGLEC12 may 
protect against the development of SLE in Asian populations. Consistent with 
human genetic data, we identified two missense mutations in lupus-prone 
B6.NZMSle1/Sle2/Sle3 (Sle1-3) mice in Siglece, which is the murine Siglec with 
the greatest homology to human SIGLEC12. Since the mutations resulted in reduced 
binding of Siglec E to splenic cells, we evaluated whether Siglece-/- mice had 
SLE phenotypes. We found that Siglece-/- mice showed increased autoantibody 
production, glomerular immune complex deposition and severe renal pathology 
reminiscent of human SLE nephropathy. Our data demonstrate that the Siglec genes 
confer resistance to SLE in mice and humans.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disease with a 
complex clinical course characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and axonal 
degeneration. Diagnosis of MS most commonly includes finding lesions in at least 
two separate areas of the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain, 
spinal cord, and optic nerves. In recent years, there has been a remarkable 
increase in the number of available treatments for MS. An optimal treatment is 
usually based on a personalized approach determined by an individual patient's 
prognosis and treatment risks. Biomarkers that can predict disability 
progression, monitor ongoing disease activity, and assess treatment response are 
integral in making important decisions regarding MS treatment. This review 
describes MS biomarkers that are currently being used in clinical practice; it 
also reviews and consolidates published findings from clinically relevant 
potential MS biomarkers in recent years. The work also discusses the challenges 
of validating and application of biomarkers in MS clinical practice.

Genetic variants near the tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 3 gene 
(TNFAIP3) at the chromosomal region 6q23 demonstrated significant associations 
with multiple autoimmune diseases. The signals of associations have been 
explained to the TNFAIP3 gene, the most likely causal gene. In this study, we 
employed CRISPR/cas9 genome-editing tool to generate cell lines with deletions 
including a candidate causal variant, rs6927172, at 140 kb upstream of the 
TNFAIP3 gene. Interestingly, we observed alterations of multiple genes including 
IL-20RA encoding a subunit of the receptor for interleukin 20. Using 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), Western blotting, and chromatin 
conformation capture we characterized the molecular mechanism that the DNA 
element carrying the variant rs6927172 influences expression of IL-20RA and 
TNFAIP3 genes. Additionally, we developed a new use of the transcription 
activator-like effector (TALE) to study the role of the variant in regulating 
expressions of its target genes. In summary, we generated deletion knockouts 
that included the candidate causal variant rs6927172 in HEK293T cells provided 
new evidence and mechanism for IL-20RA gene as a risk factor for multiple 
autoimmune diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Cognitive fatigue (CF) can be defined as decreased performance with 
sustained cognitive effort. The present study examined the interrelatedness of 
disease severity, fatigue, depression, and sleep quality in order to evaluate 
their predictive roles of CF in MS. Four theoretical models examining these 
variables were assessed.
METHODS: Fifty-eight individuals with a diagnosis of MS were recruited. CF was 
measured by examining last third versus first third performance on the Paced 
Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). The PASAT and self-report measures of 
fatigue, depression, and sleep quality were administered. Path analysis was used 
to evaluate each of the models.
RESULTS: CF was correlated only with depression (r = .362, p = .006) and sleep 
quality (r = .433, p = .001). Sleep quality was the greatest significant 
independent predictor of CF (β = .433, t(1,55) = 3.53, p < .001), accounting for 
17.3% of the total variance. The best fitting model showed sleep quality as the 
largest contributor to CF; however, depression played a smaller predictive role. 
Furthermore, depression emerged as the strongest predictor of sleep quality and 
fatigue. Disease severity weakly predicted depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep quality is the most significant predictor of CF in MS. As 
such, sleep quality may be a treatable cause of CF. Sleep quality itself, 
however, accounted for only 17.3% of the variance in CF suggesting that other 
variables which were not formally assessed in this sample (e.g., anxiety, etc.) 
may also play a predictive role. Follow-up studies should evaluate how results 
may differ with a larger sample size.

Plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pDC) are a specialized DC population with a 
great potential to produce large amounts of type I interferon (IFN). pDC are 
involved in the initiation of antiviral immune responses through their 
interaction with innate and adaptive immune cell populations. In a 
context-dependent manner, pDC activation can induce their differentiation into 
mature DC able to induce both T cell activation or tolerance. In this review, we 
described pDC functions during immune responses and their implication in the 
clearance or pathogenicity of human diseases during infection, autoimmunity, 
allergy and cancer. We discuss recent advances in the field of pDC biology and 
their implication for future studies.

Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a synthetic amino acid copolymer that is approved for 
treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and clinically 
isolated syndrome (CIS). GA reduces multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and 
has shown comparable efficacy with high-dose interferon-β. The mechanism of 
action (MOA) of GA has long been an enigma. Originally, it was recognized that 
GA treatment promoted expansion of GA-reactive T-helper 2 and regulatory T 
cells, and induced the release of neurotrophic factors. However, GA treatment 
influences both innate and adaptive immune compartments, and it is now 
recognized that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are the initial cellular targets 
for GA. The anti-inflammatory (M2) APCs induced following treatment with GA are 
responsible for the induction of anti-inflammatory T cells that contribute to 
its therapeutic benefit. Here, we review studies that have shaped our current 
understanding of the MOA of GA.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant status of 
plasma vitamin E and plasma and intracellular coenzyme Q10 in children with type 
1 diabetes.
METHOD: This case-control study was conducted on 72 children with type 1 
diabetes and compared to 48 healthy children, who were age, sex, and 
ethnicity-matched. The diabetic children were divided according to their 
glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c %) into two groups: poor and good glycemic control 
groups. All children underwent full history taking, clinical examination, and 
laboratory measurement of complete blood count, A1c %, plasma cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and vitamin E levels and coenzyme Q10 levels in plasma, 
erythrocytes, and platelets.
RESULTS: Children with poor glycemic control showed significantly higher plasma 
vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, waist 
circumference/height ratio, cholesterol levels, and lower high-density 
lipoproteins and platelet coenzyme Q10 redox status in comparison to those with 
good glycemic control and the control group (p<0.05). Plasma coenzyme Q10 showed 
a positive correlation with the duration of type 1 diabetes, triglycerides, 
cholesterol, vitamin E, and A1c %, and negative correlation with the age of the 
diabetic group (p<0.05). The platelet redox status showed a negative correlation 
with the A1c % levels (r=-0.31; p=0.022) and the duration of type 1 diabetes 
(r=-0.35, p=0.012).
CONCLUSION: Patients with type 1 diabetes, especially poorly controlled, had 
elevation of plasma vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 levels and decreased platelet 
redox status of coenzyme Q10, which may be an indicator of increased oxidative 
stress.

BACKGROUND: Despite impressive results of the pharmacological management of 
rheumatoid arthritis, still certain patients suffer from rheumatoid forefoot 
problems. Surgical treatment of these forefoot deformities can be an option. In 
literature no high-quality studies on this topic can be found. The goal of 
present study is to compare the results of a metatarsal head (MTH) resecting 
technique with a MTH preserving technique in the operative treatment of severe 
rheumatoid forefoot deformity.
METHODS: Patients suffering from well-defined rheumatoid forefoot deformity were 
prospectively enrolled in three institutions. This non-blinded study had a 
randomised clinical design and eligible patients were randomly assigned to 
undergo either resection of preservation of the MTH. The primary outcome measure 
consisted of the AOFAS score. Secondary outcome measures were: the FFI, the VAS 
for pain and the SF-36.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (10 in MTH preservation group) were included and 
analysed. After one year follow-up no significant differences in AOFAS score and 
additional outcome factors were found. A total of 10 complications in 23 
patients were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This randomised clinical study did not show significant clinical 
difference between a MTH resecting and a preserving procedure in patients 
suffering from rheumatoid forefoot deformity. Both procedures resulted in 
considerable improvement of pain and activity scores.

The effect of "prophylactic" environmental stimulation on clinical symptoms and 
presynaptic defects in mice suffering from the experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute stage of disease (21 ± 1 days post 
immunization, d.p.i.) was investigated. In EAE mice raised in an enriched 
environment (EE), the clinical score was reduced when compared to EAE mice 
raised in standard environment (SE).Concomitantly, gain of weight and increased 
spontaneous motor activity and curiosity were observed, suggesting increased 
well-being in mice. Impaired glutamate exocytosis and cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) production in cortical terminals of SE-EAE mice were 
evident at 21 ± 1 d.p.i.. Differently, the 12 mM KCl-evoked glutamate exocytosis 
from cortical synaptosomes of EE-EAE mice was comparable to that observed in SE 
and EE-control mice, but significantly higher than that in SE-EAE mice. 
Similarly, the 12 mM KCl-evoked cAMP production in EE-EAE mice cortical 
synaptosomes recovered to the level observed in SE and EE-control mice. MUNC-18 
and SNAP25 contents, but not Syntaxin-1a and Synaptotagmin 1 levels, were 
increased in cortical synaptosomes from EE-EAE mice when compared to SE-EAE 
mice. Circulating IL-1β was increased in the spinal cord, but not in the cortex, 
of SE-EAE mice, and it did not recover in EE-EAE mice. Inflammatory infiltrates 
were reduced in the cortex but not in the spinal cord of EE-EAE mice. 
Demyelination was observed in the spinal cord; EE significantly diminished it. 
We conclude that "prophylactic" EE is beneficial to synaptic derangements and 
preserves glutamate transmission in the cortex of EAE mice. This article is part

PURPOSE: To analyze the change in refractive error and the axial length of 
chronic Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.
METHODS: Medical records of 106 eyes of 54 adult VKH patients were analyzed. The 
refractive error and the axial length were compared between the baseline 
(defined as the time point at least 2 weeks after acute stage of VKH) and the 
final visit. The rate of the eyes with significant myopia progression [defined 
as refraction change toward myopia > 1 diopter (D)] was examined. The 
correlation of the degree of sunset glow fundus/choroidal thickness with the 
change in refractive error was also evaluated.
RESULTS: At the final visit, the mean refractive error was more myopic and the 
axial length was longer than at baseline. Seventeen of the 106 eyes (16.0%) 
showed significant myopia progression. The mean change in refractive error 
during a follow-up in these 17 eyes was - 2.7 D (range - 7.5 to - 1.1 D). The 
axial length data both at baseline and at the final visit were obtained only in 
8 eyes. The mean change in axial length during a follow-up in these 8 eyes was 
1.3 mm (range 0-3.7 mm). In the cases with myopia progression, sunset glow 
fundus was more frequent and subfoveal choroid was thinner than those without 
myopia progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Myopia progression as well as increase in axial length occurs in 
VKH disease. The link between choroidal thinning and axial length elongation in 
VKH patients gives some insights into axial length increase of pathologic 
myopia.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the type and degree of both red-green and blue-yellow color 
vision deficiencies of Calabrian males affected by multiple sclerosis.
MATERIAL: Eighty Calabrian male patients were enrolled (age range 18-70 years; 
mean age 40.6 ± 12.4 years) showing a disease duration mean of 10.6 ± 8.2 years 
(range = 0.5-46 years) coming from the Institute of Neurology, Magna Graecia 
University, Catanzaro. Optic neuritis present in the medical histories of the 21 
patients does not influence color vision. Excluding seven colorblind subjects 
and one affected by a bilateral maculopathy, the analyzed sample group was 72. 
Seventy controls were matched for age and sex.
METHOD: An ophthalmologist examined all patients and controls in order to rule 
out diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, senile maculopathy, or ocular fundus' 
anomalies. The Ishihara test identified the colorblind patients. The City 
University Test screened for people with abnormal color vision by grading the 
severity of color vision deficiency. The second part of the City University Test 
as well as the Farnsworth Test confirmed both the color vision deficiency type 
and degree.
RESULTS: Fifty-one percentage (37/72) of the patients showing a color vision 
deficiency were subdivided into two subgroups: subgroup one showed red-green 
deficiency (57%, 21/37); subgroup two showed a coupled red-green and blue-yellow 
deficiency (43%, 16/37). Furthermore, we found two distinct curves showing a 
groove within the first 10 years of the disease. Both monocular and binocular 
analyses allowed us to identify the patients showing the monocular color vision 
deficiency, but they were well compensated by binocular vision.
CONCLUSION: We think that the majority of the patients with the red-green 
deficiency will develop the coupled red-green and blue-yellow deficiency in the 
latter years of multiple sclerosis.

Maintenance of synaptic plasticity reserve is crucial to contrast clinical 
deterioration in MS and PDGF plays a key role in this phenomenon. Indeed, higher 
cerebrospinal fluid PDGF concentration correlates with improved clinical 
recovery after a relapse, and the amplitude of LTP-like cortical plasticity in 
relapsing-remitting MS patients. However, LTP-like cortical plasticity varies 
depending on the individual level of inhibitory cortical circuits. Aim of this 
study was to explore whether PDGF-CSF concentration correlates with inhibitory 
cortical circuits explored by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation in 
patients affected by relapsing-remitting MS. We further performed 
electrophysiological experiments evaluating GABAergic transmission in the 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) hippocampus. Our results reveal 
that increased CSF PDGF concentration correlates with decreased short afferent 
inhibition in the motor cortex in MS patients and decreased GABAergic activity 
in EAE. These findings show that PDGF affects GABAergic activity both in MS 
patients and in EAE hippocampus.

BACKGROUND: Few data are available on very long-term follow-up of pediatric 
multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with disease modifying treatments 
(DMTs).
OBJECTIVES: To present a long-term follow-up of a cohort of Pediatric-MS 
patients starting injectable first-line agents.
METHODS: Data regarding treatments, annualized relapse rate (ARR), Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and serious adverse event were collected. 
Baseline characteristics were tested in multivariate analysis to identify 
predictors of disease evolution.
RESULTS: In total, 97 patients were followed for 12.5 ± 3.3 years. They started 
therapy at 13.9 ± 2.1 years, 88 with interferons and 9 with copaxone. During the 
whole follow-up, 82 patients changed therapy, switching to 
immunosuppressors/second-line treatment in 58% of cases. Compared to 
pre-treatment phase, the ARR was significantly reduced during the first 
treatment (from 3.2 ± 2.6 to 0.7 ± 1.5, p < 0.001), and it remained low during 
the whole follow-up (0.3 ± 0.2, p < 0.001). At last observation, 40% had 
disability worsening, but EDSS score remained <4 in 89%. One patient died at age 
of 23 years due to MS. One case of natalizumab-related progressive multifocal 
encephalopathy (PML) was recorded. Starting therapy before 12 years of age 
resulted in a better course of disease in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric-MS patients benefited from interferons/copaxone, but the 
majority had to switch to more powerful drugs. Starting therapy before 12 years 
of age could lead to a more favorable outcome.

BACKGROUND: Maintaining paid work is a key issue for people with multiple 
sclerosis (PwMS). Different factors, including psychological attributes, can 
influence job retention. Understanding their role should inform potential 
interventions to help PwMS retain employment.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the key factors which improve 
job retention in an employed cohort of PwMS.
METHODS: This three-year longitudinal study used validated self-completed 
measures of physical and psychological factors at four time points over 
28 months.
RESULTS: Of 208 employed PwMS, just over 1 in 10 was no longer working at the 
end of the study. Three variables were predictive of continuing employment; low 
'work instability' at baseline increased the odds of job retention by a factor 
of 12.76; high levels of self-efficacy by a factor of 4.66 and being less than 
50 years of age increased the odds of job retention by a factor of 3.90. Path 
analysis demonstrated the mediating role of self-efficacy between the physical 
impact of MS and the level of work instability at exit.
CONCLUSION: Screening for work instability and self-efficacy in a clinical 
setting followed by appropriate interventions to increase self-efficacy and 
reduce work instability could aid job retention in MS.

B cells play a vital function in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis through an 
array of effector functions. All currently approved MS disease-modifying 
therapies alter the frequency, phenotype, or homing of B cells in one way or 
another. The importance of this mechanism of action has been reinforced with the 
successful development and clinical testing of B-cell-depleting monoclonal 
antibodies that target the CD20 surface antigen. Ocrelizumab, a humanized 
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in March 2017 after pivotal trials showed dramatic reductions in 
inflammatory disease activity in relapsing MS as well as lessening of disability 
progression in primary progressive MS. These and other clinical studies place B 
cells at the center of the inflammatory cascade in MS and provide a launching 
point for development of therapies that target selective pathogenic B-cell 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against natalizumab develop early during 
treatment. ADA persistency is defined by two consecutive positive results as 
performed by the current qualitative ELISA assay (positive/negative). Very 
little is known about the magnitude of the natalizumab ADA response and 
persistency.
DESIGN/METHODS: We developed a highly sensitive natalizumab ADA titration assay 
on the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform and a pharmacokinetic (PK) assay. We 
included 43 patients with a positive ELISA-ADA result within 6 months of 
treatment initiation (baseline) of whom a follow-up serum sample was available 
12-30 months after treatment start. MSD-ADA titres and drug levels were 
measured.
RESULTS: Median MSD-ADA titre at baseline was 4881 and 303 at follow-up. A titre 
of >400 at baseline had a 94% sensitivity and 89% specificity to predict ADA 
persistency. Reversion to ADA negativity occurred in 10 patients with mean drug 
levels of 10.8 μg/mL. The median trough drug level in ADA-positive samples was 
0 µg/mL. PK levels and ADA titres correlated strongly negatively ( r = -0.67).
CONCLUSION: High baseline natalizumab ADA titres accurately predict persistency. 
Despite continuous treatment, the majority of patients with persistent ADA had 
no detectable drug levels indicating loss of efficacy in line with phase 3 study 
results.

BACKGROUND: Increased adiposity is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) and 
is associated with increased disability scores. Adipokines may mediate the 
effects of adiposity on MS disease course.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the association between the 
adipokines (leptin and fatty acid binding protein-4, FABP4) and clinical course 
in individuals with MS.
METHODS: Subjects (18-65 years) with relapsing-remitting MS or clinically 
isolated syndrome and <10 year disease duration were selected from a 
longitudinal clinical study. Cross-sectional and longitudinal models assessed 
the relationship between two adipokines (leptin and FABP4) and disease severity 
in women and men, adjusting for age, disease duration and disease type, Vitamin 
D level, testosterone level, and as well by body mass index (BMI).
RESULTS: Mean age of subjects ( N = 163, 56% women) was 39.3 years. Higher FABP4 
levels were associated with higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 
scores in women in both univariate and multivariate analyses (odds ratio: 1.30; 
p = 0.005). In men, higher FABP4 level was significantly associated with change 
in EDSS over time (estimate: 0.0062; p = 0.035). We found no association of 
FABP4 levels with time to next relapse or a measure of processing speed.
CONCLUSION: FABP4 levels may be associated with increased disability in both men 
and women with MS independent of effects of BMI and other hormones. Future 
studies should expand these analyses and further explore downstream mechanisms 
of adiposity-related effects in MS.

BACKGROUND: Coordinated patterns of gray matter morphology can be represented as 
networks, and network disruptions may explain cognitive dysfunction related to 
multiple sclerosis (MS).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether single-subject gray matter network properties 
are related to impaired cognition in MS.
METHODS: We studied 148 MS patients (99 female) and 33 healthy controls (HC, 21 
female). Seven network parameters were computed and compared within MS between 
cognitively normal and impaired subjects, and associated with performance on 
neuropsychological tests in six cognitive domains with regression models. 
Analyses were controlled for age, gender, whole-brain gray matter volumes, and 
education level.
RESULTS: Compared to MS subjects with normal cognition, MS subjects with 
cognitive impairment showed a more random network organization as indicated by 
lower lambda values (all p < 0.05). Worse average cognition and executive 
function were associated with lower lambda values. Impaired information 
processing speed, working memory, and attention were associated with lower 
clustering values.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that MS subjects with a more randomly 
organized gray matter network show worse cognitive functioning, suggesting that 
single-subject gray matter graphs may capture neurological dysfunction due to 
MS.

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting exocrine 
glands leading to mouth and eyes dryness. The extent to which epigenetic DNA 
methylation changes are responsible for an X-chromosome dose effect has yet to 
be determined. Our objectives were to (i) describe how epigenetic DNA 
methylation changes could explain an X-chromosome dose effect in SS for women 
with normal 46,XX genotype and (ii) determine the relevant relationships to this 
dose effect, between X-linked genes, genes controlling X-chromosome inactivation 
(XCI) and genes encoding associated transcription factors, all of which are 
differentially expressed and/or differentially methylated in the salivary glands 
of patients with SS. We identified 58 upregulated X-chromosome genes, including 
22 genes previously shown to escape XCI, based on the analysis of SS patient 
salivary gland GEO2R gene expression datasets. Moreover, we found XIST and its 
cis regulators RLIM, FTX, and CHIC1, and polycomb repressor genes of the PRC1/2 
complexes to be upregulated. Many of the X-chromosome genes implicated in SS 
pathogenesis can be regulated by transcription factors which we found to be 
overexpressed and/or differentially methylated in patients with SS. 
Determination of the mechanisms underlying methylation-dependent gene expression 
and impaired XCI is needed to further elucidate the etiopathogenesis of SS.

BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMR) data are increasingly used in 
research, but no studies have yet evaluated similarity between EMR and 
research-quality data and between characteristics of an EMR multiple sclerosis 
(MS) population and known natural MS history.
OBJECTIVES: To (1) identify MS patients in an EMR system and extract clinical 
data, (2) compare EMR-extracted data with gold-standard research data, and (3) 
compare EMR MS population characteristics to expected MS natural history.
METHODS: Algorithms were implemented to identify MS patients from the University 
of California San Francisco EMR, de-identify the data and extract clinical 
variables. EMR-extracted data were compared to research cohort data in a subset 
of patients.
RESULTS: We identified 4142 MS patients via search of the EMR and extracted 
their clinical data with good accuracy. EMR and research values showed good 
concordance for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), timed-25-foot walk, and 
subtype. We replicated several expected MS epidemiological features from MS 
natural history including higher EDSS for progressive versus relapsing-remitting 
patients and for male versus female patients and increased EDSS with age at 
examination and disease duration.
CONCLUSION: Large real-world cohorts algorithmically extracted from the EMR can 
expand opportunities for MS clinical research.

BACKGROUND: According to the cognitive reserve (CR) theory, enriching 
experiences protect against cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the dynamic interaction between CR and 
global/regional measures of brain white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) damage 
and their effect on cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: Baseline and 2 -year three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted scans were 
obtained from 54 MS patients and 20 healthy controls. Patients' cognitive 
functions were tested and a cognitive reserve index (CRI) was calculated. 
Baseline regional atrophy and longitudinal volume changes were investigated 
using voxel-wise methods. Structural damage and CRI effects on cognitive 
performance were explored with linear models.
RESULTS: At baseline, MS patients showed atrophy of the deep GM nuclei, GM/WM 
frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital regions, and left cerebellum. Controlling 
for atrophy, higher CRI explained significant portions of variance in verbal 
memory and verbal fluency (∆ R2 = 0.07-0.16; p < 0.03). The interaction between 
thalamic volume and CRI was significant (∆ R2 = 0.05; p = 0.03). Longitudinal 
changes in memory and attention performance were associated with local/global 
variations of GM/WM and T2 lesions. CRI had no effect on longitudinal cognitive 
changes.
CONCLUSION: In MS, CR may have a protective role in preserving cognitive 
functions, moderating the effect of structural damage on cognitive performance. 
This protective role may diminish with disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated 
syndrome (CIS) may show alterations of retinal layer architecture as measured by 
optical coherence tomography. Little is known about changes in the retinal 
vascular network during MS.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize retinal vessel structures in patients with MS and CIS 
and to test for associations with MS disease activity.
METHOD: In all, 42 patients with MS or CIS and 50 healthy controls underwent 
retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) with analysis of the 
superficial and deep vascular plexuses and the choriocapillaries. We tested 
OCT-A parameters for associations with retinal layer volumes, history of optic 
neuritis (ON), and the retrospective disease activity.
RESULTS: Inner retinal layer volumes correlated positively with the density of 
both the superficial and deep vascular plexuses. Eyes of MS/CIS patients with a 
history of ON revealed reduced vessel densities of the superficial and deep 
vascular plexuses as compared to healthy controls. Higher choriocapillary vessel 
densities were associated with ongoing inflammatory disease activity during 24 
months prior to OCT-A examination in MS and CIS patients.
CONCLUSION: Optic neuritis is associated with rarefaction of the superficial and 
deep retinal vessels. Alterations of the choriocapillaries might be linked to 
disease activity in MS.

INTRODUCTION: This study was carried out to investigate the global and regional 
morphometric and iron changes in grey matter (GM) of multiple sclerosis (MS) 
patients and link them to the white matter (WM) lesions in a multimodal magnetic 
resonance imaging approach.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 30 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) 
patients along with 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC) who were scanned on 
a 3T Siemens Trio system. The scanning protocol included a 3D, high resolution 
T1, T2, and T2*-weighted sequences. The T1-w images were used in FreeSurfer for 
cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation, while T2-w images were used 
to extract the WM T2 lesions; however, iron and magnetic susceptibility were 
calculated from the phase data of the T2*-w sequence. Surface-based analyses 
were performed in FreeSurfer to investigate the regional cortical morphometric 
changes and their correlations with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), 
WM T2 lesions load, cortical iron deposition and magnetic susceptibility.
RESULTS: Significant differences were detected between the RRMS patients and HC 
for all cortical and subcortical morphometric changes. The EDSS and T2 lesion 
load showed weak to moderate correlation with the reduced cortical morphometric 
measurements, increased cortical magnetic susceptibility and iron concentration. 
All deep grey matter (dGM) volumes showed a significant strong positive 
correlation with the cortical surface area and volume in RRMS patients and HC.
CONCLUSIONS: Grey matter is very much involved in the RRMS and cortical 
morphometric changes occur in a non-uniform pattern and are very likely to be 
associated with cortical iron deposition and magnetic susceptibility, dGM 
atrophy, WM T2 lesion load, and disability.

Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a severe complication of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study evaluated the clinical factors 
related to outcome in patients with SLE-associated ATM.
METHODS: The medical records of patients diagnosed with SLE-associated ATM 
between January 1995 and January 2015 were reviewed. The patients were divided 
into two groups based on improvement of neurological deficits after treatment: 
favorable response group and unfavorable response group. During follow-up, the 
recurrence of ATM was also analyzed.
RESULTS: ATM was identified in 16 patients with SLE. All of the patients were 
treated with high doses of methylprednisolone (≥ 1 mg/kg daily). Although 12 
patients (75%) recovered (favorable response group), four (25%) had persistent 
neurologic deficits (unfavorable response group) after the treatment. Compared 
to the favorable response group, significantly higher Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000, lower complement levels and initial 
severe neurologic deficits were found in the unfavorable response group. Among 
the 12 favorable response patients, five (41.7%) experienced recurrence of ATM 
during the followup. Patients (n = 5) who experienced relapse had a shorter 
duration of high-dose corticosteroid treatment (13.2 days vs. 32.9 days, p = 
0.01) compared to patients who did not relapse. The mean duration of 
tapering-off the corticosteroid until 10 mg per day was significantly longer in 
non-relapse group (151.3 ± 60.8 days) than in relapse group (63.6 ± 39.4 days, p 
= 0.013).
CONCLUSION: Higher disease activity in SLE and initial severe neurologic 
deficits might be associated with the poor outcome of ATM. Corticosteroid slowly 
tapering-off therapy might be helpful in preventing the recurrence of ATM.

BACKGROUND: The Six Spot Step Test (SSST) extends traditional walking outcomes 
in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) by further challenging components of 
coordination and balance. Nonetheless, the test-retest agreement of the SSST has 
not been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the within-day, day-to-day, and inter-rater agreement 
and reliability of the SSST in PwMS. A secondary aim was to investigate the 
validity of handheld timing.
METHODS: A total of 38 PwMS with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) <6.5 
completed two SSSTs with a 5-minute break in-between. After 2 days, this 
procedure was repeated. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to determine the 95% 
Limits of Agreement (LOA) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was 
calculated. In a subgroup of 18 PwMS, the SSSTs were video-recorded and timed by 
a second investigator.
RESULTS: The relative LOA within and between days were ±15% and ±19%, while ICC 
were 0.987 and 0.983, respectively. A minor learning effect was found over four 
tests. The handheld timing error was ±0.5 seconds when compared to video-based 
timing.
CONCLUSION: The SSST has an acceptable within- and between-day agreement and 
reliability. For interventional purposes, a change of >19% can be regarded as a 
real change. Valid timing can be performed by a handheld stopwatch.

OBJECTIVES: Cervical cytology screening has been successful in reducing deaths 
from cervical cancer. We sought to determine risk factors for abnormal Pap test 
results in women undergoing kidney transplant evaluation.
MATERILAS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined women undergoing kidney 
transplant evaluations from 2008 to 2011. Patients were stratified based on 
normal cytology and atypical/malignant cytology.
RESULTS: Of 404 patients, 293 patients (72.5%) had normal cytologic findings, 
whereas 111 (27.5%) had abnormal findings. On univariate logistic regression 
analyses, patients who had chronic kidney disease with an autoimmune cause (odds 
ratio = 2.71 [95% confidence interval, 1.41-5.19]; P = .003), previous renal 
transplants (odds ratio = 2.64 [95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.82], P = .016), 
or age ≤ 50 years (odds ratio = 1.68 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.61], P = 
.022) were more likely to have abnormal findings. Patients with normal and 
abnormal findings had similar rates of dialysis use. On multivariate logistic 
regression, patients who had chronic kidney disease with autoimmune causes (odds 
ratio = 2.48 [95% confidence interval, 1.26-4.88]; P = .008) and who had 
previous renal transplants (odds ratio = 2.67 [95% confidence interval, 
1.20-5.95]; P = .017) were more likely to have abnormal findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous kidney transplant, autoimmune disease, and age ≤ 50 years 
were associated with abnormalities on cervical cancer screening in our female 
group of patients. Patients with these characteristics may benefit more from 
routine cervical cancer screening than other patients evaluated for kidney 
transplant.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the effects of delivering small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) for efficient STAT3 downregulation on propagation and 
apoptosis of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS).
METHODS: The FLSs were transfected with three different siRNAs. RNAi-1 was 
selected for further experiments. The expression levels of both STAT3 messenger 
RNA (mRNA) and its protein were detected by a real-time polymerase chain 
reaction and Western blot analysis. The proliferation of FLSs was examined by 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The 
apoptosis of FLSs was examined by flow cytometry. The expression levels of cell 
apoptotic-related genes Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 were detected by Western blot 
analysis.
RESULTS: RNAi-1 was selected as the RNAi group for its lowest expression levels 
of STAT3 mRNA. In RNAi group, the proliferation of synoviocytes was much lower 
and the apoptosis rate was significantly higher. FLSs of RNAi-1 group showed 
significantly lower expression level of apoptotic-inhibiting gene Bcl-2 and 
significantly higher expression levels of proapoptotic gene Bax and apoptotic 
protease caspase-3.
CONCLUSION: Transfection with targeted STAT3 recombinant plasmids effectively 
inhibited the expression of STAT3 mRNA and its protein in RA-FLSs. RNAi-mediated 
silencing of STAT3 reduced the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of FLSs.

BACKGROUND: Currently, no unequivocal predictors of disease evolution exist in 
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Cortical atrophy measurements are, 
however, closely associated with cumulative disability.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we aim to forecast longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI)-driven cortical atrophy and clinical disability from cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) markers.
METHODS: We analyzed CSF fractions of albumin and immunoglobulins (Ig) A, G, and 
M and their CSF to serum quotients.
RESULTS: Widespread atrophy was highly associated with increased baseline CSF 
concentrations and quotients of albumin and IgA. Patients with increased CSFIgA 
and CSFIgM showed higher functional disability at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: CSF markers of blood-brain barrier integrity and specific immune 
response forecast emerging gray matter pathology and disease progression in MS.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue occurs in 75%-95% of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 
is frequently reported as the most disabling symptom. A multicomponent group 
program of six weekly 2-hour sessions, Fatigue: Take Control (FTC), was 
developed from an international MS fatigue management guideline.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether FTC is associated with greater improvements in 
fatigue than MS: Take Control (MSTC), a similarly structured general MS 
education program.
METHODS: This four-site, parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled trial 
compared FTC and MSTC in 204 ambulatory participants with MS. The primary 
outcome, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and secondary outcomes of 
self-efficacy, physical activity, sleep, and medications were assessed at 
baseline, program completion, and 3 and 6 months later.
RESULTS: Mean MFIS scores improved in both groups between baseline and program 
completion (FTC -4.4, p < 0.001; MSTC -3.8, p < 0.001), between baseline and 3 
months after program completion (FTC -3.2, p = 0.01; MSTC -3.3, p = 0.01), and 
between baseline and 6 months after program completion (FTC -5.2, p < 0.001; 
MSTC -4.8, p < 0.001). These improvements were not statistically different 
between groups ( p = 0.64, 0.92, and 0.82, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Participation in FTC modestly improved self-reported fatigue for up 
to 6 months. This improvement did not differ significantly from that occurring 
with the control program.

PURPOSE: To assess and compare early modifications in inner retinal layer 
thickness and optical coherence tomography angiography parameters in patients 
with diabetes mellitus (DM) Types 1 and 2 without clinical signs of diabetic 
retinopathy.
METHODS: Ninety eyes of 90 subjects (24 Type 1 DM, 36 Type 2 DM, and 30 healthy 
controls) were prospectively evaluated with spectral domain OCT, swept-source 
OCT angiography, and color fundus photography (on the same day). Retinal nerve 
fiber layer, ganglion cell layer (GCL+), and nerve fiber layer + GCL+ (GCL++) 
thickness were automatically determined by the instrument in the 1, 3, and 6 
central mm. On OCT angiography, the following parameters were evaluated: area of 
foveal avascular zone, number of focally dilated endings of the capillaries 
(detected only on OCT angiography), presence of regular/irregular foveal 
avascular zone, capillary loss, and capillary network irregularities in the 
superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP).
RESULTS: Ganglion cell layer+ (P = 0.0099) and GCL++ (P = 0.0367) were 
significantly thicker in DM Type 1 versus DM Type 2 in 1 central mm, after 
adjustment for age and DM duration. The area of foveal avascular zone was 
significantly larger in DM Type 1 versus controls in both SCP and DCP and in DM 
Type 1 versus Type 2 only in DCP (P < 0.05 for all); the number of focally 
dilated endings of the capillaries was higher in DM Type 1 versus controls in 
both SCP and DCP (P < 0.01 for all); and in DM Type 2 versus controls only in 
DCP (P = 0.007). Perifoveal capillary loss in SCP and inner retinal layer 
thickness had the highest correlation in both DM types.
CONCLUSION: There are specific neural and microvascular modifications even 
before clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy in DM Types 1 and 2. Perifoveal 
capillary loss in the SCP is highly correlated with inner retinal layer. These 
data may help in characterization of patients at the preclinical stage of 
diabetic retinopathy.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the type of support and assistance that patients with 
multiple sclerosis need in order to cope with the loss of functionality, and to 
show how gender affects the perception of these needs.
METHOD: Interpretative-phenomenological qualitative study.
LOCATION: Granada (Spain). Year: 2014. Intentional sample: 30 patients and 20 
family caregivers. Data were gathered from 26 interviews and 4 focus groups. The 
data were coded and analysed with the NVivo programme.
RESULTS: The multiple sclerosis patients and family caregivers had different 
perceptions of the loss of capacity to undertake activities of daily living. 
Being able to self care was considered the last vestige of autonomy. The women 
with multiple sclerosis tried to take on the responsibility of housework, but 
the male caregivers became gradually involved in these tasks. Gender roles were 
redefined with respect to housekeeping. The multiple sclerosis patients showed a 
need for emotional support. Some of the men had abandoned the stereotype of the 
strong male as a result of the decline in their health. Adaptations in the home 
took place without planning them in advance. The use of mobility devices started 
on an occasional basis. A fear of stigma was an obstacle for regular use of 
assistive technology.
CONCLUSIONS: Health care for people with multiple sclerosis should include 
family caregivers. Gender influences the perception that caregivers and patients 
have of the assistance they require to maximise their quality of life. This 
flags up several intervention areas for the follow-up and long-term care of 
these patients by the healthcare system.

BACKGROUND: Impaired olfactory threshold has been reported in early inflammatory 
phases of MS, while impaired odor identification was associated with more 
widespread disability.
OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the development of olfactory function and its 
correlation with relapse and disability progression.
METHODS: In this prospective, 3-year longitudinal study on 151 MS patients and 
30 healthy controls, three different qualities of olfactory function (threshold, 
discrimination, and identification) were quantified using the Sniffin' Sticks 
test. The influence of relapses and disability on olfactory function was 
analyzed at different time points and in a multivariate model.
RESULTS: Discrimination and identification capability significantly worsened 
over 3 years, while threshold did not. Threshold was markedly impaired in 
patients with relapse activity within 12 months, recovered in the absence of 
relapse, and was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of relapse. 
Deterioration of discrimination and identification was irreversible and both 
strongly associated with and predictive of EDSS progression.
CONCLUSION: Olfactory function changes over time in MS. Threshold impairment is 
transient and predicts inflammatory disease activity, while odor identification 
and discrimination are associated with disability progression. Olfactory 
dysfunction might be a useful and easily obtainable parameter to monitor 
patients with regard to inflammation and neurodegeneration in MS.

OBJECTIVES: To map the regional patterns of white matter (WM) microstructural 
abnormalities and gray matter (GM) atrophy exclusively associated with reduced 
performance in the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Paced Auditory Serial 
Addition Test (PASAT) in relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS) 
patients.
METHODS: In all, 177 RRMS patients and 80 healthy controls (HC) were studied. WM 
microstructural abnormalities were investigated on diffusion tensor images using 
tract-based spatial statistics analysis, and regional GM atrophy was estimated 
on three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted images using voxel-based morphometry.
RESULTS: Compared to HC, RRMS patients showed the expected pattern of 
cortical-subcortical GM atrophy and WM microstructural abnormalities. In 
patients, diffusivity abnormalities of supratentorial WM tracts correlated with 
both SDMT and PASAT scores. Lower SDMT performance was also associated with WM 
damage in several infratentorial WM tracts. Lower SDMT scores correlated with 
atrophy of the right anterior cingulate cortex, left postcentral gyrus, and 
right middle temporal gyrus, whereas lower PASAT scores correlated with atrophy 
of the deep GM nuclei, bilaterally, and several fronto-temporo-occipital 
regions.
CONCLUSION: In RRMS patients, regional damage of different neural systems helps 
explaining reduced performance in SDMT and PASAT. WM microstructural damage 
typified reduced SDMT performance, whereas atrophy of several GM regions 
distinguished reduced PASAT performance.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Few studies have addressed whether there are differences in 
clinical efficacy between intravenous methylprednisolone (methyl-Pd) and 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) use.
METHODS: We retrospectively compared platelet responses and toxicities 
associated with these two treatments in adult patients with immune 
thrombocytopenia. Patients received intravenous methyl-Pd therapy followed by 
oral prednisolone (Pd) from 1993 to 2002 and IVIg together with oral Pd from 
2003 to 2008.
RESULTS: Early response and maintenance of the response were assessed at 7 days 
and 6 months after treatment, respectively. Of the 87 patients enrolled, 77 
(88.5%) were eligible for analysis. Early responses occurred in 30 of 39 
patients (76.9%) receiving methyl-Pd versus 33 of 38 patients (86.6%) receiving 
IVIg (p = 0.187). The response was maintained in 28 patients (71.8%) in the 
methyl-Pd arm and in 23 patients (60.5%) in the IVIg arm (p = 0.187). The time 
to a complete response in the IVIg arm (6 days; range, 1 to 35) was shorter than 
that in the methyl-Pd arm (13.5 days; range, 2 to 29) (p = 0.002). Side effects 
were mild and tolerable in both arms. Five years after initiating treatment, 7 
of 18 patients (38.9%) and five of 14 patients (35.7%) were still maintaining a 
response in the methyl-Pd and IVIg arms, respectively.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that neither the early response rate nor the 
long-term outcome differed between the methyl-Pd and IVIg treatments. However, 
IVIg induced a complete response more rapidly than did methyl-Pd.

BACKGROUND: Among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), fatigue is the most 
commonly reported symptom. It can be subdivided into an effort-dependent 
(fatigability) and an effort-independent component (trait-fatigue).
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to disentangle activity changes associated with 
effort-independent "trait-fatigue" from those associated with effort-dependent 
fatigability in MS patients.
METHODS: This study employed behavioral measures and functional magnetic imaging 
to investigate neural changes in MS patients associated with fatigue. A total of 
40 MS patients and 22 age-matched healthy controls performed in a 
fatigue-inducing N-back task. Effort-independent fatigue was assessed using the 
Fatigue Scale of Motor and Cognition (FSMC) questionnaire.
RESULTS: Effort-independent fatigue was observed to be reflected by activity 
increases in fronto-striatal-subcortical networks primarily involved in the 
maintenance of homeostatic processes and in motor and cognitive control. 
Effort-dependent fatigue (fatigability) leads to activity decreases in 
attention-related cortical and subcortical networks.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that effort-independent (fatigue) and 
effort-dependent fatigue (fatigability) in MS patients have functionally related 
but fundamentally different neural correlates. Fatigue in MS as a general 
phenomenon is reflected by complex interactions of activity increases in control 
networks (effort-independent component) and activity reductions in executive 
networks (effort-dependent component) of brain areas.

It is estimated that more than two billion people around the world have been 
infected by Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Reactivation of HBV (rHBV) is a potentially 
fatal complication after biological therapy. With the increasing use of 
biologics and targeted therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who are 
refractory to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, 
rHBV in those with past infection has become increasingly problematic, 
especially in HBV-endemic regions. Among those receiving biological therapy, the 
risk of rHBV varies according to the status of HBV infection and the degree of 
biologic-related immunosuppression. As rHBV is largely preventable, it is 
imperative that the risk status of rHBV in RA patients receiving biological and 
targeted therapy be stratified. Therefore, the aim of this review was to 
summarize the reported data on rHBV, and propose management strategies for RA 
patients with different risks of rHBV based on evidence presented in the current 
literature.

BACKGROUND: Baseline brain volume (BV) is predictive at a group level but is 
difficult to interpret at the single patient level.
OBJECTIVE: To validate BV cutoffs able to identify clinically relevant atrophy 
in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients.
METHODS: The expected normalized brain volume (NBV) for each patient was 
calculated using RRMS patients from two phase III clinical trials, applying a 
linear formula developed on the baseline variable of an independent data set. 
The difference between these expected NBV values and those actually observed was 
calculated and used to categorize the patients in the low-NBV, medium-NBV, and 
high-NBV groups.
RESULTS: The 2-year probability of 3-month confirmed disability worsening was 
significantly associated with the NBV categorization ( p = 0.006), after 
adjusting for treatment effect. Taking the high-NBV group as a reference, the 
hazard ratios for the medium-NBV and low-NBV groups were 1.22 (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.85-1.76, p = 0.27) and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.11-2.57, p = 0.01), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of BV cutoffs to identify clinically 
relevant atrophy in RRMS study by showing that the three groups classified 
according to the baseline NBV adjusted for the other prognostic variables have a 
significant prognostic impact on the risk of disability progression.

BACKGROUND: B cells may be involved in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis 
(MS). Inebilizumab (formerly MEDI-551) binds to and depletes CD19+ B cells.
OBJECTIVES: To assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
and immunogenicity of inebilizumab in adults with relapsing MS.
METHODS: This phase 1 trial randomised 28 patients 3:1 (21, inebilizumab; 7, 
placebo) to inebilizumab (2 intravenous (IV) doses, days 1 and 15: 30, 100 or 
600 mg; or single subcutaneous (SC) dose on day 1: 60 or 300 mg) or matching 
placebo, with follow-up until at least week 24 or return of CD19+ B-cell count 
to ⩾80 cells/µL.
RESULTS: Complete B-cell depletion was observed across all doses. 
Infusion/injection (grade 1/2) reactions occurred in 6/15 patients receiving 
inebilizumab IV, 2/5 placebo IV and 1/6 inebilizumab SC. Serious adverse events 
occurred in three patients receiving inebilizumab: pyrexia, mixed-drug 
intoxication (unrelated to inebilizumab; resulted in death) and urinary tract 
infection. Mean number of cumulative new gadolinium-enhancing lesions over 
24 weeks was 0.1 with inebilizumab versus 1.3 with placebo; mean numbers of 
new/newly enlarging T2 lesions were 0.4 and 2.4, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Inebilizumab had an acceptable safety profile in relapsing MS 
patients and showed a trend in reductions in new/newly enlarging and 
gadolinium-enhancing lesions.

BACKGROUND: Morphologic macular abnormalities (MMAs) are frequently seen on 
macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in neuroimmunology practice, 
yet studies pragmatically assessing prevalence and risk factors of MMAs to date 
are limited.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of MMAs in a neuroimmunology-based 
academic practice.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 1450 patients (2900 eyes) who underwent 
spectral-domain macular OCT between June 2010 and June 2012. The association 
between MMAs and demographic variables was analyzed using mixed-effects logistic 
regression. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated per 5-year age increments.
RESULTS: MMAs were observed in 338/2872 eyes (11.7%) of 232/1445 participants 
(16.1%). The most common abnormalities identified, included drusen (6.0%), 
epiretinal membrane (ERM; 5.5%), and microcystoid macular pathology (MMP; 1.9%). 
Overall, patients with MMAs were older (OR: 1.79, p = 5 × 10-5) and more likely 
to be males (OR: 2.45, p = 0.014). In particular, advancing age was associated 
with higher risk of drusen and ERM (OR: 1.80 and 4.26, p = 2 × 10-5 and 
7 × 10-3, respectively). MMP prevalence declined with age (OR: 0.73, p = 0.015) 
and was associated with African-American ethnicity (OR: 15.0, p = 5 × 10-5).
CONCLUSION: Unexpected or incidental MMAs are common in patients assessed with 
OCT in neuroimmunology practice, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive OCT 
image review for risk stratification and appropriate ophthalmology referral.

Longitudinal data are often collected in biomedical applications in such a way 
that measurements on more than one response are taken from a given subject 
repeatedly overtime. For some problems, these multiple profiles need to be 
modeled jointly to get insight on the joint evolution and/or association of 
these responses over time. In practice, such longitudinal outcomes may have many 
zeros that need to be accounted for in the analysis. For example, in dietary 
intake studies, as we focus on in this paper, some food components are eaten 
daily by almost all subjects, while others are consumed episodically, where 
individuals have time periods where they do not eat these components followed by 
periods where they do. These episodically consumed foods need to be adequately 
modeled to account for the many zeros that are encountered. In this paper, we 
propose a joint model to analyze multivariate hierarchical semicontinuous data 
characterized by many zeros and more than one replicate observations at each 
measurement occasion. This approach allows for different probability mechanisms 
for describing the zero behavior as compared with the mean intake given that the 
individual consumes the food. To deal with the potentially large number of 
multivariate profiles, we use a pairwise model fitting approach that was 
developed in the context of multivariate Gaussian random effects models with 
large number of multivariate components. The novelty of the proposed approach is 
that it incorporates: (1) multivariate, possibly correlated, response variables; 
(2) within subject correlation resulting from repeated measurements taken from 
each subject; (3) many zero observations; (4) overdispersion; and (5) replicate 
measurements at each visit time.

PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence, activity limitations and potential risk 
factors of upper extremity impairments in type 1 diabetes in comparison to 
controls.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional population-based study in the southeast of Sweden, 
patients with type 1 diabetes <35 years at onset, duration ≥20 years, <67 years 
old and matched controls were invited to answer a questionnaire on upper 
extremity impairments and activity limitations and to take blood samples.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and seventy-three patients (ages 50 ± 10 years, diabetes 
duration 35 ± 10 years) and 708 controls (ages 54 ± 9 years) were included. 
Shoulder pain and stiffness, hand paraesthesia and finger impairments were 
common in patients with a prevalence of 28-48%, which was 2-4-folds higher than 
in controls. Compared to controls, the patients had more bilateral impairments, 
often had coexistence of several upper extremity impairments, and in the 
presence of impairments, reported more pronounced activity limitations. Female 
gender (1.72 (1.066-2.272), p = 0.014), longer duration (1.046 (1.015-1.077), 
p = 0.003), higher body mass index (1.08 (1.017-1.147), p = 0.013) and HbA1c 
(1.029 (1.008-1.05), p = 0.007) were associated with upper extremity 
impairments.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to controls, patients with type 1 diabetes have a high 
prevalence of upper extremity impairments, often bilateral, which are strongly 
associated with activity limitations. Recognising these in clinical practise is 
crucial, and improved preventative, therapeutic and rehabilitative interventions 
are needed. Implications for rehabilitation Upper extremity impairments 
affecting the shoulder, hand and fingers are common in patients with type 1 
diabetes, the prevalence being 2-4-fold higher compared to non-diabetic persons. 
Patients with diabetes type 1 with upper extremity impairments have more 
pronounced limitations in daily activities compared to controls with similar 
impairments. Recognising upper extremity impairments and activity limitations 
are important and improved preventive, therapeutic and rehabilitation methods 
are needed.

BACKGROUND: Peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thickness is 
emerging as a marker of axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS).
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively assess the predictive value of pRNFL for 
progression of physical and cognitive disability in relapsing-remitting MS 
(RRMS).
METHODS: In this 3-year longitudinal study on 151 RRMS patients, pRNFL was 
measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). We used 
proportional hazard models, correcting for age, sex, disease duration, Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at 
baseline, to test a pRNFL thickness ≤88 µm at baseline for prediction of EDSS 
progression and cognitive decline. We also evaluated the decrease in pRNFL 
thickness from baseline to year 3 in a multivariate linear regression model.
RESULTS: pRNFL thickness ≤88 µm was independently associated with a threefold 
increased risk of EDSS progression ( p < 0.001) and a 2.7-fold increased risk of 
cognitive decline within the subsequent 3 years ( p < 0.001). Mean pRNFL delta 
was -5.3 µm (SD, 4.2). It was significantly negatively impacted by EDSS 
progression, cognitive decline, higher age and disease duration, while 
positively impacted by disease-modifying therapy (DMT).
CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional and longitudinal monitoring of pRNFL is useful as a 
biomarker for prediction of physical and cognitive disability progression in 
patients with RRMS in everyday clinical practice.

Markov models are commonly used for decision-making studies in many application 
domains; however, there are no widely adopted methods for performing sensitivity 
analysis on such models with uncertain transition probability matrices (TPMs). 
This article describes two simulation-based approaches for conducting 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis on a given discrete-time, finite-horizon, 
finite-state Markov model using TPMs that are sampled over a specified 
uncertainty set according to a relevant probability distribution. The first 
approach assumes no prior knowledge of the probability distribution, and each 
row of a TPM is independently sampled from the uniform distribution on the row's 
uncertainty set. The second approach involves random sampling from the 
(truncated) multivariate normal distribution of the TPM's maximum likelihood 
estimators for its rows subject to the condition that each row has nonnegative 
elements and sums to one. The two sampling methods are easily implemented and 
have reasonable computation times. A case study illustrates the application of 
these methods to a medical decision-making problem involving the evaluation of 
treatment guidelines for glycemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes, 
where natural variation in a patient's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is modeled as 
a Markov chain, and the associated TPMs are subject to uncertainty.

A , Diepenbeek , Belgium.

PURPOSE: High-intensity concurrent training positively affects cardiovascular 
risk factors. Because this was never investigated in multiple sclerosis, the 
present pilot study explored the impact of this training on cardiovascular risk 
factors in this population.
METHODS: Before and after 12 weeks of high-intense concurrent training (interval 
and strength training, 5 sessions per 2 weeks, n = 16) body composition, resting 
blood pressure and heart rate, 2-h oral glucose tolerance (insulin sensitivity, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, blood glucose and insulin concentrations), blood lipids 
(high- and low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglyceride levels) and 
C-reactive protein were analyzed.
RESULTS: Twelve weeks of high-intense concurrent training significantly improved 
resting heart rate (-6%), 2-h blood glucose concentrations (-13%) and insulin 
sensitivity (-24%). Blood pressure, body composition, blood lipids and 
C-reactive protein did not seem to be affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this pilot study, 12 weeks of concurrent 
high-intense interval and strength training improved resting heart rate, 2-h 
glucose and insulin sensitivity in multiple sclerosis but did not affect blood 
C-reactive protein levels, blood pressure, body composition and blood lipid 
profiles. Further, larger and controlled research investigating the effects of 
high-intense concurrent training on cardiovascular risk factors in multiple 
sclerosis is warranted. Implications for rehabilitation High-intensity 
concurrent training improves cardiovascular fitness. This pilot study explores 
the impact of this training on cardiovascular risk factors in multiple 
sclerosis. Despite the lack of a control group, high-intense concurrent training 
does not seem to improve cardiovascular risk factors in multiple sclerosis.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to (1) explore and (2) compare 
circumstances of falls among full-time wheelchair users with spinal cord injury 
(SCI) and multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: A mixed method approach was used to explore and compare the 
circumstances of falls of 41 full-time wheelchair users with SCI (n = 23) and MS 
(n = 18). In addition to collecting participants' demographic information (age, 
gender, type of wheelchair used, duration of wheelchair use, and duration of 
disability), self-reported fall frequency in the past 6 months, self-reported 
restriction in activity due to fear of falling and the Spinal Cord Injury-Fall 
Concerns Scale (SCI-FCS) was collected. Qualitative data in the form of 
participants' responses to an open-ended question yielding information regarding 
the circumstances of the most recent fall were also collected. To examine 
differences in survey outcomes and demographic characteristics between 
participants with SCI and MS, independent t-tests and Pearson's Chi-square tests 
were used. Qualitative data were analyzed with a thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that individuals with MS (mean =3.3) had 
significantly higher average SCI-FCS than individuals with SCI (mean =2.4). The 
analysis of the participants' descriptions of the circumstances of their most 
recent falls resulted in three main categories: action-related fall contributors 
(e.g., transfer), (2) location of falls (e.g., bathroom), and (3) fall 
attributions (e.g., surface condition).
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study helped to understand fall circumstances 
among full-time wheelchair users with MS and SCI. Findings from this study can 
inform the development of evidenced-based interventions to improve the 
effectiveness of clinically based treatment protocols. Implications for 
rehabilitation Falls are a common health concern in full-time wheelchair users 
living with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The circumstances 
surrounding falls reported by full-time wheelchair users living with multiple 
sclerosis and spinal cord injuries were found to be multifactorial. The complex 
nature of falls must be taken into consideration in the development of fall 
prevention programs. Findings from this study can inform the development of 
comprehensive evidence-based, population-specific interventions to manage falls 
among full-time wheelchair users living with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord 
injury.

PURPOSE: To cross-culturally translate the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale 
into Italian and to evaluate its psychometric properties in patients with 
multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: The Italian version of Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale was 
developed in accordance with international standards and subsequently 
administered to 232 Italian adults with multiple sclerosis. The following 
psychometric properties were analyzed: internal consistency through Cronbach's α 
and item-to-total correlation, dimensionality with factor analysis, and 
convergent and criterion validity through hypotheses-testing, comparing the 
Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale with other outcome measures (Fatigue 
Severity Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life, Modified Ashworth Scale, 
Barthel Index, and Expanded Disability Status Scale) and analyzing related 
constructs. Finally, we correlated the MSSS-88 subscales with each other.
RESULTS: The final Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale version was 
well-understood by all subjects. The internal consistency was good (Cronbach's α 
≥0.90). Factor analysis revealed that each subscale was unidimensional. 
Convergent and criterion validity were supported by acceptable correlations with 
other disease-specific questionnaires, according to the a priori expectations.
CONCLUSIONS: The final Italian Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale version 
showed robust psychometric properties. Therefore, it can be recommended as an 
assessment tool for clinical and research use to evaluate spasticity in Italian 
patients with multiple sclerosis. Implications for rehabilitation The Multiple 
Sclerosis Spasticity Scale was developed to measure patients' perception of the 
impact of spasticity on life of subjects with multiple sclerosis. In a sample of 
Italian subjects with multiple sclerosis, the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity 
Scale revealed good internal consistency and convergent and criterion validity. 
Factor analysis demonstrated that each subscale was unidimensional. Each 
subscale can be used to assess the impact of spasticity in Italian patients with 
multiple sclerosis.

Members of the interleukin (IL)-10 family of cytokines play important roles in 
regulating immune responses during host defense but also in autoimmune 
disorders, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. Although IL-10 itself primarily 
acts on leukocytes and has potent immunosuppressive functions, other family 
members preferentially target nonimmune compartments, such as tissue epithelial 
cells, where they elicit innate defense mechanisms to control viral, bacterial, 
and fungal infections, protect tissue integrity, and promote tissue repair and 
regeneration. As cytokines are prime drug targets, IL-10 family cytokines 
provide great opportunities for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, tissue 
damage, and cancer. Yet no therapy in this space has been approved to date. 
Here, we summarize the diverse biology of the IL-10 family as it relates to 
human disease and review past and current strategies and challenges to target 
IL-10 family cytokines for clinical use.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine coping strategies 
that people with multiple sclerosis use, and to identify factors that influence 
their coping pattern.
METHOD: This systematic review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines 
for synthesizing descriptive quantitative research. The following databases were 
searched from the inception of databases until December 2016: Ovid (Medline, 
Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO), Science Direct, Web of Science, and Scopus. 
Manual search was also conducted from the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Findings related to the patterns of coping with multiple sclerosis and factors 
influencing coping with multiple sclerosis were extracted and synthesized.
RESULTS: The search of the database yielded 455 articles. After excluding 
duplicates (n = 341) and studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria 
(n = 27), 71 studies were included in the full-text review. Following the 
full-text, a further 21 studies were excluded. Quality appraisal of 50 studies 
was completed, and 38 studies were included in the review. Synthesis of findings 
indicated that people with multiple sclerosis use emotional and avoidance coping 
strategies more than other types of coping, particularly in the early stages of 
the disease. In comparison to the general population, people with multiple 
sclerosis were less likely to use active coping strategies and used more 
avoidance and emotional coping strategies. The pattern of coping with multiple 
sclerosis was associated with individual, clinical and psychological factors 
including gender, educational level, clinical course, mood and mental status, 
attitude, personality traits, and religious beliefs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review suggest that considering individual or 
disease-related factors could help healthcare professionals in identifying those 
less likely to adapt to multiple sclerosis. This information could also be used 
to provide client-centered rehabilitation for people living with multiple 
sclerosis based on their individual responses and perceptions for coping. 
Implications for rehabilitation Engagement in coping with multiple sclerosis has 
been associated with individual factors and neuropsychological functions. 
Considering individual and disease-related factors would allow healthcare 
professionals to provide more tailored interventions to maintain and master 
coping with multiple sclerosis. People living with multiple sclerosis should be 
empowered to appraise and manage ability to cope based on the contextual 
evidence (individual and clinical condition). Rehabilitation services should 
move beyond physical management incorporating behavioral aspects for better 
functioning in living with multiple sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and 
Health is the international standard for describing and monitoring functioning. 
While the categories, the units of the classification, were not designed with 
measurement in mind, the hierarchical structure of the classification lends 
itself to the possibility of summating categories into some higher order domain. 
Focusing on the chapters of d4 Mobility, d5 Self-Care and d6 Domestic Life, this 
study seeks to ascertain if qualifiers rating of categories (0-No problem to 
4-Complete problem) within those chapters can be summated, and whether such 
derived measurement is consistent with estimates obtained from well-known 
instruments which purport to measure the same constructs.
METHODS: The current study applies secondary analysis to data previously 
collected in the context of validating Core Sets for stroke, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Data included qualifier-based ratings of the 
categories in the Core Sets, and the physical functioning sub-scale of the 
Short-Form 36, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 
2.0. To examine qualifier-comparator scale item agreement Kappa statistics were 
used. To identify whether appropriate gradients of the comparator scales were 
observed across qualifier levels, an Independent Sample Median Test of the 
ordinal scores was deployed. To investigate the internal validity of the 
summated ICF categories, the Rasch model was applied.
RESULTS: Data from 2,927 subjects from Europe, Australasia, Middle East and 
South America were available for analysis; 36.3% had experienced a stroke, 35.8% 
osteoarthritis, and 27.9% had rheumatoid arthritis. The items from the 
Short-Form 36 could not match directly the qualifier categories as the former 
had only 3 response options. The Kappa between World Health Organization 
Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 items and categories was low. For all 
qualifiers, a significant (<0.001) overall gradient was observed across the 
comparator scales. Only in few of the World Health Organization Disability 
Assessment Schedule 2.0 items could no discrete level be detected. The 
aggregation of the qualifiers at the Chapter and higher order levels mostly 
revealed fit to the Rasch model. Almost all ICF qualifiers showed ordered 
thresholds suggesting that the current structure and response options of the 
qualifiers worked as intended.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide supporting evidence for the use 
of the professionally rated categories and associated qualifiers to measure 
functioning. Implication for Rehabilitation This study provides evidence that 
functioning data can be collected directly with the International Classification 
of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by using the ICF categories as items 
and the ICF qualifiers as rating scale. The findings of this study show the 
aggregated ratings of ICF categories from the chapters d4 Mobility, d5 
Self-care, and d6 Domestic life capture a broader spectrum of the construct than 
the corresponding summated items from the SF36-Physical Function sub-scale and 
the corresponding items of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment 
Schedule 2.0. This study illustrates the potential of building quantitative 
measurement by aggregating ICF categories and their qualifier ratings into 
meaningful domains.

PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to analyze the correlations between the 
expression of glucose transporters GLUT-1, GLUT-4, and GLUT-9 in human term 
placenta and selected maternal and fetal parameters in pregnancies complicated 
by diabetes mellitus (DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Placental samples were obtained from healthy control 
(n = 25) and diabetic pregnancies, including diet-controlled gestational 
diabetes mellitus (GDMG1) (n = 16), insulin-controlled gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDMG2) (n = 6), and pregestational DM (PGDM) (n = 6). 
Computer-assisted quantitative morphometry of stained placental sections was 
performed to determine the expression of selected glucose transporter proteins. 
For the purposes of correlation analysis, the following parameters were 
selected: type of diabetes, gestational age, maternal prepregnancy body mass 
index (BMI), gestational weight gain, third trimester glycated hemoglobin 
concentration, placental weight, fetal birth weight (FBW) as well as 
ultrasonographic indicators of fetal adiposity, including subscapular (SSFM), 
abdominal (AFM), and midthigh (MTFM) fat mass measurements.
RESULTS: In the PGDM group, the analysis demonstrated positive correlations 
between the placental expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-4, and GLUT-9 and FBW, AFM, and 
SSFM measurements (p < .05). Similarly in the GDMG2 patients positive 
correlations between GLUT-4 expression, FBW and SSFM were observed (p < .05). In 
the multivariate regression analysis, only the type of diabetes and FBW were 
significantly associated with GLUTs expression (p < .001). In addition, maternal 
prepregnancy BMI significantly contributed to GLUT-1 expression (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study results revealed that placental expression of GLUT-1, 
GLUT-4, and GLUT-9 may be involved in the intensification of the fetal growth in 
pregnancies complicated by GDM/PGDM.

Short- and long-term consequences for offspring exposed to maternal diabetes: a 
review.

The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus is increasing, as is the 
worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity, even in children and 
adolescents. Exposure in utero to maternal diabetes carries several short-term 
consequences due mainly to maternal hyperglycemia, and consequent fetal 
hyperinsulinemia. Current evidence also supports the hypothesis that adult 
health and disease have developmental origins, and that disorders in early-life 
environments prompt metabolic imprinting that results in a greater risk of 
negative metabolic outcomes later in life. In particular, exposure in utero to 
maternal diabetes seems to influence long-term metabolic outcomes, carrying a 
higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and thus creating a vicious cycle 
for future generations. In this paper, the short- and long-term consequences of 
exposure in utero to hyperglycemia are reviewed, focusing particularly on the 
long-term metabolic consequences, and investigating the possible pathogenic 
mechanisms involved.

PURPOSE: Considering the number of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients referred for 
clinical spinal cord imaging, the optimization of imaging protocols plays 
a crucial role. We aimed to evaluate the use of proton density (PD) turbo 
spin-echo (TSE) with spectral attenuated inversion recovery (SPAIR) fat 
suppression and compare it with the currently recommended T2-TSE-SPAIR in 
sagittal plane in cervical spinal cord imaging.
METHODS: In this study 35 MS patients with clinically suspected or known spinal 
cord lesions were scanned on a 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. In 
addition to the routine protocol, PD-TSE-SPAIR sequences were obtained to 
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate lesion detectability and image quality 
compared to T2-TSE-SPAIR sequences. Quantitative analysis was based on 
measurements of lesion-to-cord contrast ratio (LCCR), lesion contrast-to-noise 
ratio (LCNR) and lesion dimensions and the qualitative analysis on ranking with 
a predetermined score scale. The presence of lesions in these sequences was 
verified in axial T2 multi-echo gradient echo images.
RESULTS: In quantitative analysis, the lesions on PD-TSE-SPAIR had statistically 
significantly higher contrast (p < 0.05), according to the statistical test of 
LCCR, LCNR calculated contrast and measured lesion dimensions. Qualitative 
analyses were congruent with quantitative results; the median rank of 
PD-TSE-SPAIR was significantly higher than T2-TSE-SPAIR (p < 0.05). Of the 34 
detected lesions 9 (26%) were not visualized in T2-TSE-SPAIR sequence.
CONCLUSION: Considering its superiority in contrast ratios and lesion dimensions 
when compared to T2-TSE-SPAIR in both qualitative and quantitative analyses, we 
therefore recommend PD-TSE-SPAIR as a pivotal sequence to evaluate demyelinating 
spinal cord lesions at 3T.

IL-17A is a cytokine which is produced by several immune and non-immune cells. 
The cytokine plays dual roles from protection from microbes and protection from 
pro-inflammatory based diseases to induction of the pro-inflammatory based 
diseases. The main mechanisms which lead to the controversial roles of IL-17A 
are yet to be clarified. Gut microbiota (GM) are the resident probiotic bacteria 
in the gastrointestinal tracts which have been introduced as a plausible 
regulator of IL-17A production and functions. This review article describes the 
recent information regarding the roles played by GM in determination of IL-17A 
functions outcome.

BACKGROUND: Female adolescents with type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM) have an 
increased risk of developing eating disorders (ED) due to the dietary 
recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate the association between dietary intake and increased risk 
of ED.
METHODS: Case-control study with 50 T1DM female adolescents (11-16 years) and 
100 healthy peers (CG). Measures included food frequency questionnaire (FFQ-PP), 
Child-EDE.12, economic and anthropometric data.
RESULTS: Comparing female adolescents with T1DM vs CG, the first had higher 
intake of: bread, cereal, rice, and pasta (29.7 vs 23.8%, p = 0.001), vegetables 
(6.5 vs 2.8%, p < 0.001), milk yogurt and cheese (9.9 vs 7.6%, p = 0.032), fat, 
and oils (8.2 vs 5.9%, p = 0.003), besides higher fiber intake (19.2 vs 14.7%, 
p = 0.006) and lower consumption of sweets (13.6 vs 30.7%, p < 0.001). No 
differences on ED psychopathology (Child-EDE subscales and global score) were 
found between groups. In unadjusted association between the ED psychopathology 
and dietary intake, a diet rich in fiber was significantly associated with both 
the global and eating concern scores. Among CG, increased intake of meat, 
poultry, fish, and eggs and decreased bread, cereal, rice, and pasta consumption 
were significantly associated with higher ED psychopathology. When BMI and age 
are adjusted, the association between fiber intake and ED psychopathology is no 
longer significant among diabetic participants; however, in the CG, this 
association remains.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that an association between dietary intake and 
ED psychopathology might exist in female adolescents with and without TIDM and 
that careful evaluation of the dietary profile and risk of developing an ED 
should be considered in clinical practice.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control study.

OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune 
disease of the central nervous system (CNS), are accompanied by various 
undesirable side effects. Owing to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects 
of walnut, we investigated its effects on the experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS.
METHODS: After EAE induction in mice, the treated group was gavaged daily with 
walnut oil. The weights and clinical symptoms were monitored daily for 21 days 
following the onset of symptoms. The spleens and brains of the mouse were 
removed and used for ELISA and histological studies.
RESULTS: The average disease severity and plaque formation in the brains of the 
walnut oil-treated group were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of the 
untreated group. Stimulated splenocytes of the treated group expressed 
significantly less INF-γ and interleukin (IL)-17 than the untreated group with 
no significant differences in IL-10 or IL-5 production. In serum from the 
treated group, IL-17 expression was also significantly less than in the 
untreated group, while IL-10 was greater (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Walnut oil significantly reduced disease severity, inhibited plaque 
formation, and altered cytokine production. More studies are required to 
identify the mechanism of action of walnut oil as a valuable supplement in the 
treatment of MS.

INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has an important impact in 
diagnosing primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). However, 
neuroradiologic findings may vary immensely, making an easy and definite 
diagnosis challenging.
METHODS: In this retrospective, single center study, we analyzed neuroradiologic 
findings of patients with PACNS diagnosed at our hospital between 2009 and 2014. 
Furthermore, we classified patients according to the affected vessel size and 
compared imaging characteristics between the subgroups.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included (mean age 43 [±15.3] years, 
17 females) in this study. Patients with positive angiographic findings were 
classified as either medium or large vessel PACNS and presented more ischemic 
lesions (p < 0.001) and vessel wall enhancement (p = 0.017) compared to patients 
with small vessel PACNS. No significant differences were detected for the 
distribution of contrast-enhancing lesions (parenchymal or leptomeningeal), 
hemorrhages, or lesions with mass effect. Twenty-five patients underwent brain 
biopsy. Patients with medium or large vessel PACNS were less likely to have 
positive biopsy results.
DISCUSSION: It is essential to differentiate between small and medium/large 
vessel PACNS since results in MRI, digital subtraction angiography and brain 
biopsy may differ immensely. Since image quality of MR scanners improves 
gradually and brain biopsy may often be nonspecific or negative, our results 
emphasize the importance of MRI/MRA in the diagnosis process of PACNS.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a condition that predominantly affects 
women. Reports of pregnancy outcome in these patients are limited and 
contradictory.
OBJECTIVE: To describe pregnancy characteristics and outcomes and newborn 
morbidity in women with pSS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included women with pSS who became pregnant after the 
onset of the symptoms of the disease. Clinical and serological characteristics, 
risk factors and previous maternal comorbidities are described. For each 
pregnancy in a woman with pSS, we recorded pregnancy course and outcome and 
newborn condition.
RESULTS: We assessed 11 patients with 18 pregnancies after the onset of pSS 
symptoms. All of them presented FAN +; 10 anti-Ro / SSA + and 7 anti-La / SSB +. 
The mean age in years at the onset of symptoms was 24.9 (SD 6.9) and at the time 
of pregnancy was 30.3 (SD 5.4). Thirteen pregnancies happened before the 
diagnosis, reporting only one miscarriage. Two preterm births, 1 case of 
oligohydramnios, 2 of premature membrane rupture and 2 low birthweight babies 
were reported after the onset of pSS symptoms. There was 1 newborn with 
congenital atrioventricular block and another with neonatal cutaneous lupus. All 
the women with pregnancy complications (n=6) had anti-Ro/SSA antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the pregnancies assessed in women with pSS were 
associated with complications not attributable to factors other than the 
disease.

This study examined nonverbal intelligence and scholastic achievement in 
children with type 1 diabetes. In a retrospective case-control study, 69 
children (35 males) ages 5-10 years with type 1 diabetes and 69 healthy controls 
matched to patients by age, gender and socioeconomic status were compared 
according to their performance on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and 
their scholastic grades. No differences in nonverbal intelligence and grades 
were observed between children with type 1 diabetes and healthy control 
subjects. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices scores inversely correlated with 
duration of illness both in children with early onset of type 1 diabetes and 
poor metabolic control. Possible explanations of the results and implications 
are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gallstone disease and identify associated 
risk factors in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients compared to the general 
population.
METHODS: Eighty-four women with rheumatoid arthritis were included in the study. 
Each patient was assessed via a structured interview, physical examination, 
abdominal ultrasound and blood test including lipid profile. The prevalence of 
gallstone disease in rheumatoid arthritis was compared with data from a study of 
the Spanish population matched by age groups.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight of the 84 women had gallstone disease (33.3%). RA women 
with and without gallstone disease were similar in most of the variables 
assessed, except for older age and menopausal status in the former. A greater 
prevalence of gallstone disease was seen in rheumatoid arthritis patients 
compared to the general population of the same age; however, the differences 
were significant only in women aged 60 or older (45.5% versus 23.1% 
respectively, P-value .008). The age-adjusted OR of developing gallstone disease 
in RA women compared with general population women was 2,3 (95% CI: 1.3-4.1). A 
significantly higher HDL3-c subfraction and higher apoA-I/HDL and HDL3-c/TC 
ratios were observed in patients with gallstone disease.
CONCLUSION: Women with rheumatoid arthritis may have a predisposition to 
gallstones that can manifest in middle or older age compared with women in the 
general population. This situation could be related to chronic inflammation and 
HDL metabolism.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of tocilizumab 
(TCZ) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a real-world clinical 
setting in Taiwan.
METHOD: All refractory RA patients who initiated intravenous TCZ between August 
2012 and March 2015 were enrolled. Data on patient characteristics, drug safety 
and effectiveness were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 114 RA patients were recruited. Despite the majority of them 
(93%) had previous biologic failure, 43.75% of the patients were able to reach 
ACR50 after one year. Serious adverse events commonly found were bacterial 
pneumonia (4.24/100 patient-years) followed by cellulitis (2.12/100 
patient-years). Twenty-three patients had old or latent TB infections, 11 
patients had chronic hepatitis B. During the 3 years follow-up, none of them had 
reactivation of TB, or hepatitis B with concomitant use of isoniazid prophylaxis 
or pre-emptive antiviral treatment.
CONCLUSION: In this 3-year real-world study on RA patients of Taiwan, we found a 
good long-term effectiveness and similar safety profiles for the TCZ treatment. 
With prophylactic strategy for latent TB and pre-emptive antiviral treatment for 
HBV carriers, the risk of reactivation of latent TB and HBV may be reassured.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of comorbidities in patients with RA in 
Spain and discuss their management and implications using data from the Spanish 
cohort of the multinational study on COMOrbidities in Rheumatoid Arthritis 
(COMORA).
METHODS: This is a national sub-analysis of the COMORA study. We studied the 
demographics and disease characteristics of 200 adults patients diagnosed with 
RA (1987 ACR), and routine practices for screening and preventing the following 
selected comorbidities: cardiovascular, infections, cancer, gastrointestinal, 
pulmonary, osteoporosis and depression.
RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 58 years and a mean RA duration of 10 years. 
Mean DAS28 score was 3.3 and approximately 25% of patients were in remission 
(DAS28 <2.6). Forty-four (22%) patients had ≥1 comorbidity, the most frequent 
being depression (27%) and obesity (26%). A history of myocardial infarction or 
stroke was observed in 5% and 1% of patients, respectively, and any solid tumor 
in 6%. Having a Framingham Risk Score >20% (51%), hypercholesterolemia (46%) or 
hypertension (41%) and smoking (25%) were the most common CV risk factors. For 
prostate, colon and skin cancers, only 9%, 10% and 18% of patients, 
respectively, were optimally monitored. Infections were also inadequately 
managed, with 7% and 17% of patients vaccinated against influenza and 
pneumococcal, respectively, as was osteoporosis, with 47% of patients 
supplemented with vitamin D and 56% with a bone densitometry performed.
CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, the prevalence of comorbidities and CV risk factors in RA 
patients with established and advanced disease is relatively high, and their 
management in clinical daily practice remains suboptimal.

Cognitive impairment (CI) affects 40-65% of patients with multiple sclerosis 
(MS). CI can have a negative impact on a patient's everyday activities, such as 
engaging in conversations. Speech production planning ability is crucial for 
successful verbal interactions and thus for preserving social and occupational 
skills. This study investigates the effect of cognitive-linguistic demand and CI 
on speech production planning in MS, as reflected in speech prosody. A secondary 
aim is to explore the clinical potential of prosodic features for the prediction 
of an individual's cognitive status in MS. A total of 45 subjects, that is 22 
healthy controls (HC) and 23 patients in early stages of relapsing-remitting MS, 
underwent neuropsychological tests probing specific cognitive processes involved 
in speech production planning. All subjects also performed a read speech task, 
in which they had to read isolated sentences manipulated as for phonological 
length. Results show that the speech of MS patients with CI is mainly affected 
at the temporal level (articulation and speech rate, pause duration). Regression 
analyses further indicate that rate measures are correlated with working memory 
scores. In addition, linear discriminant analysis shows the ROC AUC of 
identifying MS patients with CI is 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.68-0.73). 
Our findings indicate that prosodic planning is deficient in patients with MS-CI 
and that the scope of planning depends on patients' cognitive abilities. We 
discuss how speech-based approaches could be used as an ecological method for 
the assessment and monitoring of CI in MS.

The purpose of this article is to explore whether any differences exist between 
the general population and patient based preferences towards EQ-5D-5L defined 
hypothetical health states. The article discusses the role of adaptation and 
self-interest in valuing health states and it also contributes rigorous 
empirical evidence to the scientific debate on the differences between the 
patient and general population preferences towards hypothetical health states. 
Patient preferences were elicited in 2015 with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire using 
time trade-off and discrete choice experiment design and compared to the Spanish 
general population preferences, which were elicited using identical methods. 
Patients were chosen on a voluntary basis according to their willingness to 
participate in the survey. They were recruited from patient organisations and a 
hospital in Madrid, Spain. 282 metastatic breast cancer patients and 333 
rheumatoid arthritis patients were included in the sample. The analysis revealed 
differences in preferences between the general population and patient groups. 
Based on the results of our analysis, it is suggested that the differences in 
preferences stem from patients being more able to accurately imagine 
"non-tangible" dimensions of health states (anxiety or depression, and pain or 
discomfort) than the general population with less experience in various health 
states. However, this does not mean that general public values should not be 
reflected in utilities derived for coverage decision making.

Behçet's disease is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune vasculitis characterized 
by a triad of key signs. We report the case of a 16-year-old Caucasian girl, who 
complained of headache, dizziness and paresis of the left side of her body. 
After physical examination and ancillary tests, she was diagnosed with Behçet's 
disease with neurological manifestations (neuro-Behçet's disease). She had a 
good response to treatment. IgG, IgA, IgM and albumin were quantified in serum 
and cerebrospinal fluid by single radial immunodiffusion. Intrathecal synthesis 
was found for the 3 classes of immunoglobulins. This is the first case in which 
the Reibergram was used to evaluate the neuroimmunological response in a patient 
with Behçet's disease, suggesting the use of this diagnostic means for the 
active phase of the disease.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: To analyze clinical characteristics of interstitial lung 
disease (ILD) associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially in patients 
with poor prognosis.
METHODS: Seventy-seven RA patients with ILD and 231 age, sex, and disease 
duration-matched RA patients without ILD were enrolled in this retrospective 
study. Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory information were obtained through 
a medical chart review. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the 
risk of mortality in RA patients with ILD.
RESULTS: Compared to the RA without ILD group, the RA with ILD group had 
significantly higher titers of rheumatoid factor and the anti-cyclic 
citrullinated peptide (p = 0.001 for both), higher levels of C-reactive protein 
(CRP) at the time of RA diagnosis (p = 0.014), and a higher erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (p = 0.022) and CRP levels (p < 0.001) throughout the 10-year 
follow-up period. These patients also received a higher mean daily dose of 
corticosteroids (p < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis of RA patients with ILD, 
28 patients (36.4%) died during follow-up. Multivariate analysis revealed that 
older age at the time of ILD diagnosis was significantly associated with 
mortality. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) subtype on high-resolution 
computed tomography (HRCT) was also suggested as a poor prognostic factor.
CONCLUSION: The survival of RA patients with ILD is adversely affected by age at 
the time of ILD diagnosis. RA-ILD patients diagnosed after age 65 or with a UIP 
subtype on HRCT may have a poor prognosis.

Author information:
(1)Bangor University, UK.

To explore experiences and perceptions of assistive technology, 14 people with 
multiple sclerosis, 5 carers and 4 occupational therapists participated in focus 
groups. Transcripts were analysed thematically drawing from illness 
self-regulation theory. Identified themes are as follows: critical multiple 
sclerosis events (developing symptoms/disability, delayed diagnosis and coping, 
public reaction and multiple sclerosis progression to assistive technology), 
matching assistive technology for continued use (acceptance of multiple 
sclerosis and assistive technology, realistic expectations, occupational 
therapist responsiveness, timing is crucial and carers and others) and impact of 
assistive technology (promoting or losing independence, stigma and embarrassment 
and redefining the carer). Acceptance and communication among those involved 
ensures assistive technology matches needs and maximises health and psychosocial 
outcomes.

We describe a 67-year-old man with immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) 
presenting with optic neuropathy, dacryoadenitis, periaortitis, retroperitoneal 
fibrosis, and a gastric mass-like lesion. A mass-like lesion measuring 
52 × 40 mm in the antrum of the stomach was found incidentally through 
whole-body screening for other organ involvement of IgG4-RD using 
contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Histology of the stomach revealed 
that the lesion was also IgG4-related and was located in the submucosal layer 
extending to the subserosal region. This case suggests that the stomach can also 
be a site of involvement of IgG4-RD.

Colton, CA.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe a case of an incarcerated adolescent with acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) presenting as acute psychosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective case report followed with chart and literature 
review.
MAIN FINDINGS: An adolescent with ADEM presented with drastic behavior and 
personality changes that led to her incarceration for serious charges. Acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis leads to neuropsychiatric effects and can be seen 
with magnetic resonance imaging as a large mass effect that may result in a poor 
prognosis. This adolescent made a full recovery from her left facial droop, 
slurred speech, and left-sided hemiplegia, and her personality changes were 
reverted.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can present as acute 
psychosis; therefore, clinical suspicion is important when treating patients who 
have a history of past infectious brain diseases, especially encephalitis. Given 
the rapid onset of disease, physicians must be knowledgeable of the diagnosis 
and treatment of ADEM and be vigilant in finding organic causes of acute 
psychosis.

A 41-year-old man was diagnosed with immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) 
in both eyelids 4 years ago and exhibited good response to steroid therapy. 
However, rapid swelling of the right eyelid lesion was recently observed. As 
IgG4-RD progression was suspected, biopsy was performed. Although the histology 
was consistent with IgG4-RD, the infiltrating large atypical lymphoid cells 
showed immunoglobulin light-chain restriction and IgH gene rearrangement. 
Consequently, he was diagnosed with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma with 
abundant IgG4-positive cells.

We report the case of a 66-year-old man with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis 
who developed neurologically asymptomatic rheumatoid meningitis (RM) revealed by 
MRI. RM worsened and chest CT showed pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and 
bilateral consolidation, and his serum C3 level was decreased. We diagnosed 
systemic rheumatic vasculitis based on these findings. After a review of more 
than 20 previously reported cases of RM, this is the first case of RM without 
central nerve system symptoms.

A 20-year-old man presented with recurrent hemoptysis for seven months. A small 
subpleural nodule in his right lower lobe was found and excised surgically. 
Based on the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and vascular wall 
hypertrophy without vasculitis or an intraluminal thrombus, nonthrombotic 
proliferative vasculopathy (NTPV) affecting pulmonary arteries was diagnosed. 
Recently, aPL have been postulated to directly induce the proliferation of 
vascular cells in the intima and media, leading to NTPV. We review 5 cases of 
NTPV-associated aPL with critical ischemia in the lower extremities and 
gastrointestinal infarction. NTPV-associated aPL might be distinct from classic 
antiphospholipid syndrome and should be considered in aPL-positive patients who 
present with vascular occlusions of medium-sized vessels in the absence of 
atherosclerotic risk factors and systemic or local inflammation.

Control of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity is an important factor 
related to the development of hallux valgus (HV) deformity. Furthermore, if 
valgus hindfoot remains and/or appears after HV surgery, the affected foot is at 
risk of recurrence of HV deformity. We experienced a case suggesting the 
possibility that hindfoot valgus deformity appeared after HV surgery because of 
poor control of RA disease activity, and the HV deformity recurred in the very 
early period after surgery.

The mediating effect of acceptance and mindfulness in the relationship between 
pain, depression, and physical disability was examined in 55 rheumatoid 
arthritis patients. Results showed that the relationship between pain and 
depression was mediated by both nonreact and acceptance. By contrast, the 
relationship between pain and physical disability was mediated by acceptance but 
not by nonreact. This study provides evidences that the influence of these 
processes is different on depression and on physical disability. These findings 
support models that take both general measures of mindfulness and 
content-specific measures of acceptance into account when conceptualizing 
rheumatoid arthritis. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

This study explored the association between parental fear of hypoglycemia, 
anxiety, and subjective well-being in parents of children and adolescents with 
type 1 diabetes. A total of 120 mothers and 79 fathers participated. Mothers' 
and fathers' fear of hypoglycemia was significantly associated with anxiety and 
negative affect as well as with worse glycemic control in child. Paired-samples 
t-test showed that mothers were more involved in diabetes management and 
reported more fear and anxiety compared to fathers, but they did not differ in 
worries about hypoglycemia. The findings suggest screening for fear of 
hypoglycemia and subjective well-being in all parents regardless of whether 
their child experienced severe hypoglycemia.

BACKGROUND: The increase of circulating urokinase plasminogen activator receptor 
(suPAR) was demonstrated in various diseases showing its prognostic value as 
well as the link to the inflammatory reaction. In glomerular diseases, suPAR was 
considered a causative factor of proteinuria. In the present study we aimed to 
evaluate serum concentration of suPAR in children with primary and secondary 
glomerulonephritis (GN) and its association with disease severity.
METHODS: The study involved 22 children with minimal change disease (MCD), nine 
with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), seven with 
Henoch-Schönlein nephritis, seven with lupus nephritis (LN) and 16 controls.
RESULTS: Serum suPAR was significantly higher in children with FSGS and LN than 
controls (4.47±1.39 ng/mL vs. 3.23±0.76 ng/mL; P=0.011 and 6.17±1.12 ng/mL vs. 
3.23±0.76 ng/mL, respectively; P<0.0001). Further, suPAR was increased in LN 
when compared to FSGS (P=0.031). In the total group suPAR showed negative 
correlation with eGFR, serum complement C3 and positive with left ventricular 
mass index. In children with MCD and FSGS the inverse association of suPAR with 
eGFR was also shown.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with primary and secondary glomerulonephritis suPAR 
levels are not associated with proteinuria. In primary GN elevated suPAR levels 
may result from reduced eGFR reflecting renal damage. In LN circulating suPAR 
can be increased further indicating both multi-organ involvement and systemic 
inflammation reflecting disease severity.

Chylous polyserositis and autoimmune myelofibrosis occurring concomitantly inn a 
case of SLE are a rare phenomenon. We here report a case of a 38-year-old woman 
who was admitted with a history of cough and shortness of breath for 1½ months 
along with fever and abdominal distension for 1 month. She also had arthralgias, 
weight loss and pancytopenia. She was diagnosed as a case of SLE with Chylous 
polyserositis and autoimmune myelofibrosis. She was started on steroids and 
immunosuppressive therapy, to which she responded. To summarize, this is the 
first case report where chylous polyserositis and pancytopenia due to autoimmune 
myelofibrosis occurred which was responsive to steroids and immunosuppressive 
therapy.
